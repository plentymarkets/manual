== Legal information

In this menu, you can save your **terms and conditions**, **cancellation rights**, **privacy policy** and **legal disclosure** for a **client** (store). Use **template variables** to display the content in the store and in the e-mail templates. Furthermore, if you use an external service provider to automatically update the legal texts whenever laws change, then the current texts are found here. The advantage is that if you ever have to make changes, then you only need to edit the particular texts in this one menu. The changes then go into effect for all of the documents that are linked.

== Entering text

Save a copy of your terms and conditions, privacy policy and legal disclosure in every available **__language__**. You can save the documents as pure **text** or in **HTML** format.

[NOTE]
.Entering text
====
Open a language and enter the legal texts in this language.

== Inserting template variables and template functions

As described above, **template variables** and **template functions** are used to insert the legal information. Use template variables to insert content, i.e. texts, into category pages or e-mail templates. Use template functions to insert the category pages into the design. Create **<<item/categories/editing-content-categories#, categories of the type content  >>** for legal information.

=== Template variables for category pages

The template variables for category pages contain the text that was entered into the **HTML** tab. When a category page is accessed in the online store, the template variable will display the text that was saved for the particular language and store. As described in section 2, you must have entered text for the language and the store.

Image 2 shows the template variable for the terms and conditions in the store's terms and conditions category page.

=== Template functions for linking category pages

The following is an overview of the template functions that need to be inserted into the design in order to link to category pages. +
Go to **<<client-store/standard/online-store/content-pages#, Settings » Client (store) » Standard » Online store » Pages  >>** and link the category pages so that the template functions display content. This can also be done design specifically in the **<<cms/web-design/editing-the-web-design#, CMS » Web design » Settings » Design settings » Tab: Clients  >>** menu. +
The advantage of these template functions is that they do not need to be edited when copying the design for a different client. If you use the template function **Link()**, then you will have to change the ID for every client.

The following table explains the **template functions** for **__linking__** category pages:

=== Template variables for e-mail templates

The process of integrating texts into **e-mail templates** is similar. However, e-mail templates require you to distinguish whether the e-mail should be sent as pure **text** or as an **HTML** e-mail. Consequently, two template variables are available for all legal information e-mail templates.

The following table explains the **template variables** for **e-mail templates**:

[cols="a,a"]
|====
|Template variables |Explanation

|**$GeneralTermsAndConditionsText**
|Terms and conditions, text

|**$GeneralTermsAndConditionsHTML**
|Terms and conditions, HTML

|**$CancellationRightsText**
|Cancellation rights, text

|**$CancellationRightsHTML**
|Cancellation rights, HTML

|**$PrivacyPolicyText**
|Privacy policy, text

|**$PrivacyPolicyHTML**
|Privacy policy, HTML

|**$LegalDisclosureText**
|Legal disclosure, text

|**$LegalDisclosureHTML**
