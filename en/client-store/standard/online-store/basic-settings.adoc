| Settings | Explanation

|**Upload Favicon**
| If desired, upload an icon here which marks your store and is shown, for instance, in the address line of the browser to the left of the URL. +
**Important**: Only icons with the data format .ico can be used. +
For further information about favicons, refer to the web, e.g. link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Favicon[**Wikipedia**, window="_blank"].

|**Document type declaration**
| Select the appropriate HTML version for your online store. The setting will also go into effect for all available clients. The options **HTML 5**, **HTML 4.0 Transitional (default setting)**, **HTML 4.01 Transitional** and **XHTML 1.0 Transitional** are available. +
There are so-called document type definitions for HTML. They define which elements can be included in an HTML document, which elements can appear inside of other elements, which attributes belong to an element, whether or not it is mandatory to specify these attributes etc. +
**Important**: Note that different elements are available depending on which HTML version is used. This means that the codes you are using must correspond to the HTML version that you select here. Otherwise, non-compatible elements will not be displayed or will be interpreted differently. +
The following website provides an overview of the elements found in various HTML versions and information on CSS formatting: +

|**Price column**
| Select the price column of the price which you want to be displayed as standard price in your online store or client (store). The selected price will also be used for discounts. +
Set up an individual price column as the standard price for each online store or client (store). +
**Important**: This setting is only relevant to the order process. It does not have an influence on the item and category layouts in the online store.

|**Cross-selling**
| Select a setting for cross-selling offers in the online store.

|**Dynamic cross-selling**
| Select **Yes** for dynamic cross-selling. plentymarkets creates cross-selling links automatically. This means that if two items are bought together, then they will automatically be entered as **<<item/managing-items#950., cross-selling items >>** for each other.

|**Validity of session cookie**
| Choose between **until the browser is closed** and **one hundred days, even if the browser is closed**.

|**Request security code in contact forms**
| A security code is requested in contact forms for sending e-mails. +
One example is the <<marketing/tell-a-friend-e-mail#, **tell-a-friend e-mail**  >>. +
Select **No** if no security code is to be requested. **Yes** is set up by default.

|**Number of invalid login attempts per day**
| Enter how many login attempts for the store you want to allow customers per day. A login attempt is made when incorrect access data is entered. Correct logins are not counted in this number. You can select between 4 and 25 attempts. +
**Caution**: The higher the number, the more times a user - as well as an unauthorized person! - can attempt to log into the website by trying out different combinations of access data. Therefore, you should take extra care when setting this option. The next day, the customer will again have the same number of login attempts available.

|**Login**
| Decide whether it should only be possible to log into the particular online store, i.e. client (store), or into all online stores.

|**Precautionary statement in case of overselling**
| If you select the setting **active**, then a precautionary statement will be displayed in the order process if overselling occurs, i.e. if the order quantity exceeds the net stock of the corresponding item. The purchaser will be informed that the delivery may be delayed. Condition for the note: the item's stock must be positive and the setting No limitation must be selected (item's tab: Stock subtab: **Settings**).
