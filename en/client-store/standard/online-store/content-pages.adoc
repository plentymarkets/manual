== General information about the Pages menu

Link **category pages** in this menu. The pages listed here are included in nearly every **online store**. Some of the pages linked in this menu contain **<<client-store/standard/online-store/legal-information#, legal information  >>**. +
By linking pages, you can use specific **template functions** in the design, e.g. Link_CancelationRights. These links are advantageous if you also use the same design in a different plentymarkets store. In this case, the same links would work in both stores.

[IMPORTANT]
.Links in the store design
====
Standard plentymarkets designs such as **stonepattern_green** contain links to many of the pages that are selected here. The links are often in **PageDesignContentMainFrame** by default.
====

== Configuration

Link the pages for every **client**. This menu only includes **<<item/categories/editing-content-categories#, categories of the type content  >>**.

[IMPORTANT]
.Category links that were saved in the design take priority over links that are saved here.
====
The links carried out in the **Settings » Client (store) » Standard » Online store » Pages** menu do not apply to designs for which category links were carried out in the **CMS » Web design » Settings » Design settings » Tab: Clients** menu. Design specific category links take priority.
