== Trusted Shops

Trusted Shops is the well-known Trustbadge for online stores, which provides buyer protection for online customers.

== Trusted Shops buyer protection

You need to carry out two steps to integrate the Trusted Shops buyer protection. In the first step, select the buyer protection model and configure it to be displayed to the customer during the checkout process. Most customers choose the free **Classic buyer protection** model. However, you can also use the **Excellence buyer protection** model. In the second step, **insert** the **Trusted Shops Trustbadge** into your online store.

=== Buyer protection models

The **Excellence** model offers protection for orders with a total value of up to 20,000- Euro. A small fee is charged for this service. The Excellence model treats buyer protection like an item that has been placed in the shopping cart. This means that buyer protection is automatically activated upon completion of the purchase. If you want to use this buyer protection model, then you have to order it at Trusted Shops. The configuration is described in the following sections.

The **Classic** model is free of charge. Purchases with a value of up to 2,500- Euro can be protected. The buyer protection model is offered to customers directly after they have made their purchase.

If a valid Trusted Shops ID was saved, then customers will see a button that they can click on to register for buyer protection during the order confirmation. Customers who click on the button will be forwarded to Trusted Shops. For further information about saving the Trusted Shops ID in plentymarkets, refer to section 3 of this page.

**Please note the following:**

* The form for buyer protection registration is only shown on the day of purchase.
* The form will be hidden for purchases made on eBay and other markets.

[WARNING]
.Trusted Shops ID
====
If an error should occur here, please note that it is not possible to activate a Trusted Shops ID for the same domain but for different languages. However, this is not the case when activating a Trusted Shop ID for a client (store) that is located on a subdomain (e.g. "test.test-store.com"). For further information, refer to link:https://www.trustedshops.co.uk/merchants/[**Trusted Shops**, window="_blank"] and the link:http://www.trustedshops.co.uk/merchants/service.html#topic=ratings[**Trusted Shops FAQ**, window="_blank"]. The **Trusted Shops IDs** which you save here form the basis for the Trusted Shops Trustbadge and the classic buyer protection. A Trusted Shops ID is only valid for an online store certified by Trusted Shops as well as for a specific language.

=== Integrating the Trusted Shops Seller Rating

If a Trusted Shops ID is activated, then insert the template variables for Trusted Shops (widget and "write a reviews" icon) into the online store. For further information, refer to the **<<marketing/trusted-shops/seller-rating#, Seller rating  >>** page of the manual.

== Integrating the Trusted Shops Trustbadge in your online store

Check the **requirements** for the integration of the Trusted Shops Trustbadge:

* You have saved a valid Trusted Shops ID in the **Trustbadge** tab (section 2).
* You have configured the Trustbadge and saved the Trustbadge as well as the background graphic on your computer.

[.instruction]
Integrating the Trusted Shops Trustbadge in your online store:

. Click on **Upload files** and upload the **Trusted Shops Trustbadge** from your local hard drive into your plentymarkets system. If desired, load the **background graphic** as well.
. Copy the **Trustbadge's URL** (Ctrl or cmd + C). In the HTML editing window of the **Trustbadge** tab, mark the URL behind **src=** and enter the URL from the clipboard there (Ctrl or cmd + V).
. Copy the **URL of the background graphic** and insert it into the HTML editing window instead of the URL behind the HTML entry **background-image: url** in the HTML code.
