==  Managing localized documents

There are several documents that can be configured differently for every location. These documents can be found in the **Documents** folder of each location. On the <<orders/settings/documents#, **Documents**  >> page of the manual you will learn how to apply default settings or how to apply settings from other templates as well as how to edit these settings. You will also learn how to create a business letterhead in PDF format, how to use this PDF as a PDF template and how to link it to the documents. You will also learn how to create and manage numbering systems. Finally, this page includes tax information that is relevant to documents.

==  User rights

You can manage the access to documents with user rights. These rights are defined in the <<working-with-plentymarkets/manage-users#90., **user's rights** >> tab. You need to open the subtab **Menu** to give a user the right for the documents menu.

==  Additional documents

Documents that do not need to be customized for a location such as e.g. address labels and pick lists are configured in the <<orders/settings/documents#, **Settings » Orders » Documents »**  >> menu.
