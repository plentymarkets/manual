A link cloud is an arrangement of links to different items. These links have different font sizes and are sorted randomly. The font size of a link is assigned automatically based on the number of search results. As such, an item with many search results is displayed in large font. You save the search tags and links for inserting a link cloud into your online store in the **Settings » Client (store) » Standard » Modules » Item link cloud** menu. Proceed as described below to create link cloud for your items.

== Defining search tags

First define the search tags, i.e. the terms that items are linked to and that the items can be found under. Usually the names of items or categories are used as search tags. You can also select search tags that do not reflect the item names directly. For example, enter **glasses** as a search tag to list items with different names. The tag **glasses** will list all glasses that you have in stock. Note that you might have to spell items with a hyphen. For example, the item **sunglasses** will not be found. However, it is found if spelled with a hyphen, as **sun-glasses**.

[TIP]
.Tip: Font sizes
====
The differences in font sizes are calculated with the help of a specific mechanism. The font sizes differ most if you use as many links as possible with a variety of search results.
