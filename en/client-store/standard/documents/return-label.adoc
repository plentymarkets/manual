Customers use return labels to send back items. plentymarkets includes pre-configured templates, which you can edit as desired. The document **Return label** can be configured separately for each language. This document is edited in the menu **plentymarkets » Settings » Client (store) » Select store » Locations » Select location » Documents » Return label**.

== Information on the return label

The return label includes mandatory elements such as the **Reason for return**. It also includes several optional elements. For example, you can add additional columns to the table and allow customers to specify the quantity and reason for return in these columns.

== Configuring the return label document

This chapter teaches you how to configure the document. You will learn how to set up the template within the **Documents** menu, how to apply settings from one template to another, how to save a PDF template and how to set up a numbering system.

=== Applying default settings

The **Transfer** tab allows you to apply default settings to your template, i.e. to reset your template to its default values. The tab also allows you to apply your template's settings to another template, e.g. to the delivery note. For example, you may want to give your template the default settings if it does not yet contain any settings. For further information, refer to the **Documents** page of the manual. Specifically, refer to the <<orders/settings/documents#140, **Copying settings** >> chapter.

=== Setting up the template

You have to set up a **template** before you can generate return labels. For further information about the configuration, refer to the **Documents** page of the manual. Specifically, refer to the <<orders/settings/documents#40, **Configuring document templates** >> chapter.

[IMPORTANT]
.Positioning with coordinates
====
Use **x** and **y coordinates** to position the content within the template. The starting point is the upper left corner of the page.
====

You can save a note on the return label, which informs customers that they will need to enter the quantity of returned items and the reason for the return.

[NOTE]
.Saving the notification, return quantity and reason
====
Scroll down to the **Positioning the mandatory elements** area and save the notification in the **Reason for return** field. Enter a note, e.g. **Enter the quantity of returned items and the reason**. Next save empty columns where customers can enter the quantity and reason. Scroll down to the **Columns stock units** area and save text for the column headers into the fields **Return quantity** and **Reason**. These columns will be displayed in the item table. Customers can enter their information directly on the return label and then send it back. Enter the texts and specify the **Font size**, **Position** and **Width** (in mm).

=== Applying settings

The **Transfer** tab allows you to copy the settings in the return label's **Template** tab and then apply these settings to a different document, e.g. to a delivery note. For further information, refer to the **Documents** page of the manual. Specifically, refer to the <<orders/settings/documents#140, **Copying settings** >> chapter.

=== Saving PDF templates

Once you have set up the return label template you can upload a PDF file e.g. with your company logo in the **PDF template** tab. The PDF file has to be on your computer first. For further information, refer to the **Documents** page of the manual. Specifically, refer to the <<orders/settings/documents#170, **PDF template** >> chapter.

=== Creating a numbering system

Use the template's **Numbering** tab to specify how the documents should be numbered. For further information, refer to the **Documents** page of the manual. Specifically, refer to the <<orders/settings/documents#200, **Numbering** >> chapter.
