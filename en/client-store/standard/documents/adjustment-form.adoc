The document **Adjustment form** can be configured separately for each language. This document is edited in the menu **Settings » Client (store) » Select store » Locations » Select location » Documents » Adjustment form**.

==  Setting up an adjustment form

This chapter teaches you how to configure the document. You will learn how to set up the template within the **Documents** menu, how to apply settings from one template to another, how to save a PDF template and how to set up a numbering system.

===  Applying default settings

The **Transfer** tab allows you to apply default settings to your template, i.e. to reset your template to its default values. The tab also allows you to apply your template's settings to another template, e.g. to the delivery note. For example, you may want to give your template the default settings if it does not yet contain any settings. For further information, refer to the **Documents** page of the manual. Specifically, refer to the <<orders/settings/documents#140, **Applying settings** >> chapter.

===  Setting up a template

You have to set up a template before you can print adjustment forms. For further information about the configuration, refer to the **Documents** page of the manual. Specifically, refer to the <<orders/settings/documents#40, **Configuring document templates** >> chapter.

The **Transfer** tab allows you to copy the settings in the adjustment form's **Template** tab and then apply these settings to a different document, e.g. to a delivery note. For further information, refer to the **Documents** page of the manual. Specifically, refer to the <<orders/settings/documents#140, **Applying settings** >> chapter.

===  Saving PDF templates

Once you have set up the invoice template you can upload a PDF file e.g. with your company logo in the **PDF template** tab. The PDF file has to be on your computer first. For further information, refer to the **Documents** page of the manual. Specifically, refer to the <<orders/settings/documents#170, **PDF template** >> chapter.

===  Creating a numbering system

Use the template's **Numbering** tab to specify how the documents should be numbered. For further information, refer to the **Documents** page of the manual. Specifically, refer to the <<orders/settings/documents#200, **Numbering** >> chapter.
