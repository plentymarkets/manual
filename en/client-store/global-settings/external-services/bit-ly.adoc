== Example of use

This service for shortening URLs is e.g. used for automatic tweets that are generated via the <<client-store/global-settings/live-shopping#100, **Procedure manager** >>. In this case, the URLs of the category pages will automatically be shortened, e.g. for the **Tweet live shopping offers** procedure. This way, more characters will be left for the rest of the message.
