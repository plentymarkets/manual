[IMPORTANT]
.Three OTTO interfaces
====
The market OTTO offers three interfaces: *Direktversand*, *Cooperation*, and *Integration*. All interfaces are supported by plentymarkets. +
There is a difference in the order import for the interfaces. When using the *Direktversand* and *Cooperation* interfaces, OTTO transfers individual orders to your plentymarkets system which you can process and ship directly to your end customers. +
With the *Integration* interface, your plentymarkets system exchanges one multi-order per day with OTTO. In this case, OTTO ships the ordered items to the end customers.
