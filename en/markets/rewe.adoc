== About REWE

REWE.de was the first German food retailer to offer groceries online. Now customers can buy their groceries online via their mobile phone in 75 German cities.  

REWE Marktplatz is a German marketplace for groceries and kitchen and household items. In order to ensure REWE's high quality standards, only selected partners are allowed to offer their products on the REWE marketplace. The one-stop-shopping concept invites customers to do their daily shopping on the REWE marketplace, thus facilitating millions of people's everyday lives.     The REWE Marktplatz is based on the e-commerce platform commercetools.

[#100]

After you have installed the REWE plugin, carry out an authentication to enable access to the interface.

[.instruction]
Activating the access to the interface:

. Go to *Setup » Markets » REWE » Account settings*.
. Enter the access data that you have received from REWE into the fields *User name*, *Password*, and *Product key*.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

[#400]
== Activating the automatic data exchange

Open the *Setup » Markets » REWE » Basic Settings* menu to set up the market REWE in plentymarkets. Activate the item export, the stock and price synchronisation, and the order import in this menu so that data is exchanged with REWE automatically.

[.instruction]
Activating the automatic data exchange:

. Go to *Setup » Markets » REWE » Basic settings*.
. Activate the options *Item export*, *Stock and price update*, and *Order import* to activate the automatic data exchange with REWE.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

[#450]
== Defining stock export

By default, the stock information for each variation is exported based on the option you selected for the *Limitation* setting. You can also ignore this setting and instead export the actual net stock for all variations to REWE.

[.instruction]
Defining stock export:

. Go to *Setup » Markets » REWE » Basic settings*.
. Select an option for *Export stock*. Pay attention to the explanations given in <<#rewe-stock>>.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

[[rewe-stock]]
.Defining stock export
[cols="1,3a"]
|====
|Setting |Explanation

| *Export stock*
a| * *Consider variation setting 'Limitation'* (default setting) = Stock is exported as specified for each variation. Stock limitation is managed in the *Item » Edit item » [Open item] » [Open variation] » Tab: Settings » Area: Availability* menu using the option *Limitation*. +
*_Note:_* For variations for which the *Limitation* setting is set to *Do not administer stock for this variation*, a stock of 1000 is exported to REWE. +
* *Export actual net stock* = The stock *Limit* setting is ignored for all variations during export to REWE. Instead, the actual net stock is exported to REWE for each variation. You can check the actual net stock in the *Item » Edit item » [Open item] » [Open variation] » Tab: Stock » Tab: Stock* menu in the column *Net*. +
*_Note:_* For variations for which the *Limitation* setting is set to *Do not administer stock for this variation*, a stock of 0 is exported to REWE. As such, the variation cannot be bought on REWE. +
*_Tip:_* The net stock is the quantity of a variation that is available for sale. The net stock is a subset of the physical stock. Substract all reserved quantities from the physical stock and you will get the net stock.

[#500]
== Setting the commission

[TIP]
.Commission settings are optional
====
The settings for the commission for REWE are optional. If you do not set a commission, orders will be imported into plentymarkets with the sales prices that are displayed at REWE. +
If no commission is set, prices will also be displayed without commission on the delivery note.
====

The standard commission is set up in the *Setup » Markets » REWE » Basic settings* menu. The commission serves to calculate the order sums free of commission.

Order sums free of commission are calculated with this formula:

* Sales price REWE = Sales price customer * (1 - conversion factor)
* Conversion factor = Commission * (1 + VAT rate)

For the calculation, the percentages for commission and VAT rate are converted into the corresponding factor, that is, divided by 100. The conversion factor is rounded to 3 decimal places.

[.instruction]
Setting the commission:

. Go to *Setup » Markets » REWE » Basic settings*.
. In the *Commission* area, enter a number for the commission in percent.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings. +
→ The commission is the default commission for all items except for any variations for which a separate commission was set up.

You can set up a separate commission for variations. To do so, use the *REWE commission* variation property. The variation property *REWE commission* is created automatically when the REWE plugin is installed. In order to set up a separate commission for a variation, link the variation to the variation property *REWE commission*.

[.instruction]
Setting up a separate commission for variations:

. Go to *Item » Edit item*.
. Open the item.
. Click on the *Variations* tab.
. Open the variation that you would like to set up a separate commission for.
. Open the variation's *Properties* tab.
. From the *Properties* drop-down list, select *REWE commission*.
. Click on *Add* (icon:plus-square[role="green"]). +
→ The property is linked to the variation.
. Enter a whole number or a decimal number into the *Value* field for the commission in percent.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

[#800]
== Linking variations with the property REWE product type

Variations that you want to sell on REWE have to be linked with the *REWE product type* variation property. This variation property is created in your plentymarkets system as soon as you have installed the REWE plugin. Examples for REWE product types are:

* Household
* Garden
* Fashion

:property-link: REWE product type
:property-selection:
:property-link-info: The REWE product types can be selected.

include::_textblocks/instructions/properties-link-to-variation.adoc[]

[#900]
== Setting up the item export

Item data is exported to REWE via catalogues. The assistant *Creating REWE catalogues* helps you to create a catalogue for a specific product category. Is this your first time working with catalogues? Then read up on the <<en/data/exporting-data/managing-catalogues, principle of catalogues first>>. For further information about the plentymarkets data fields that can be linked, refer to the <<data/exporting-data/managing-catalogues#_mapping_data_sources, Mapping data fields>> chapter.

At present, the REWE plugin allows you to create catalogues for the following REWE product categories:

* *Household*
* *Multimedia*
* *Drugstore*
* *Fashion*
* *Leisure/sports*
* *Stationary*
* *Toys*
* *Garden*
* *Baby Supplies*
* *Contact Lenses*
* *New Media (DVD etc.)*
* *Books and Magazines*
* *AFG* (Soft Drinks)
* *Alcoholic beverages*
* *Food* +
*_Information for the food product category:_* +
  ** Food specifications must always be made for 100g.
  ** Energy information must be provided in kcal.
  ** If the *Nutrition information for prepared and non-prepared foods* field is not mapped, the value *non-prepared* is transferred to REWE by default.

[#1001]
=== Notes on the REWE item data structure: product groups and variations

REWE differentiates between *product groups* and *variation groups*.

[cols="1,5a"]
|====
| Product group
|
* The variations look different.
* As a result, every plentymarkets variation has its own images.
* Product group attributes are attributes that influence how the product looks

*_Examples:_*

* An item is sold in different colours and/or with different prints.
* An item is sold in different sizes and the packaging for each size is different.

*_In plentymarkets:_*

In plentymarkets, product groups are items with variations with at least one REWE group attribute, depending on the product type.

*_Example for attribute:_*

For the product type Food, the following *Attributes for product group* are available (as of 05/2021):

* Flavour
* Package size
* Variety

*_Notes on mapping data fields:_*

Items in plentymarkets can have more than one REWE group attribute. However, only one REWE group attribute can be used to form product groups. Therefore, the *Attribute for product group* field has to be matched so that the first attribute will always be the attribute that you want to use to form a product group. If an item differs in colour and print and the print should be used as the REWE group attribute, you first have to map the print in the marketplace data field *Attribute for product group* and only then map the colour.

*_Tip:_*

The REWE group attributes for each product type are available in the catalogue templates. To do so, open the drop-down list *Attribute for product group* in the marketplace format.

| Variations
|
* The variations look the same.
* As a result, the images for all variations are identical.
* Variation attributes are attributes that do not influence how the product looks.

*_Examples:_*

* An item is available in different sizes. All sizes look the same.
* An item is available in different package sizes. However, the images are identical for all variations.

*_In plentymarkets:_*

In plentymarkets, *variations* are variations of an item no more than one REWE variation attribute, depending on the product type.

*_Example for attribute:_*

For the product type Food, the following *Attributes for variation group* are available (as of 05/2021):

* Diameter
* Dimensions
* General size

*_Notes on mapping data fields:_*

* For REWE variation attributes, only one variation attribute can be set, for example only size or only volume.
* An item should not be linked to more than one attribute which was assigned as REWE variation attribute in the catalogue.

*_Tip:_*

The REWE variation attributes for each product type are available in the catalogue templates. To do so, open the drop-down list *Attribute for variation group* in the marketplace format.

[.collapseBox]
.Step *Mapping basic data fields*
--
In this step of the assistant, you decide which variation data saved in plentymarkets you want to send to the market. To do so, you are going to map each data field of the market with the plentymarkets data field that contains the data that you want to export to the market. Instead of mapping an existing data field, you can also instead create a new data field for some fields.

'''
*SKU* = From the drop-down list, select the data field in plentymarkets that contains the SKU. +
*_Recommendation:_* The variation ID is unique for each variation. Map the marketplace data field *SKU* to the plentymarkets data field *Variation ID*.
*_Note:_* Do not change the SKU and Parent SKU of a variation once the variation has been created on commercetools.

'''
*Select data field* = A data field that already exists in plentymarkets will be exported to REWE. Select a data field from the drop-down list *Data field*. +
*_Note:_* The mappings you create will not be checked in terms of logic. As such, check your mappings carefully before starting the export.

'''
*Create property* = Creates a <<item/settings/properties#500, property>> and maps this property to the data field. Properties can be used to export values for data fields that have no corresponding item data saved in plentymarkets, such as *Diameter*.

Automatically created property will be saved in the <<item/settings/properties#500, Setup » Settings » Properties » Configuration>> menu.

Automatically created properties are created with the following settings:

* Section = Item
* Property type = _depending on the market data field_
* Language = German
* Name = _Name of the product category_
* Group = REWE

'''
*Creating a sales price* = Creates a sales price and maps this sales price to the data field. You can check and edit automatically created sales prices in the <<en/item/settings/prices#400, Setup » Item » Sales prices>> menu.

Automatically created sales prices are created with the following settings:

* Subscription interval = None
* Internal name = REWE
* External name = REWE
* Minimum quantity = 1
* Live conversion = No
* Currency = Euro
* Display = Always display for new items
* Client = ALL
* Class = ALL
* Country = Germany

'''
*Create barcode* = Creates a barcode *REWE* and maps this barcode to the data field. If a barcode with the name *REWE* already exists in the system, that barcode is mapped instead. You can check and edit automatically created barcodes in the <<en/item/settings/barcodes#100, Setup » Item » Barcodes>> menu.
--

[#600]
=== Mapping additional data fields in the catalogue (not in assistant)

You have already mapped important mandatory fields for the REWE product category in the assistant. However, after you have completed the assistant, you need to map additional data fields to send more information regarding your products to REWE.

:catalogue-assistant:

include::_textblocks/instructions/catalogue-map-data-fields.adoc[]

[#905]
=== Particularities for mapping data fields

Every market structures item data differently. As such, there are some particularities for each market when mapping data fields. <<#catalogue-rewe-mappings>> contains mapping information for important data fields for REWE.

[[catalogue-rewe-mappings]]
.Notes on mapping data fields
[cols="1,3a"]
|====
| Marketplace data field | plentymarkets data field

| *SKU*
| We recommend to link the data field *SKU* with the plentymarkets data field *Variation ID* because the variation ID is clearly assigned to the variation. +
*_Note:_* Do not change the SKU and Parent SKU of a variation once the variation has been created on commercetools. If you change the SKU or the Parent SKU later, the variation will no longer be updated on commercetools.

| *Attribute for product group*
| As <<#1001, described above>>, REWE distinguishes between product bgroups and variation groups.

*_Reminder:_* You need a REWE product group if the variations of an item have different images because they look different. Product group attributes are attributes that influence how the product looks.

As such, you would pap the following plentymarkets data field to the marketplace data field *Attribute for product group*:

* *_Alternative 1:_* An attribute that changes the look of the variations
* *_Alternative 2:_* A property that changes the look of the variations

Of course you can also map fallback data fields. This might be necessary if you use both attributes and properties in plentymarkets for the data that you want to export for the marketplace data field *Attribute for product group*.

[.collapseBox]
.*_Example 1:_* Mapping colour information for product type "Fashion"
--
The following example describes how you can map colour information in a catalogue for the product type "Fashion".

* The colour changes how the variations look. Because of this, you specify the colours using the marketplace data field *Attribute for product group*.
