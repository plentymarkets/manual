[IMPORTANT]
.Download the REWE plugin
====
You need a plugin to link plentymarkets to REWE. Visit the link:https://marketplace.plentymarkets.com/en/plugins/sales/marktplaetze/rewe_5901[plentyMarketplace^]{nbsp}icon:external-link[] to download the REWE plugin.
====

[#100]
== Registering with REWE

REWE is a closed marketplace. Therefore, REWE will carry out a number of checks before you can register as a seller. Contact REWE at partnersupport@rewe.de and provide the following information:

* Name of your company
* your company's website or your online shop
* list of your product range (number of SKUs, categories, required specifications)
* contact information

For further information on the check and the registration as seller, contact REWE at partnersupport@rewe.de.

After you have registered as a seller, you will receive access data from REWE.


[IMPORTANT]
.Assigning rights
====
When creating the API client credentials at REWE, make sure to assign enough rights. Select the *Admin client* template or create a new client and assign all rights that are available.
====

After installing the REWE plugin, the following automatic processes are available:

* daily item export
* stock synchronisation every 15 minutes
* hourly price synchronisation
* order import every 15 minutes

[#200]
== Installing REWE in plentymarkets

After buying the REWE plugin in the plentyMarketplace, install the market in the *Plugins » Plugin overview* menu.

[#300]
=== Authentication

After you have installed the REWE plugin, carry out an authentication to enable access to the interface.

[.instruction]
Activating the access to the interface:

. Go to *Setup » Markets » REWE » Account settings*.
. Enter the access data that you have received from REWE into the fields *User name*, *Password*, and *Product key*.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

[#400]
== Activating the automatic data exchange

Open the *Setup » Markets » REWE » Basic Settings* menu to set up the market REWE in plentymarkets. Activate the item export, the stock and price synchronisation, and the order import in this menu so that data is exchanged with REWE automatically.

[.instruction]
Activating the automatic data exchange:

. Go to *Setup » Markets » REWE » Basic settings*.
. Activate the options *Item export*, *Stock and price update*, and *Order import* to activate the automatic data exchange with REWE.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

[#450]
== Defining stock export

By default, the stock information for each variation is exported based on the option you selected for the *Limitation* setting. From plugin version 1.18.0 and higher, you can also ignore this setting and instead export the actual net stock for all variations to REWE.

[.instruction]
Defining stock export:

. Go to *Setup » Markets » REWE » Basic settings*.
. Select an option for *Export stock*. Pay attention to the explanations given in <<#rewe-stock>>.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

[cols="1,3"]
|====
|Setting |Explanation

| *Export stock* +
(plugin version 1.18.0 and higher)
a| * *Consider variation setting 'Limitation'* (default setting) = Stock is exported as specified for each variation. Stock limitation is managed in the *Item » Edit item »* _Open item_ *» Tab: Variation ID » Tab: Settings » Area: Availability* menu using the option *Limitation*. +
*_Note:_* For variations for which the *Limitation* setting is set to *Do not administer stock for this variation*, a stock of 1000 is exported to REWE. +
* *Export actual net stock* = The stock *Limit* setting is ignored for all variations during export to REWE. Instead, the actual net stock is exported to REWE for each variation. You can check the actual net stock in the *Item » Edit item »* _Open item_ *» Tab: Variation ID » Tab: Stock » Tab: Stock* menu in the column *Net*. +
*_Note:_* For variations for which the *Limitation* setting is set to *Do not administer stock for this variation*, a stock of 0 is exported to REWE. As such, the variation cannot be bought on REWE. +
*_Tip:_* The net stock is the quantity of a variation that is available for sale. The net stock is a subset of the physical stock. Substract all reserved quantities from the physical stock and you will get the net stock.

[#500]
== Setting the commission

[TIP]
.Commission settings are optional
====
The settings for the commission for REWE are optional. If you do not set a commission, orders will be imported into plentymarkets with the sales prices that are displayed at REWE. +
If no commission is set, prices will also be displayed without commission on the delivery note.
====

The standard commission is set up in the *Setup » Markets » REWE » Basic settings* menu. The commission serves to calculate the order sums free of commission.

Order sums free of commission are calculated with this formula:

* Sales price REWE = Sales price customer * (1 - conversion factor)
* Conversion factor = Commission * (1 + VAT rate)

For the calculation, the percentages for commission and VAT rate are converted into the corresponding factor, that is, divided by 100. The conversion factor is rounded to 3 decimal places.

[.instruction]
Setting the commission:

. Go to *Setup » Markets » REWE » Basic settings*.
. In the *Commission* area, enter a number for the commission in percent.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings. +
→ The commission is the default commission for all items except for any variations for which a separate commission was set up.

You can set up a separate commission for variations. To do so, use the *REWE commission* variation property. The variation property *REWE commission* is created automatically when the REWE plugin is installed. In order to set up a separate commission for a variation, link the variation to the variation property *REWE commission*.

[.instruction]
Setting up a separate commission for variations:

. Go to *Item » Edit item*.
. Open the item.
. Click on the *Variations* tab.
. Open the variation that you would like to set up a separate commission for.
. Open the variation's *Properties* tab.
. From the *Properties* drop-down list, select *REWE commission*.
. Click on *Add* (icon:plus-square[role="green"]). +
→ The property is linked to the variation.
. Enter a whole number or a decimal number into the *Value* field for the commission in percent.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

[#800]
== Linking the variation property REWE product type

Items that you want to sell on REWE have to be linked with the *REWE product type* variation property. This variation property is created in your plentymarkets system as soon as you have installed the REWE plugin.

[.instruction]
Linking items with the REWE product type variation property:

. Go to *Item » Edit item »* _Open item_ *» Tab: Variation ID » Tab: Properties*.
. In the *Variation properties* area, click on *Add* (icon:plus-square[role="green"]).
. Select the property *REWE product type*.
. Select an appropriate *value* from the drop-down list. +
→ The REWE product types can be selected.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

[#900]
== Setting up the item export

Item data is exported to REWE via catalogues. The assistant *Creating REWE catalogues* helps you to create a catalogue for a specific product category. Is this your first time working with catalogues? Then read up on the basic principle of <<en/data/exporting-data/managing-catalogues, catalogues first>>. For further information about the plentymarkets data fields that can be linked, refer to the <<data/exporting-data/managing-catalogues#_mapping_data_sources, Mapping data fields>> chapter.

At present, the REWE plugin allows you to create catalogues for the following REWE product categories:

* *Household*
* *Multimedia*
* *Drugstore*
* *Fashion*
* *Leisure/sports*
* *Stationary*
* *Toys*
* *Garden*
* *Food*

*_Information for the food product category:_*

* Food specifications must always be made for 100g.
* Energy information must be provided in kcal.
* If the *Nutrition information for prepared and non-prepared foods* field is not mapped, the value *non-prepared* is transferred to REWE by default.

[.collapseBox]
.Step *Mapping basic data fields*
--
In this step of the assistant, you decide which variation data saved in plentymarkets you want to send to the market. To do so, you are going to map each field of the market with the data field in plentymarkets that contains the data that you want to export to the market. Instead of mapping an existing data field, you can also create a new data field for some fields.

'''
*SKU* = From the drop-down list, select the data field in plentymarkets that contains the SKU. +
*_Tip:_* We recommend to link the data field *SKU* with the plentymarkets data field *Variation ID* because the variation ID is clearly assigned to the variation.

'''
*Select data source* = A data field that already exists in plentymarkets will be exported to REWE. Select the data field from the drop-down list *Data source*. +
*_Note:_* The mappings you create will not be checked in terms of logic. As such, check your mappings carefully before starting the export.

'''
*Create property* = Creates a <<item/settings/properties#500, property>> and maps this property to the data field. <<item/settings/properties#500, Properties>> make it possible to export values for data fields that have no corresponding item data saved in plentymarkets, such as *Durchmesser* (diameter).

The automatically created property will be saved in the <<welcome/general-functions/properties#table-create-property, Setup » Settings » Properties » Configuration>> menu.

The property is created with the following settings:

* Section = Item
* Property type = _depending on the market’s requirements_
* Language = German
* Name = Name of the product category
* Group = REWE

'''
*Creating a sales price* = Creates a sales price and maps this sales price to the data field. You can check and edit this sales price in the <<en/item/settings/prices#400, Setup » Item » Sales prices>> menu.

The sales price is created with the following settings:

* Subscription interval = None
* Internal name = REWE
* External name = REWE
* Minimum quantity = 1
* Live conversion = No
* Currency = Euro
* Display = Always display for new items
* Client = ALL
* Class = ALL
* Country = Germany

'''
*Create barcode* = Creates a barcode *REWE* and maps this barcode to the data field. If a barcode with the name *REWE* already exists in the system, that barcode is mapped instead. You can check and edit this barcode in the <<en/item/settings/barcodes#100, Setup » Item » Barcodes>> menu.
--

[#600]
=== Mapping additional data fields in the catalogue (not in assistant)

You have already mapped important mandatory fields for the REWE product category in the assistant. However, after you have completed the assistant, you need to map additional data fields to send more information regarding your products to REWE.

include::_textblocks/instructions/catalogue-assistant-mapping-data-fields.adoc[]

[#602]
=== _Example:_ Mapping the data field "Product description"

An example of how you can link the mandatory field *Produktbeschreibung* (product description) to data saved in plentymarkets is described below.

. Go to *Data » Catalogues*.
. Click on the catalogue. +
→ The catalogue opens.
. Select a plentymarkets data field for the REWE catalogue field *Produktbeschreibung* (product description) from the drop-down list, e.g. *Item text > Name 1, Name 2, Name 3* that should be displayed on REWE as the product description.
. Link the other data fields in the same way. Link at least all mandatory fields.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

[#1000]
== REWE product groups and variants

REWE differentiates between *product groups* and *variants*:

* *Product groups* in plentymarkets are items with variations with at least one REWE group attribute, depending on the product type.
* *Variants* in plentymarkets are variations of an item which do not have more than one REWE variant attribute, depending on the product type.

For REWE group attributes, more than one different attributes can be set, for example colour and motive. For REWE variant attributes, only one variant attribute can be set, for example only size or only volume.

The REWE group attributes and REWE variant attributes for each product type are available in the catalogue templates. Open the drop-down lists *Attribute for variant group* and *Attribute for product group* in the marketplace format to view the available attributes.

Items in plentymarkets can have more than one REWE group attribute. However, only one REWE group attribute can be used to form product groups. Therefore, the *Attribute for product group* field has to be matched so that the first attribute will always be the attribute that you want to use to form a product group. If an item, for example a t-shirt, differs in colour and print and the print should be used as the REWE group attribute, you first have to link the print in the *Attribute for product group* field and the colour only afterwards.

An item should not be linked to more than one attribute which was assigned as REWE variant attribute in the catalogue.

[#1100]
== Matching shipping service providers

Shipping service providers saved in plentymarkets are matched with REWE shipping service providers in the *Setup » Markets » REWE » Shipping service provider matching* menu. If you do not match shipping service providers, then the shipping service provider *unknown* is sent to REWE.

[.instruction]
Matching shipping service providers:

. Go to *Setup » Markets » REWE » Shipping service provider matching*.
. Select the REWE shipping service provider from the drop-down list.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

[#1200]
== Matching reasons for return

Return reasons saved in plentymarkets are matched with REWE return reasons int the *Setup » Markets » REWE » Return reason matching* menu. If you do not match reasons for return, then the reason for return *Other* is sent to REWE. For further information about REWE reasons for return, refer to the seller documentation that you have received from REWE.

[.instruction]
Linking return reasons:

. Go to *Setup » Markets » REWE » Return reason matching*.
. Select the REWE return reason from the drop-down list.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

[#1300]
== Synchronising tax categories

If the tax categories were changed at REWE, you have to synchronise the tax categories in plentymarkets. Tax categories are synchronised with REWE in the *Setup » Markets » REWE » Basic settings* menu in the *Tax categories* area.

[.instruction]
Synchronising tax categories:

. Go to *Setup » Markets » REWE » Basic settings*.
. Go to the *Tax categories* area and click on *Synchronise*. +
→ The tax categories are synchronised with REWE.

*Last update* indicates the last time the tax categories were synchronised with REWE.

[WARNING]
.Synchronise tax categories before switching to REWE live system
====
You need to synchronise the tax categories in plentymarkets before you switch from the REWE stage test environment to the live system. Otherwise, your item catalogue will not be exported. Enter your access data and the product key for the live system prior to switching to the live system. Afterwards, synchronise the tax categories. You have to map the tax categories again in your REWE catalogues after you synchronised them.
====

[#1400]
== Synchronising brands

Brands are automatically synchronised with REWE once per day. Additionally, you can manually synchronise brands with REWE at any time. To do so, open the *Setup » Markets » REWE » Basic settings* menu.
