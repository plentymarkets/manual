You can now upload invoices to real.de automatically in your plentymarkets system. To do so, you set up the event procedure *Upload invoice to real.de*.

Uploading invoices automatically has the following advantages:

* Your customers automatically receive their invoice and are notified by email. This helps you achieve a high level of customer satisfaction.
* You reduce your overhead for customer tickets regarding invoices.
* Your real.de service KPIs will improve.

As such, we recommend that you set up the automatic invoice upload as soon as possible if you have not done so already.

=== Hiding bank details on real.de invoices

The payment is processed via real.de. To prevent customers from paying money directly to you, do not enter bank details on invoices for real.de.

How you hide your bank details on real.de invoices depends on how you show your bank details in the first place.
