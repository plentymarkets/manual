[.instruction]
Setting up the access to real.de:

. Go to *Setup » Markets » real.de » Settings*.
. Open the submenu of the plentyShop that you would like to set up access for.
. Carry out the settings. Pay attention to the explanations given in <<#real-de-settings>>.

.Settings for the market real.de
[cols="1,3a"]
|====
|Setting |Explanation

| *Activate interface to real.de*
a| * *Yes* = Activate the interface to real.de. +

2+| Order settings

| *Book incoming payment*
|This setting applies to the order import. Orders are imported either as paid or not paid. Regardless of this setting, items will immediately be cleared for shipping when they have sufficient stock. With the option *open*, you could also set the order to paid when the actual incoming payment from real.de is received. In this way, real.de can be tested.

| *Match shipping service providers*
|After the shipment has been confirmed, this option allows real.de to use the package number in order to send the customer an email with the correct tracking link. +
*_Important:_* You have to assign each of your service providers to one of the service providers from the drop-down list.

2+| Item settings

| *Activate item export*
|Select whether the item export to real.de should be activated.

| *Export only items with flags*
a| * *All items* = All items are exported.
* *All items with flag 1* or *2* = Only items with this flag are exported. +
* *All items without flag 1* or *2* = Only items without this flag are exported. +
* Select one particular flag = Only items with this flag are exported. +
This setting applies to item data and order data.

| *Item file preview*
|Display the item file preview. +
*_Note:_* If you have not fully set up the interface to real.de but want to take a look at the item file preview, then you have to activate the interface temporarily. Otherwise, the item file preview will be empty. In order to view the item file preview when the interface is not active, activate the interface and click on *Item file preview* (icon:eye[role="blue"]). Deactivate the interface immediately afterwards by selecting the option *No* for the *Activate interface to real.de* setting and saving the setting.

| *Minimum price*
|Select the minimum price, i.e. the lowest price that the item should be offered for. +
A minimum price must be saved for the item for the selected price. The minimum price must be released for the referrer real.de. +
*_Important:_* The minimum price does not apply to item variations which have surcharges for attributes. In this case, *deactivate* this option. If you would like to use the minimum price, then create each variation as a separate item with a defined minimum price.

| *Comments on items*
| Set up *free text fields* for item comments here or assign this function to the *Global item comment* field.

| *Global item comment*

== Activating the order referrer

:market: real.de
:referrer: real.de
:referrer-option: pass:quotes[option *real.de*]

include::../_textblocks/instructions/activate-referrer.adoc[]

[IMPORTANT]
.Do not group real.de orders
====
During the order import, real.de orders are synchronised by the external order number. However, because the external order number does not exist any longer in a grouped order, grouping orders might result in orders being created anew when they are retrieved again.
====

[#300]
== Setting the variation availability

:market-availability: real.de
:option-availability: real.de
:web-api:

include::../_textblocks/instructions/variation-availability.adoc[]

// Web API required!


[#350]
== Saving SKU

:referrer-sku: real.de
:sku-account:
:referrer-id: 102
:sku-client:

include::../_textblocks/instructions/sku-manually.adoc[]

// Marketplace account required!

[#400]
== Defining a sales price

:referrer-price: real.de

include::../_textblocks/instructions/define-sales-price.adoc[]

[#450]
== Defining the barcode

Proceed as described below to define a barcode for the order referrer real.de. This barcode is transferred to real.de for the variation.

[.instruction]
Defining a barcode for real.de:

. Go to *Setup » Item » Barcode*.
. Open the barcode.
. Activate the referrer *real.de*.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

Afterwards, <<item/managing-items#250, link>> the barcode with the desired variations if you have not done so.

== Preparing variations

real.de specifies some mandatory information. That means that a variation only can be exported to the market if this mandatory information is saved for the variation. For a functioning export to real.de, the variation has to conform with the following requirements:

* A *EAN* or an *ISBN*

If the information listed above is not saved, the variation is not exported.

[#500]
== Activating characteristics for the market

:market: real.de
:characteristic-option: real.de

include::../_textblocks/instructions/activate-characteristic.adoc[]

[#550]
=== Linking plentymarkets characteristics with real.de attributes

It is possible to overwrite attributes with plentymarkets characteristics or to add real.de attributes. +
*_Important:_* In order for the plentymarkets characteristics to be correctly assigned during the real.de export, the internal name of the plentymarkets characteristic must be the same as the column header in the real.de Product.csv file. +
The real.de attributes EAN, title, description, manufacturer and picture are mandatory entries for the item export. These attributes are transferred by plentymarkets by default. These attributes can only be overwritten by an attribute. Other attributes, such as "material_composition", "clothing_size" or "weight” can be added if a corresponding characteristic is created in plentymarkets.

[WARNING]
.Mandatory entries for the item export
====
The real.de attributes *ean*, *title*, *description*, *manufacturer* and *picture* are mandatory entries for the item export.
====

[.instruction]
Creating a characteristic:

. Go to *Setup » Item » Characteristics*.
. Click on the *New characteristic* tab.
. Enter the name of the real.de attribute into the *Name (internal)* field. +
→ The entered name is displayed in the item data record when linking characteristics.
. Enter a name in the *Webshop* field.  +
→ This name is used in the item overview of the plentyShop.
. Select the *Characteristic type*.
. Activate the option *real.de*.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

For further information about linking characteristics with real.de, refer to the <<markets/real-de/best-practices-real-linking-characteristics#, Linking characteristics to attributes>> best practice page.

[#600]
== Linking categories

Link your plentymarkets categories to the real.de categories in order to display your items in these categories. Further items from the linked category are assigned automatically.

[.instruction]
Linking categories:

. Go to *Setup » Markets » real.de » Category link*.
. Click on *Search* (icon:search[role="blue"]). +
→ The *Select category* window opens.
. Select the real.de category that best matches your plentymarkets category.
. Click on *Apply*. +
→ The ID and category path of the real.de category are displayed.
. If you already know the ID of the real.de category, enter it directly into the *Market category field* to link it to your plentymarkets category.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

[IMPORTANT]
.Subcategories do not have to be linked
====
In some cases, your subcategories may not match the real.de subcategories. In this case, link your items with real.de's corresponding main category. real.de automatically assigns your items to a subcategory. You should not transfer items to real.de that have not been assigned to a real.de category.
====

[#800]
== Activating the payment method

:payment-method: real.de Payment
:folder: DE

[#870]
=== Hiding bank details on real.de invoices

The payment is processed via real.de. To prevent customers from paying money directly to you, do not enter bank details on invoices for real.de. +

If you use a <<orders/order-documents#1700, PDF template>> to display your bank details on an invoice, then create another PDF template for real.de that does not contain bank details. You can also save the real.de logo for this PDF template. To save this PDF template for the payment method *real.de Payment*, go to *Setup » Client » Standard » Locations » Germany (standard) » Documents » Invoice » Tab: PDF template*. Your bank details are not displayed on invoices for real.de.
