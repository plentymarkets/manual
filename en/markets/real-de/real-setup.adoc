|This setting applies to the order import. Orders are imported either as paid or not paid. Regardless of this setting, items will immediately be cleared for shipping when they have sufficient stock. With the setting *open*, one could also set the order to paid when the actual incoming payment from real.de is received. In this way, real.de can be tested.

| *Match shipping service providers*
|After the shipment has been confirmed, this option allows real.de to use the package number in order to send the customer an email with the correct tracking link. +
*Important:* You have to assign each of your service providers to one of the service providers from the drop-down list.

2+| Item settings

Deactivate the interface immediately afterwards by selecting *No* for the *Activate interface to real.de* setting and saving the settings.

A minimum price must be saved for the item for the selected price. The minimum price must be released for the referrer real.de. +
*Important:* The minimum price does not apply to item variations which have surcharges for attributes. In this case, *deactivate* this setting. If you would like to use the minimum price, then create each variation as a separate item with a defined minimum price.

| *Comments on items*
| Set up *free text fields* for item comments here or assign this function to the *Global item comment* field.

*Important:* In order for the plentymarkets characteristics to be correctly assigned during the real.de export, the internal name of the plentymarkets characteristic must be the same as the column header in the real.de Product.csv file. +
The real.de attributes EAN, title, description, manufacturer and picture are mandatory entries for the item export. These attributes are transferred by plentymarkets by default.
