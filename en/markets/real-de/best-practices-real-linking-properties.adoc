In order to list items on real.de successfully, plentymarkets transfers two files. One file contains the product data (product.csv) and the other file contains the offer data (inventory.csv). The product.csv is used to list the item. The inventory.csv is used to create the offer. Therefore, this file only contains information about price, stock, and shipping.

== How do I link a property to a real.de attribute?

For various reasons, it might be useful to add specific attributes to the product data file. One reason is to provide the buyer with additional information about the item (material, colour etc.). Another reason is to transfer mandatory information which is required by law for specific products (danger notices, nutrition declarations etc.).

You can add this information by adding properties to the product data file. A new column is added to the product.csv for each property that is linked to link:https://www.real.de/[real.de^]. +
*Note*: This procedure only works for the product.csv, but not for the inventory.csv.

== How do I add an attribute to the product.csv?

First of all, you have to find out the exact name of the column in the product data file. An overview of the attributes is provided on link:https://www.real.de/versandpartner/download-bereich/[real.de^].

For example, if you want to add the attribute "material composition" to the file, the corresponding property must be named "material_composition".
Create the new property in plentymarkets in the *System » System settings » Item » Properties* menu. The new property will then appear in the CSV file. The property must have the exact same name as the corresponding real.de attribute. In addition, you have to link the property to real.de.

[[attributename]]
.real attribute name

[[marketplacelink]]
.link to real
image::markets/assets/bp-real-marketlink.png[]

Add the property to the item and enter the corresponding value. The information will then be displayed in the file.

[[itemlink]]
.Linking the property to the item

A new column is added to the product.csv afterwards.

*Note*: If two properties have the same name, then the property with the lower ID will be overwritten. This way you can overwrite attributes which already exist by default (EAN, name etc.).
