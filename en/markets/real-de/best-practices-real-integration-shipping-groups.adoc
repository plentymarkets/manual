== Which shipping profile is matched?

If an item is linked to several shipping profiles with different shipping groups, then the shipping group of the shipping profile with the lowest category and the highest priority is assigned.
The category and the priority of the shipping profile are set up in the *System » System settings » Orders » Shipping » Settings » Tab: Shipping profiles* menu in the *Base* tab of each shipping profile.

== How to set up shipping profiles

If you only have a few shipping profiles and a simple structure, you do not need to carry out any particular settings.
If you have to reproduce a complex structure with the shipping profiles, then you should create separate shipping profiles for the snychronisation of the shipping groups. Those shipping profiles should only be released for real.de. Additionally, you should not release any other shipping profiles for real.de. This may initially be a lot of work, but you will have a clear structure which facilitates any further tasks afterwards.
Use the data format *ItemParcelServicePreset* to add the shipping profiles to your items afterwards. To use the data format *ItemParcelServicePreset*, the link:https://marketplace.plentymarkets.com/en/plugins/integration/ElasticExportShippingProfiles_4747[plentymarkets shipping profiles^] plugin must be installed. The data format *ItemParcelServicePreset* is available in the *Data » Custom export* menu.
