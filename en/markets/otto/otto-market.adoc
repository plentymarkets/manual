[#500]
== Setting up event procedures

Set up <<automation/event-procedures#, event procedures>> to automatically inform OTTO Market about order status changes. The following event procedures can be set up for OTTO Market:

* Versandinformation an OTTO melden (Send shipping confirmation to OTTO)
* Auftragsstornierung an OTTO melden (Send order cancellation to OTTO)
* Retoure an OTTO melden (Send return to OTTO)
* Ablehnung der Retoure an OTTO melden (Send rejection of return to OTTO)

How to set up the event procedures in plentymarkets is described in the following chapters.

[IMPORTANT]
.Sequence of event procedures
====
Note that event procedures for OTTO market must be triggered in a specific sequence. First, the event procedure <<Generating return labels, Generate return label>> must be triggered and afterwards the event procedure <<Sending shipping confirmations to OTTO, Send shipping confirmation to OTTO>>. If no return label was created, the shipping confirmation cannot be sent to OTTO Market.
====

[#550]
=== Generating return labels

When OTTO Market orders are imported into your plentymarkets system, return labels must be generated for those orders before the shipping confirmation is sent to OTTO Market. An event procedure for creating a return label automatically creates a tracking number for a return (retTrackingNumber) which is saved for the order. This is to ensure that a tracking number exists if customers wish to return an item. +

To ensure that the tracking number is sent to OTTO Market along with the order confirmation, you have to create a return label. Return labels can be created with the shipping service provider plugins link:https://marketplace.plentymarkets.com/en/plugins/integration/dhlretoureonline_6714[DHL Retoure Online^], link:https://marketplace.plentymarkets.com/en/plugins/integration/glsshipping_6463[GLS Shipping^], and link:https://marketplace.plentymarkets.com/en/plugins/integration/hermesshippinginterface_5437[Hermes^].

*Note:* At the moment, return labels can be created with DHL, Hermes, and GLS Shipping.

[IMPORTANT]
.Install plugins
====
In order to generate return labels, the plugins *DHL Retoure Online*, *Hermes*, or *GLS Shipping* must be installed, activated and set up in your plentymarkets system, depending on which shipping service provider you want to use. You can download the plugins in the link:https://marketplace.plentymarkets.com/en/plugins/fulfillment-stock/shipping[plentyMarketplace^]{nbsp}icon:external-link[].
====

How to set up an <<automation/event-procedures#, event procedure>> to create a DHL return label is described below.

In order to create a return label with GLS Shipping, select the procedure *Plugins > GLSShipping: Register return label* instead. For further information, refer to the GLS Shipping plugin link:https://marketplace.plentymarkets.com/en/plugins/integration/glsshipping_6463[user guide^].

With Hermes, return labels cannot be created via event procedures. Before the shipping label for OTTO Market is created, the return label for Hermes must be created via the <<fulfilment/shipping-centre#, shipping centre>> or via a <<automation/processes/procedures#, procedure>> in a process. For further information, refer to the Hermes plugin link:https://marketplace.plentymarkets.com/en/plugins/integration/hermesshippinginterface_5437[user guide^].

[#1050]
== OTTO Market order management

This chapter informs you how orders are processed at OTTO Market.

[#1100]
=== Order import

OTTO Market orders are imported into plentymarkets with status *[3] Waiting for payment*. After an order was confirmed by OTTO Market, it changes to status *[5] Shipment process started*. A payment is created for the order in plentymarkets and the order is marked as *paid*. If customers paid an OTTO Market order per bank transfer, it might take longer to confirm the order than for other payment methods. In plentymarkets, the payment method is always *OTTO Payment*. +

If customers do not pay for an order, the order will be cancelled by OTTO Market after some time. A cancellation will be sent to plentymarkets. In plentymarkets, the unpaid order automatically changes to status *[8] Cancelled*.

[#1200]
=== Invoice import

Invoices for OTTO Market orders are generated by OTTO Market and automatically imported into plentymarkets after you sent a shipping confirmation to OTTO Market. Shipping confirmations are sent with the event procedure <<Sending shipping confirmations to OTTO Market, Send shipping confirmation to OTTO>>. The invoice documents can be accessed in the *Receipts* tab of the main order after the shipping confirmation was sent. This means that you cannot create invoices for OTTO Market in plentymarkets. +

OTTO Market creates invoices as soon as an item was shipped. Therefore, invoices are also created for partial deliveries.


[#1300]
== FAQ

[qanda]

Which product title is shown at OTTO Market?::
The product title which is displayed on OTTO Market is composed of the following OTTO Market fields that can be mapped in the catalogue: *Brand* + *Model* + *Specific characteristics* \+ all fields that have the information *Namenbildend* indicated in parentheses.

Why aren't my items being exported to OTTO Market?::
You can find out why some of your items are not exported to OTTO Market and therefore are not available on the online market by looking at the following logs.
+
[.instruction]
. In the *Log*, enter *Otto itemexport* into the *Integration* drop-down list and select *Plenty\\Modules\\Otto\\Item\\Services\\ItemExportService*.
. In the *Level* drop-down list, enter both *warning* and *error* one after the other.
. Open the logs containing the message *Variation invalid*. +
→ In the log, you will receive the variation ID and the reason for the rejection or the missing characteristic. +
→ This example shows variation ID 30170 and the missing productDescription.brand. This means that the manufacturer or the brand is missing.
. Next, search for the variation listed in the *log* to make sure that you will find the correct item. +
→ The manufacturer can be found in the *Global* tab of a variation.
. In the *Audio » Radios* catalogue, the brand *AudioAffairs* is not mapped. This leads to the item being rejected and causes the error message.
. Click on *Add brand* (icon:plus-square[role="green"]) to add the brand *AudioAffairs*.

How can I assign a return package to the correct order in my plentymarkets system?::
An example of a DHL return label is provided below. The label contains all necessary data.
+
[[dhl-return-label]].
.DHL return label
image::markets/otto/assets/dhl-return-label.png[DHL return label]

How do I find orders in my plentymarkets system?::
As this question frequently arises in the plentymarkets forum, a short explanation is provided below.
+
The *PositionID* (example: 715e9369-01e3-4d09-ae91-8688dfa139b2) and the *SalesOrderID* (example: 4245eac7-4647-4f76-8c48-261afb19aa96) are frequently mentioned in the plentymarkets forum. However, these IDs are not relevant for you as seller. You cannot see these IDs. They serve to identify an order and the order positions in the plentymarkets database.
+
Orders with the order referrer *OTTO Market* receive the usual order ID from your plentymarkets system. However, to identify the order, an external order number is saved for the order. With this number, the order can be clearly assigned.
+
Screenshots illustrating how OTTO Market orders are created in plentymarkets and in the *Mein Konto* (My account) area at OTTO Market are provided below.
+
[[otto-market-order-number]]
."Mein Konto” (My account) area at OTTO Market
image::markets/otto/assets/otto-market_order-number.png[OTTO market order number]
+
The order number is saved as external order number at the order in plentymarkets.
+
Find a screenshot of the menu for searching the order with the external order number below:
+
[[otto-market-external-order-number]]
.Searching for the external order number
image::markets/otto/assets/otto-market_search_external-order-number.png[Search external order number]
+
The external order number can be found in the *Settings* tab of an order (*Ext. order number*).
+
If customers have further questions concerning an order, you can find an order by searching for the external order number.
+
Additionally, you can use the *Referrer* filter to filter OTTO Market orders.

The log shows an error. How can I solve this error?::
+
* *Duplicate entry. Combination of the fields variationId, marketId and accountId must be unique.*
+
This error is also indicated as “SKU 1234 not generated” in the log.
+
How SKUs should be generated is defined in the catalogue. There is a distinction between the *Parent SKU* and the *Variation SKU*. The source selected here should be a data record which exists only once. Hence, it is not possible to use the same SKU for different items. For example, you could use the *Item ID* and the *Variation ID*. Both IDs are generated when the item is created in plentymarkets and only exist once. However, it might happen that the item export is carried out with errors because of missing information in the catalogue. The SKU is created anyway and can now be found in the *Availability* tab of a variation. During the next export, your plentymarkets system will try again to create an SKU from the sources selected in the catalogue. However, as this SKU already exists, the error “Duplicate entry. Combination of the fields variationId, marketId and accountId must be unique." / “SKU 1234 not generated.” occurs.
+
Therefore it is necessary to add a fallback solution in the catalogue. The solution looks like this:
+
[[add-source]]
.Add source
image::markets/otto/assets/otto-market_add_source.png[Add source]
+
[IMPORTANT]
.Add source
====
When adding another source, it is mandatory to use the *Add source* button (icon:link[role="yellow"]) on the right-hand side of the catalogue. Do _not_ use the *+ Additional source* button (icon:plus-square[role="green"]) because in this case, your SKUs would be created twice and the error could not be solved.
====
+
A second source is added. During the next export, the first source will be retrieved first. As the SKU is already included in this source, the second source will be ignored. If the first source does not contain an SKU, then a new SKU will be generated using the second source.
+
* *Code: 200009 - ATTRIBUTE_CHANGE_DENIED* or *title: Der Wert dieses Feldes kann nicht geändert werden.* (title: The value of this field cannot be changed.)
+
These errors indicate that you changed an OTTO item attribute. However, OTTO does not accept the change and it is not possible the change the attribute for this item. The indicated attribute can relate to a variation attribute or a title attribute. Other OTTO attributes are important here, too.
+
[TIP]
.Items cannot be deleted at OTTO Market
====
An item _cannot be deleted_ at OTTO Market, neither by plentymarkets nor by OTTO. It is only possible to mark the item as *not available* at OTTO Market. Therefore, you should always make sure that the correct sources are mapped in the catalogue prior to transferring your items.
====
+
* *productDescription.brand*
+
This error indicates that the variation’s brand that should be exported has not been mapped in the catalogue. The brand can be linked to the variation in two different ways:
+
* via the *Manufacturer* setting in an item’s *Global* tab
* via property
+
Make sure that a source is saved for the brand in the catalogue and that the source is linked to the item.
+
* *mediaAssets.IMAGE*
+
This error indicates that either you did not select an image source in the catalogue or that none of your item images is linked to the referrer *OTTO Market*. To do so, open an item’s *Images* tab and activate the referrer *OTTO market* as described in the <<Setting the availability for images, Setting the availability for images>> chapter.
+
* *delivery.type*
+
This error indicates that the shipping method is not linked. The shipping method can be defined via two different sources:
+
* via a shipping profile
* via property
+
Make sure that the source saved in the catalogue is linked to the item. For the shipping profile, activate the shipping profile in the item’s *Global* tab. For the property, activate the property for the desired variation.
+
* *productDescription.category*
+
This error indicates that the category link in the catalogue is missing. In the catalogue, check whether at least one category of the desired variation is linked to an OTTO Market category.
+
* Error messages concerning order processing: *Carrier ID (X) not mapped in OTTO market config.*
+
Check whether shipping service providers were linked to OTTO Market. This is done in the *Shipping service provider* step of the *OTTO Market Basic settings* assistant in the *Setup » Assistants » Omni-Channel* menu.
