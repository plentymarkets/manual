Setting up an event procedure: Generate DHL return label

When OTTO market orders are imported into your plentymarkets system, then DHL return labels must be generated for those orders before the orders are confirmed. The event procedure *Generate DHL return label* automatically creates a tracking number for a return (retTrackingNumber) which is saved for the order. This is to ensure that a tracking number exists if customers wish to return an item. +

*Note:* At the moment, the return label can only be generated with DHL. Further shipping service providers will be available soon.

[TIP]
.Save DHL access data
====
In order to generate a DHL return label, you need to have finished setting up *DHL Retoure Online* in the *Setup » Orders » Shipping » Shipping Service Provider » DHL Retoure Online* menu. Among other things, you need to have saved your DHL access data consisting of user name and password.
