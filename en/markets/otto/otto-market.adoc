This page provides information about OTTO market, OTTO's marketplace model.

[#100]
== OTTO Market

OTTO market is OTTO's marketplace. You are shown as the seller of your products. However, communication with customers is managed by OTTO. +

Connecting to this market allows for the following automatic processes to take place:

* Order import once an hour
* Stock synchronisation every 15 minutes +
*_Note:_* If stock for a variation drops to 0, this variation is deactivated automatically after 15 days. This is done to protect the product’s ranking on OTTO Market. If new stock is booked for such a variation, the variation is reactivated during the nightly item export.
* Update of item data including price synchronisation once every night
* Import of return announcements by customers once per hour
* Update of category groups/catalogue templates twice a week
* Update of the brands list every three hours

[#200]
== Setting up an account

Use the assistant *Base settings - OTTO Market* in the *Setup » Assistants » Omni-Channel* menu to quickly and conveniently set up OTTO Market in plentymarkets. Moreover, you set up the data transfer to OTTO Market. Keep the API access data at hand that you received from OTTO Market.

|Setting |Explanation

2+|Step *Settings*

| *Select the client that should be used to sell your items.*
a| From the drop-down list *Client*, select a client. This client is used to generate the item URL in the catalogue and OTTO Market orders are assigned to this client.

| *Would you like to activate your OTTO market user account?*
a| _Not activated_ = The settings are saved but the data exchange with OTTO Market is not started. +
_Activated_ = Data exchange with OTTO Market is started once the assistant is completed. +
*_Recommendation:_* Check all settings before activating the user account.

2+|Step *API access data*

| *Enter the API access data.*
a| * *API user* (mandatory input) = Enter the user name for the API interface that you received from OTTO Market.
* *Password* (mandatory input) = Enter the password for the API interface that you received from OTTO Market.

2+|Step *Data exchange*

| Activate to automatically import orders once an hour. +
*_Note:_* You need to activate this option to export item data and stock information.

| *Which data would you like to transfer to OTTO market?* +
(only shown if you activated *Import orders*)
a| Select the data to be exported. +
*_Note:_* You need to automatically import orders to export item data and stock information.

* *Item data* = Item data is synchronised once a day during the night.
* *Stock information* = Stock is synchronised every 15 minutes. +
*_Note:_* If stock for a variation drops to 0, this variation is deactivated automatically after 15 days. This is done to protect the product’s ranking on OTTO Market. If new stock is booked for such a variation, the variation is reactivated during the nightly item export.

| *Would you like to import return announcements from OTTO market into plentymarkets?*
| Activate to import returns that customers create on OTTO Market once per hour. Each returned order item is shown as a separate return in the *Orders* tab of an order.

| *Select the order status for newly imported return announcements.* +
(only shown if you activated *Import return announcements*)
| From the drop-down list, select the status to be assigned to return announcements during import. +
*_Note:_* A return announcement does not guarantee that the customer actually sends the product back to you. As such, select a status that does not trigger any unwanted event procedures, such as event procedures for creating credit notes.

| *Would you like to replace the stock amount for variations with no stock limitation?*
a| Activate *Replace stock* to enter a stock amount.

| *Stock amount* +
(only shown if you activated *Limit stock*)
| Enter the stock amount. This stock amount is sent if the setting *Limit* of a variation is set to *None* or *Do not administer stock for this variation* and stock is less than or equal to 0.

| *Would you like to import purchase receipts as external invoices?*
a| Since since 15/12/2020, purchase receipts are imported as normal order documentsby default. Up to that date, the order documents provided by OTTO Market were imported with the document type *External invoice* even though the documents were not proper invoices. If you want to continue to import these documents with the document type *External invoices* due to dependencies to other exports, interfaces or software, activate the option *Import purchase receipts as external invoices*. Visit the link:https://forum.plentymarkets.com/t/aenderung-des-dokumententyps-der-kaufbelege-von-otto-change-of-document-type-of-purchase-receipts-from-otto/619731[plentymarkets forum^]{nbsp}icon:external-link[] for more details.

For example, return tracking numbers are added via REST API if you work with an external fulfilment company that is connected via this API. For return tracking numbers that are added via REST API, the assignments for *OTTO Market shipping service provider for returns* cannot be applied. +
*_Note:_* No return shipping service providers are shown in the drop-down list? Then install at least one plugin for shipping service providers. You can download the plugins from the link:https://marketplace.plentymarkets.com/en/plugins/fulfillment-stock/shipping[plentyMarketplace^]{nbsp}icon:external-link[].

* *Use service provider from shipping profile* (Default option) = The shipping service provider of the order’s shipping profile is also used as the shipping service provider for the return.

== Setting up the item export

Item data is exported to OTTO Market via catalogues. Use the assistant *Create catalogues - OTTO Market* to create a marketplace format for every OTTO category group. Is this your first time working with catalogues? Then read up on the <<en/data/exporting-data/managing-catalogues, principle of catalogues first>>. For further information about the plentymarkets data sources that can be linked, refer to the <<data/exporting-data/managing-catalogues#_mapping_data_sources, Mapping data fields>> chapter.

[IMPORTANT]
.Items cannot be deleted at OTTO Market
====
An item cannot be deleted at OTTO Market, neither by plentymarkets nor by OTTO. It is only possible to mark the item as *not available* at OTTO Market. Therefore, make extra sure that the correct data fields are mapped in the catalogue prior to transferring your items.
====

=== Creating a catalogue in the assistant

:catalogue-assistant-name: Create catalogues - OTTO Market
:number-of-boxes: info boxes
:catalogue-path: pass:quotes[*Setup » Assistants » Omni-Channel*]
:catalogue-note: You need a separate catalogue for each OTTO category group.
:mapping-fields: more

include::../_textblocks/instructions/catalogue-assistant-config.adoc[]

[.collapseBox]
.Step *Name and category group*
--
[[table-otto-market-catalogue-assistant]]
[width="100%"]
[cols="1,2a"]
|====
| Setting | Explanation

| *Enter a name for the catalogue.*
a| Enter a name for the catalogue.

| *Select the OTTO category group that should be added to the catalogue.*
| Select an OTTO category group from the drop-down list. +
*_Note:_* You need a separate catalogue for each OTTO category group.
|====
--

[.collapseBox]
.Step *Required fields*
--
In this step of the assistant, you decide which variation data saved in plentymarkets you want to send to the market. To do so, you are going to map each mandatory field of the market with the data field in plentymarkets that contains the data that you want to export to the market. Each market specifies their own mandatory fields. Instead of mapping an existing data field, you can also create a new data field for some fields.

'''
*Parent SKU* = From the drop-down list, select the data field in plentymarkets that contains the parent SKU.

'''
*SKU* = From the drop-down list, select the data field in plentymarkets that contains the SKU.

'''
*Select data source* = A data field that already exists in plentymarkets will be exported to OTTO Market. Select the data field from the drop-down list *Data field*. +
*_Note:_* The mappings you create will not be checked in terms of logic. As such, check your mappings carefully before starting the export.

'''
*Create property* = Creates a property and maps this property to the data field. This automatically created property will be saved in the <<item/settings/properties#, Setup » Settings » Properties » Configuration>> menu.

The property is created with the following settings:

* Section = Item
* Property type = _depending on the market’s requirements_
* Language = German
* Name = Field of the OTTO category group
* Group = OTTO Market

'''
*Creating a sales price* = Creates a sales price and maps this sales price to the data field. You can check and edit this sales price in the <<en/item/settings/prices#400, Setup » Item » Sales prices>> menu.

The sales price is created with the following settings:

* Subscription interval = None
* Internal name = OTTO Market
* External name = OTTO Market
* Minimum quantity = 1
* Live conversion = No
* Currency = Euro
* Display = Always display for new items
* Client = ALL
* Class = ALL
* Country = Germany

'''
*Create barcode* = Creates the barcode *OTTO Market* and maps this barcode with the data field. If a barcode with the name *OTTO Market* already exists in the system, that barcode is mapped instead. You can check and edit this barcode in the <<en/item/settings/barcodes#100, Setup » Item » Barcodes>> menu.
--

[#600]
=== Mapping additional data fields in the catalogue (not in assistant)

You have already mapped important mandatory fields for the OTTO category group in the assistant. However, after you have completed the assistant, you need to map additional data fields to send more information regarding your products to OTTO Market.

TIP: Map at least the data fields *Brand*, *Delivery type* and *Category* with plentymarkets data fields.

:catalogue-assistant:
include::../_textblocks/instructions/catalogue-map-data-fields.adoc[]

[#602]
=== _Example:_ Mapping the data field "Stock"

An example of how to map the data field *Stock* to item data saved in plentymarkets is provided below. Use the data field *Stock* to select from which warehouse stock is to be exported to OTTO Market.

[.instruction]
Mapping the data field "Stock":

. Go to *Data » Catalogues*.
. Click on the catalogue. +
→ The catalogue opens.
. Navigate to the OTTO Market data field *Stock*.
. Click on *Add data field*.
. In the list that opens to the left, click on the folder *Stock*. +
→ All warehouses saved in plentymarkets are displayed in the drop-down list.
. Click on the plus symbol for the warehouse from which you want to export the stock to OTTO Market. +
*_Optional:_* To transfer stock from multiple warehouses to OTTO Market, click on *Add fallback data field* (icon:link[role="yellow"]) and add another warehouse. +
→ The total stock of all selected warehouses is exported. +
*_Note:_* If you do not map the data field *Stock* to a warehouse, then the sum of the net stock of all distribution warehouses (data field *Virtual warehouse*) will be exported to OTTO Market.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

[#701]
== Linking data fields created in the assistant with variations

:property-group: OTTO Market

include::../_textblocks/instructions/assistant-link-sources.adoc[]

[#475]
== Linking variations with OTTO category groups

After you created a marketplace format for OTTO Market with the *OTTO Market Creating catalogues* assistant or manually, the property *OTTO category group* is created in your plentymarkets system. A new selection value is added to the *OTTO category group* property for each OTTO category group selected in the *Name and category group* step of the assistant. In order for your variations to be exported in the appropriate catalogue, they have to be linked to the *OTTO category group* property in the *Properties* tab of a variation.

[.instruction]
Linking a variation with an OTTO category group:

. Go to *Item » Edit item » [Open item]*.
. Click on the *Variations* tab.
. Open the variation that should be linked.
. Open the *Properties* tab.
. In the *Variation properties* area, select the property *OTTO category group* from the *Properties* drop-down list and click on *Add* (icon:plus-square[role="green"]). +
→ The property is added.
. Select the desired category group from the *Value* drop-down list for the *OTTO category group* property. +
*_Note:_* The export to OTTO Market contains the name of the catalogue, not the name of the marketplace format. +
→ The variation will be exported in this catalogue. +
*_Example:_* If you select the value *Betten* (Beds), then the variation will be exported in the catalogue for the OTTO category group *Betten*.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

[#500]
== Setting up event procedures

Set up <<automation/event-procedures#, event procedures>> to automatically inform OTTO Market about order status changes. The following event procedures can be set up for OTTO Market:

* Versandinformation an OTTO melden (Send shipping confirmation to OTTO)
* Auftragsstornierung an OTTO melden (Send order cancellation to OTTO)
* Retoure an OTTO melden (Send return to OTTO)
* Ablehnung der Retoure an OTTO melden (Send rejection of return to OTTO)

How to set up the event procedures in plentymarkets is described in the following chapters.

[IMPORTANT]
.Sequence of event procedures
====
Note that event procedures for OTTO market must be triggered in a specific sequence. First, the event procedure <<Generating return labels, Generate return label>> must be triggered and afterwards the event procedure <<Sending shipping confirmations to OTTO, Send shipping confirmation to OTTO>>. If no return label was created, the shipping confirmation cannot be sent to OTTO Market.
====

[#550]
=== Generating return labels

When OTTO Market orders are imported into your plentymarkets system, return labels must be generated for those orders before the shipping confirmation is sent to OTTO Market. An event procedure for creating a return label automatically creates a tracking number for a return (retTrackingNumber) which is saved for the order. This is to ensure that a tracking number exists if customers wish to return an item. +

To ensure that the tracking number is sent to OTTO Market along with the order confirmation, you have to create a return label. Return labels can be created with the shipping service provider plugins link:https://marketplace.plentymarkets.com/en/plugins/integration/dhlretoureonline_6714[DHL Retoure Online^], link:https://marketplace.plentymarkets.com/en/plugins/integration/glsshipping_6463[GLS Shipping^], and link:https://marketplace.plentymarkets.com/en/plugins/integration/hermesshippinginterface_5437[Hermes^].

*_Note:_* At the moment, return labels can be created with DHL, Hermes, and GLS Shipping.

[IMPORTANT]
.Install plugins
====
In order to generate return labels, the plugins *DHL Retoure Online*, *Hermes*, or *GLS Shipping* must be installed, activated and set up in your plentymarkets system, depending on which shipping service provider you want to use. You can download the plugins in the link:https://marketplace.plentymarkets.com/en/plugins/fulfillment-stock/shipping[plentyMarketplace^]{nbsp}icon:external-link[].
====

How to set up an <<automation/event-procedures#, event procedure>> to create a DHL return label is described below.

In order to create a return label with GLS Shipping, select the procedure *Plugins > GLSShipping: Register return label* instead. For further information, refer to the GLS Shipping plugin link:https://marketplace.plentymarkets.com/en/plugins/integration/glsshipping_6463[user guide^].

With Hermes, return labels cannot be created via event procedures. Before the shipping label for OTTO Market is created, the return label for Hermes must be created via the <<fulfilment/shipping-centre#, shipping centre>> or via a <<automation/processes/procedures#, procedure>> in a process. For further information, refer to the Hermes plugin link:https://marketplace.plentymarkets.com/en/plugins/integration/hermesshippinginterface_5437[user guide^].

=== Sending shipping confirmations to OTTO

Set up an <<automation/event-procedures#, event procedure>> to inform OTTO Market that an item has been shipped.

[TIP]
.Save sender address
====
Shipping confirmations will only be sent to OTTO Market if the seller’s sender address was saved. You can save the address in the settings of a warehouse under *Setup » Stock » Warehouse » [Select warehouse] » Settings*. You have to save the address for the warehouse that is used in the respective order.

[#1050]
== OTTO Market order management

This chapter informs you how orders are processed at OTTO Market.

[#1100]
=== Order import

OTTO Market orders are imported into plentymarkets with status *[3] Waiting for payment*. After an order was confirmed by OTTO Market, the order changes to status *[5] Shipment process started*. A payment is created for the order in plentymarkets and the order is marked as *paid*. If customers paid an OTTO Market order per bank transfer, it might take longer to confirm the order than for other payment methods. In plentymarkets, the payment method is always *OTTO Payment*. +

If customers do not pay for an order, the order will be cancelled by OTTO Market after some time. A cancellation will be sent to plentymarkets. In plentymarkets, the unpaid order automatically changes to status *[8] Cancelled*.

[#1200]
=== Invoice import

Invoices for OTTO Market orders are generated by OTTO Market and automatically imported into plentymarkets after you sent a shipping confirmation to OTTO Market. Shipping confirmations are sent with the event procedure <<Sending shipping confirmations to OTTO Market, Send shipping confirmation to OTTO>>. The invoice documents can be accessed in the *Receipts* tab of the main order after the shipping confirmation was sent. This means that you cannot create invoices for OTTO Market in plentymarkets. +

OTTO Market creates invoices as soon as an item was shipped. Therefore, invoices are also created for partial deliveries.

[#1400]
=== Credit note import

Credit notes and partial credit notes for OTTO Market orders are generated by OTTO Market and automatically imported into plentymarkets after you sent a returns confirmation to OTTO Market. Once the return has been confirmed, the credit note documents are available in the *Receipts* tab of the order. This returns confirmation is sent with the event procedure *Send return to OTTO*. When you notify OTTO of a return, the components of the individual order items of the refund/return are sent to OTTO. This means that OTTO will refund the complete sales price of any order item. You cannot notify OTTO Market of a partial refund for a particular order item. As such, even if you adjust the price of an order item, this does not affect the refund document that OTTO creates.

Because OTTO Markets creates credit notes when the return of an item is confirmed, credit notes are also generated for partial returns.
