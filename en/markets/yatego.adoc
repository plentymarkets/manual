== FAQ

===== How does plentymarkets transmit items that are not limited to stock to Yatego?

[.indented]
Items that are set to *No limitation* are transferred to Yatego. This setting is found by opening an item and clicking on *Tab: Stock » Tab: Settings*. The setting is found in the *Limitation* line. plentymarkets sends a value of -1 for these items, so that Yatego knows that these items can be bought without limitation.

===== Can I manually import orders from Yatego to plentymarkets?

[.indented]
Yes. If a Yatego order is manually transferred to plentymarkets from Yatego, then Yatego does not send an item ID or variation ID (attribute_value_set_id). This makes it impossible for the item to be assigned and the item is imported with the item ID -2 (unknown item). Unassigned items are flagged by a *green plus icon* in the order. The item then has to be assigned manually.

===== How do I know that the purchaser has already paid the order?

[.indented]
Yatego neither sends a transaction ID for payments nor other information that indicates whether the order was paid for or not. Therefore, the Yatego settings include an option that allows you to set orders to be booked for some payment methods: *Set all orders in status 5 to booked*. Select this option if the payment method ensures that payment was already made when the order is booked.

===== The link for the item in the order does not work. What can I do?

[.indented]
Yatego sends a link for the orders, which directly connects to the item on the Yatego platform. Usually, this link doesn't work, since Yatego adds "yatego.com" to the name of the online store. Delete "yatego.com" from the link and then it will work correctly. +
*Example:* http://www.yatego.com/SHOPNAME.yatego.com/p,4fcaaf8c8292c,461e2919becf22_4 +
*The correct format is:* http://www.yatego.com/SHOPNAME/p,4fcaaf8c8292c,461e2919becf22_4

===== I set up Yatego in plentymarkets. Why are my orders not transferred?

[.indented]
The first time that an online store activates the Yatego order process for plentymarkets, it is common that the first two to three orders will not be automatically transferred to plentymarkets. These orders have to be manually triggered again from within the Yatego system.

===== I would like to offer an item with attributes. Why does Yatego not display the stock correctly?

[.indented]
Yatego is not able to process the warehouse data records that plentymarkets sends for items if there are more than 999 possible combinations of attributes. As such, all possible combinations of variations are activated for the item and set to endless stock (meaning that stock doesn't exist for Yatego). If you need to use a large number of attributes, contact Yatego before exporting the corresponding items.

===== Why does Yatego not immediately edit the CSV files I transferred?

[.indented]
The CSV files that are transferred to Yatego each day are not imported and edited immediately, but rather have to wait in line to be processed. Therefore, the import and editing process can take several hours. You can go to Yatego and check where your file is in line.
