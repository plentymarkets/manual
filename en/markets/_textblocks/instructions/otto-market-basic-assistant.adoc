* *Stock information* = Stock is synchronised every 15 minutes. +
*_Note:_* If stock for a variation drops to 0, this variation is deactivated automatically after 15 days. This is done to protect the product’s ranking on OTTO Market. If new stock is booked for such a variation, the variation is reactivated during the nightly item export.
