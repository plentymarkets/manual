5+| Category

| Category
| yes
| *Category*
| Only one category is exported per product. However, due to technical reasons, the default category of a variation cannot be determined during the export. If more than one category is linked to a main variation, a check is run to determine which of these categories is mapped to a limango data field in the catalogue. If more than one category is mapped in the catalogue, the first mapped category in the catalogueâ€™s category list is exported. If you want to export a different category, change the order of the mappings in the catalogue.
