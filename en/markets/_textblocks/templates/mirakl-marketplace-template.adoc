== Setting up the item export

Item data is exported to {marketplace} via catalogue templates. Go to *Data » Catalogs* to create catalogues. Is this your first time working with catalogues? Then read up on the basic principle of <<en/data/exporting-data/managing-catalogues, catalogues first>>.

If you want to sell your products in multiple {marketplace} product categories, create a separate catalogue for each of them. Link the {marketplace} data fields with item data saved in plentymarkets in the catalogue template afterwards. Once you’ve activated a catalogue, plentymarkets automatically exports the catalogue templates to {marketplace} daily.

[IMPORTANT]
.Error log
====
If there’s a problem during export, you can find the related log entries on Mirakl and not the plentymarkets log.

== Linking variations to a {marketplace} catalogue category

After you created a marketplace format for {marketplace} with the *{marketplace}* assistant or manually, the property *{marketplace}* is created in your plentymarkets system. A new selection value is added to the *{marketplace} category group* property for each category selected in the *Settings* step of the assistant. In order for your variations to be exported in the appropriate catalogue, they have to be linked to the *{marketplace} category group* property in the *Properties* tab of a variation.

[.instruction]
Linking a variation to a category:

. Go to *Item » Edit item »* _Open item_.
. Click on the *Variations* tab.
. Open the variation that should be linked.
. Open the *Properties* tab.
. In the *Variation properties* area, select the property *{marketplace} category group* from the *Properties* drop-down list and click on *Add* (icon:plus-square[role="green"]). +
→ The property is added.
. Select the desired category group from the *Value* drop-down list for the *{marketplace} category group* property. +
→ The variation will be exported in this catalogue. +
*_Example:_*If you pick the value *{category-example}*, the catalogue variation is exported for the *{category-example}* category.
. Repeat steps 5 and 6 for all categories where you want to offer the variation.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

== Setting up event procedures

Set up an <<automation/event-procedures#, event procedure>> to automatically update the order status on {marketplace} whenever specific events occur. You can set up the following event procedures:

* Report order confirmation to {marketplace}
* Report shipping confirmation to {marketplace}
* Report order cancellation to {marketplace}
* Report refund to {marketplace}

How to set up the event procedures in plentymarkets is described in the following chapters.

[IMPORTANT]
.Additional procedures
====
In addition to the event procedures listed above, the {marketplace} plugin provides several other event procedures. These procedures exist because order processing differs between plentymarkets and Mirakl.

However, we recommend that you only use the procedures described in detail.
