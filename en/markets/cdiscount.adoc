In order for the interface to successfully carry out the item export, the order import and the stock synchronisation, certain settings are mandatory. Pay attention to the following list.

[IMPORTANT]
.Product creation on Cdiscount
====
The product creation serves as a query to add a new product to Cdiscount's product database.
