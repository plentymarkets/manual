== Reporting cancellations

Cancellations, in the proper meaning of the word, cannot be transferred to La Redoute. If you want to cancel an order, e.g. because you have removed the item from your portfolio, then you have to create a return.

plentymarkets automatically accepts new orders from La Redoute. This allows data to be imported into your plentymarkets system in general. One consequence of accepting orders is that they cannot be cancelled afterwards. Therefore, book the outgoing items first and then create a return directly afterwards.

[TIP]

====
If you cancel an order, make sure to send an email to the customer and inform him or her about the item, e.g. explaining that the item is no longer part of your product range.
