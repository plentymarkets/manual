== Setting up the item export

Item data is exported to limango via a catalogue format. Go to *Data » Catalogues* to create catalogues. Is this your first time working with catalogues? Then read up on the <<en/data/exporting-data/managing-catalogues, principle of catalogues first>>.

To export your item data to limango, you need to create a catalogue. Link the limango data fields with the item data saved in plentymarkets in the marketplace format afterwards. After you activate the catalogue, the catalogue data is automatically exported to limango in regular intervals.

[#901]
=== Notes on the limango item data structure

The structure of limango item data differs from the structure in plentymarkets. The limango item data is categorised into three levels:

. *Product group:* A product in all its different versions
. *Product:* A colour version of the product
. *Variation:* The size / EAN / SKU

If the product is only available in a single version, then the product group is equivalent to the variant.

[IMPORTANT]
.Use the parent-SKU
====
Do you sell products in different colours but manage these different colours in separate items? The parent SKU allows you to link these separate items. Parent SKUs can be saved for both items and individual variations. The manual maintenance of SKUs allows you to assign the Parent SKU of entirely different item variations to variations of an item.

* You can assign the Parent SKU of a variation which belongs to an entirely different item five times to an item with five variations. These variations are listed on limango as variations of the item with the Parent SKU they are assigned to. +
* If one variation has a different Parent SKU than the remaining variations of an item, then two different items are listed on limango. You only have to maintain one item in your plentymarkets system.
====

[#902]
=== Creating a catalogue

Item data is exported to limango via catalogue using the marketplace format *limango*. Create a catalogue in the *Data » Catalogue* menu to export your items to limango. Link the limango data fields with item data saved in plentymarkets in the marketplace format afterwards. Is this your first time working with catalogues? Then read up on the <<en/data/exporting-data/managing-catalogues, principle of catalogues first>>.

TIP: You can create only one catalogue for limango. Multiple catalogues are currently not supported for limango.

:catalogue-template-name: limango
:catalogue-plugin:

include::_textblocks/instructions/creating-catalogues.adoc[]

[#903]
=== Mapping catalogue fields

After you have created a catalogue, map the market's data fields to item data saved in plentymarkets. This chapter describes how you map data fields and what particularities apply for item exports to limango. In addition, we provide recommendations for suitable mappings. This information is structured as follows:

* <<#907, Mapping data fields in the catalogue>>
* <<#905, Notes on mapping data fields>>
* <<#906, Recommendations for limango data field mapping>>

[#907]
==== Mapping data fields in the catalogue

Now, map the limango data fields to the item data saved in plentymarkets. Take note of the information regarding specific mappings and recommendations in this chapter.

include::_textblocks/instructions/catalogue-map-data-fields.adoc[]

[#905]
==== Notes on mapping data fields

Every market structures item data differently. As such, there are some particularities for each market when mapping data fields. <<#catalogue-limango-mappings>> contains mapping information for important data fields for limango.

[[catalogue-limango-mappings]]
.Notes on mapping data fields
[cols="1,3a"]
|====
| Marketplace data field | plentymarkets data field

| *Description*
a| If you want to sell shoes on the market, all information regarding the material of your products must be exported to limango using the data field *Description*. To do this, you combine two plentymarkets data fields and export them as one filed to limango.

First, decide how you want to manage material information for your items. There are two ways to manage material information for limango:

* Enter the material information in the data field *Technical data* of the item.

_or_

* Create a property of the type *Text*. Link this property to the main variation of the item and manage the material information in this property.

Now, map the plentymarkets data field that you want in the catalogue:

. Map the plentymarkets data field that contains the item description to the marketplace data field *Description*.
. To the right of this data field, click on *Add data field* (icon:link[rotate=90]).
. Map the plentymarkets data field that contains the material information. +
*_Tip:_* This is either the field *Technical data* or the property that you created for the material information.
. To the right of the column, click on *Settings* (icon:cog[]).
. From the drop-down list *Separator*, select the option *Space*.

| Measurements +
(*Length*; +
*Width*; +
*Height*; +
*Volume*; +
*Diameter*; +
*Weight* +
etc.)
a| Measurements must be exported to limango with the format *[numeric value];[unit]*. Due to the limango product structure, the normal plentymarkets data fields for measurements cannot be mapped. Instead, create two properties:

* One property of the type *Decimal number* for the numerical value.
* One property of the type *Selection* for the unit.

Combine these two properties, separated by a semicolon.

[.collapseBox]
.*_Example:_* Exporting the length to limango
--
. Create a property of the type *Decimal number* with the name *Length*.
. Create a property of the type *Selection* with the name *Length unit*.
. Add the units you need to the property *Length unit* as property values.
. Open the limango catalogue.
. Map the marketplace data field *Length* to the plentymarkets property *Length*.
. To the right of this data field, click on *Add data field* (icon:link[rotate=90]).
. Map the property *Length unit*. +
*_Tip:_* If you are sure that you only need one unit for all your variations, you can also export the unit by entering it as an own value. To do so, instead of mapping the property *Length unit*, map the field *Own value* and enter the unit in the field that opens.
. To the right of the column, click on *Settings* (icon:cog[]).
. From the drop-down list *Separator*, select the option *Semicolon*.
--

[.collapseBox]
.*_Example:_* Exporting the volume to limango
--
. Create a property of the type *Decimal number* with the name *Volume*.
. Create a property of the type *Selection* with the name *Volume unit*.
. Add the units you need to the property *Volume unit* as property values. +
*_Note:_* Only the units l (for litres) and ml (for millilitres) can be exported.
. Open the limango catalogue.
. Map the marketplace data field *Volume* to the plentymarkets property *Volume*.
. To the right of this data field, click on *Add data field* (icon:link[rotate=90]).
. Map the property *Volume unit*. +
*_Tip:_* If you are sure that you only need one unit for all your variations, you can also export the unit by entering it as an own value. To do so, instead of mapping the property *Volume unit*, map the field *Own value* and enter the unit in the field that opens.
. To the right of the column, click on *Settings* (icon:cog[]).
. From the drop-down list *Separator*, select the option *Semicolon*.
--

| Data fields under Material composition
a| Material information is exported to limango using a property of the type *Short text*. You need one property for each marketplace data field. This property is used to save all components of the material mix for a main variation.
Enter the material composition in the following format:

* *{"material1": "percentage","material2": "percentage","material3": "percentage"}* +
*_Example:_* *{"baumwolle": "90","elasthan": "10"}*

Specify the individual materials in descending order based on the percentage value. As such, the first material is the one with the highest percentage value, the last one that with the lowest percentage value. The sum of all percentages must be 100. You can specify as many materials as you need.

[.collapseBox]
.*_Example:_* Exporting material information for a blazer to limango
--
The following example shows you how to save material information for a blazer for the limango export.

[.instruction]
Mapping outer fabric and saving material mix for a variation:

. Create a property of the type *Short text* with the name *Material 1*.
. Map the marketplace data field *Material 1* to the plentymarkets property *Material 1*.
. Link the property *Material 1* to the main variation of the item.
. Our blazer is made of 65% polyester, 32% rayon and 3% elastane. Enter the following into the text field of the property:
  * {"polyester": "65","viskose": "32","elastan": "3"}
. Save the settings.

[.instruction]
Mapping lining and saving material mix for a variation:

. Create a property of the type *Short text* with the name *Lining 1*.
. Map the marketplace data field *Lining 1* to the plentymarkets property *Lining 1*.
. Link the property *Lining 1* to the main variation of the item.
. The lining of the blazer is made of 100% rayon. Enter the following into the text field of the property:
  *
. Save the settings.
--

| *Colour value*
| limango distinguishes by colours but not by shades. For example, if you offer a dress in both light and dark green, both are presented if customers search for green dresses on the market.

To ensure that different products are created for variations in different shades of the same colour, the colour value saved in plentymarkets is exported as part of the merchant product ID and the product name instead of the limango colour value.

[.collapseBox]
.*_Example:_* Mapping different shades of green to the colour value *green*
--
This example shows you how to map different shades of green to the colour value *green*.

[.instruction]
Assumed scenario:

You want to map all your shades of green to the limango colour value *green*.

The following shades of green are saved as values of the attribute *Colour*:

* Light green
* Dark green

The following shades of green are saved as property values:

* Lime green
* Coriander

[.instruction]
Mapping different shades of green to the colour value "green":

. Open the limango catalogue.
. Navigate to the area *Colour*.
. Map the marketplace data field *Colour* to the following plentymarkets data fields: +
*_Data field:_* Field *Value name* of the attribute for *Colour* +
*_Fallback data fields:_* Property for *Colour*
. Navigate to the area *Colour value*.
. Map the marketplace data field *Colour value: green* to the plentymarkets attribute value *Light green*.
. Click on *+ Add fallback data field*.
. As the first fallback data field, map the plentymarkets attribute value *Dark green*.
. Click on *+ Add fallback data field*.
. As the second fallback data field, map the plentymarkets property value *Lime green*.
. Click on *+ Add fallback data field*.
. As the third fallback data field, map the plentymarkets property value *Coriander*. +
→ The shade of green that is saved for the variation is exported as part of the merchant product ID and the product name. +
→ On limango, all products are listed with the colour Green. +
*_Tip:_* The order for mapping the different shades described here is random. You can map the values in any order.

== Setting up automatic shipping confirmations

Shipping confirmations for limango must contain a tracking number. In addition, the shipping service provider of the order must be linked to the limango shipping service provider correctly in the plugin settings.

You need two event procedures to automatically confirm the shipping to limango:

* Event procedure 1: Send shipping confirmation to limango
* Event procedure 2: Book outgoing items

[#13001]
=== Workflow for automatic order confirmations

The workflow for automated shipping confirmations depends on whether or not the order’s shipping service provider is correctly linked to the limango shipping service provider in the plugin settings.

[cols="1,3a"]
