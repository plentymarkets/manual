Item data is exported to limango via catalogue formats. Go to *Data » Catalogues* to create catalogues. Is this your first time working with catalogues? Then read up on the <<en/data/exporting-data/managing-catalogues, principle of catalogues first>>.

To export your item data to limango, you need to create a catalogue. Link the limango data fields with the item data saved in plentymarkets in the marketplace format afterwards. After you activate the catalogue, the catalogue data is automatically exported to limango in regular intervals.

=== Notes on the limango item data structure

The structure of limango item data differs from the structure in plentymarkets. The limango item data is categorised into three levels:

. *Product group:* Corresponds to a product in all its different versions
. *Product:* Corresponds to a specific colour version of the product
. *Variation:* Is equivalent to the size / EAN / SKU

If the product is only available in a single version, then product group = variant.

[#902]
=== Creating a catalogue

Item data is exported to limango via catalogue using the marketplace format *limango*. Create a catalogue in the *Data » Catalogue* menu to export your items to limango. Link the limango data fields with item data saved in plentymarkets in the marketplace format afterwards. Is this your first time working with catalogues? Then read up on the <<en/data/exporting-data/managing-catalogues, principle of catalogues first>>.

TIP: You can create only one catalogue for limango. Multiple catalogues are currently not supported for limango.
