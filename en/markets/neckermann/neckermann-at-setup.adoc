== Generating Neckermann invoices

The procedure for generating Neckermann invoices differs from the procedure for other order referrers. This is why there is an additional menu for generating Neckermann invoices in plentymarkets. Invoices for *Neckermann orders* are not generated in your plentymarkets system, as is the case for invoices with other order referrers. Instead, your plentymarkets system receives a special file (pcl format) directly from Neckermann, which contains the orders that you received.

You can carry out settings related to the layout of the invoices in the *Setup » Client » Select a client » Locations » Select a location » Documents » Invoice* menu. Go to *Setup » Orders » Events* in order to define which additional procedure should be carried out when the invoice is printed. If you would like the procedure to be limited to orders from the Neckermann market only, then make sure that you create a filter with the *Referrer* filter type and select *Neckermann* within the filter.

Use the *Generate Neckermann invoices* menu to filter out the orders of your choice from all of the Neckermann orders that you received and to open the corresponding invoices in a separate file. With the help of the search filter in this area, you can determine which criteria should be used to select orders for the retrieval of invoices.

[.instruction]
Retrieving Neckermann invoices:

. Go to *Orders » Fulfillment » Generate Neckermann invoices*.
. Set the desired *search filter* options.
. Under *Procedure*, select the *Order status* that you would like to have assigned to the selected orders after the invoices were successfully retrieved.
. Carry out the settings. Pay attention to the explanations given in <<#settings-neckermann-invoices>>.
. Click on the *gear-wheel icon*. +
→ A zip file is created which contains the invoices corresponding to all of the orders that you selected with the filter options.
. After you have unzipped this file, you can save and print your invoices.
