=== Item data export via API (PWS 2.0)

===== Not all of my items are exported to idealo. What can I do?

[.indented]
If you transfer your items to idealo via API (PWS 2.0), but not all of your items have been exported, you can try to update the timestamp for market exports. Updating the timestamp might help because usually, only variations which have been updated within the last two days are exported to idealo.

[.instruction]
Updating the timestamp for market exports:

. Go to *Item » Batch processing*.
. In the *Procedures* area, activate the option *Update timestamp for market exports*.
. Click on *Apply* (icon:execute[set=plenty]). +
→ All items which are configured for idealo will be exported to idealo with the next item export.
