|*Adjust quantity to the net stock when listing*
|Select *activated* or *deactivated*. +

.Settings for the checkout
[cols="1,3"]
|====
| Setting | Explanation

|*Default order status*
|Select *Status 1* (incomplete data) or *Status 3* (waiting for payment). +
*Status 1* = The customer is guided through the order process and has to actively complete all steps. This takes place within the online store and therefore, the customer is encouraged to buy additional items. +
*Status 3* = The customer receives a summary of the order and does not have to be active. However, the customers can change some data, e.g. their addresses. +
You can also change the order status in the listing settings. This listing setting takes priority over the setting that is chosen here.

|*Default order status for orders containing unknown items (ID: -2)*
|Select *Status 2* (waiting for activation) or *Status 3* (waiting for payment). If a listing cannot be assigned to an item during the order import, it receives the ID -2.

|*Item names in order items*
|Select *Copy item name from the market* or *Copy item name from the store*. +
*Copy item name from the market* = The item name is transferred from the market. +
*Copy item name from the store* = The item name saved in plentymarkets is transferred.

|*Down-selling in the checkout process*
|Select *Enable* or *Disable*. +
Down-selling means that the customer can reduce the quantity purchased on ricardo during the checkout. Up-selling is generally possible for fixed-price items. This is why up-selling cannot be selected here.

|*Shipping costs for new orders coming from ricardo*
|Select *Transfer from ricardo* or *Have it calculated by plentymarkets*. +
*Transfer from ricardo* = Shipping costs are transferred from ricardo.ch. +
*Have it calculated by plentymarkets* = Shipping costs are calculated based on the shipping profiles in plentymarkets.

*Yes, but with online store shipping costs* = The shipping costs of the online store are added.

|*Item assignment after sale*
|Select one of the following options to assign a listing to an item during the order import: +
*Automatically* +
*No automatic assignment based on title* +
*No automatic assignment* +

*Assignment based on external item ID* +
*Assignment of SKU to variation number* +
The item ID *-2* is used if a listing could not be assigned or should not be assigned.

[#1200]
=== Setting up the listing scheduler

With plentymarkets, you can automatically place listings on the market at a certain time and you can automatically restart finished listings. Use the listing scheduler to set up these automatic procedures. Listings can be linked to several listing schedulers.

If you want plentymarkets to automatically start listings at a certain time, you have to define time intervals in the listing scheduler. Either select *days of the week* or up to three *days of the month* in the listing scheduler. In both cases, you also have to choose *starting times* for the listing.

[.instruction]
Setting up the listing scheduler:

. Go to *Setup » Listings » Scheduler*.
. Click on *Create new listing scheduler* to add a new listing scheduler.
. Carry out the desired settings. Pay attention to the explanations given in <<settings-scheduler-ricardo>>.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

[[settings-scheduler-ricardo]]
.Settings for the listing scheduler
[cols="1,3"]
|====
| Setting | Explanation

|*Name*
|Enter a name for the listing scheduler.

|*Lister*
|Select *Active* or *Inactive* (do not list any listings).

|*Runtime*
|Select *use listing runtime* or select one of the given runtime options in days. If a runtime in days is selected for the listing scheduler, the system will always use this runtime for the listing even if a different runtime has been entered for the listing itself.

|*Start times*
|Define one or several daily starting times. For technical reasons, if you select several starting times, then they all have to be *at least 60 minutes apart from each other*.

|*Distribution*
|Select a time limit in *minutes*. The listings linked to this listing scheduler are started in equal time intervals throughout the selected period of time. If the value 120 minutes was selected for the distribution of 10 listings, then one listing would be started every 12 minutes.

|*Day*
|Define up to three days that listings should be started on.

|*Weekday*
|Activate *days of the week* that the listing should be started on.
|====

[#1300]
=== Managing layout templates

Use layout templates to give listings a certain layout. The advantage of such a template is that you use plain text only in the actual item description without any design elements. Thus, layout templates reduce the need for maintenance of the item description. Furthermore, basic and general information such as the legal disclosure and shipping information can be saved in the layout template. When adjusting the layout template, these adjustments are applied to all listings linked to this template. In plentymarkets, you can create and adjust as many layout templates as you like.

Layout templates for listings use the same structure as the <<online-store/online-store/cms#web-design, plentymarkets web design>>. The content that you want to display for listings can be saved using template variables and functions in the *Main frame* tab in the *Setup » Listings » Layouts* menu. The content is structured with HTML and CSS. The different tabs are described below.

[IMPORTANT]
.Commissioning third-party providers
====
HTML and CSS skills are necessary to create a layout template. We recommend that you commission a service provider to create a layout template if you are not experienced in doing so. Go to *Setup » Listings » Layouts* to import a <<Managing layout templates, layout template>> that was created externally into plentymarkets.
====

[.subhead]
Main frame

In the *Main frame* tab, enter the visible content for listings that are set up with this layout template. Replace dynamic content such as the item description, item images, listing description and so on with template variables and functions. They are replaced by the corresponding content of the listing.

[.subhead]
HTML structure

In the *HtmlStructure* tab, enter the HTML code that provides the content of the layout template with the desired structure. The template variable *$MainFrame* displays the dynamic content saved in the *Main frame* tab.

[.subhead]
CSS

In the *CSS* tab, set up the cascading style sheet that is used to display the layout template. CSS denotes a markup language for structured documents. While HTML lets you create the pure content, CSS offers you more possibilities to influence the format and structure of this content, e.g. font type and size.

|*Gallery 1-3*
|Enter the JavaScript code for the content of the data fields *Gallery 1* to *3*. Enter the template variable at the desired location within the *Main frame* tab of the layout template. +
Make sure that the images used are available via URL. To do so, upload the images on the server e.g. using <<basics/admin-tasks/ftp-access#, FTP>>.

[#1500]
==== Example code for a layout template

An example code for a layout template is provided below. Image 1 shows the preview of a listing that is linked to a layout template based on this code. In this example, *plentymarkets logo and slogan* was selected for the option *plentymarkets signature* in the *Settings* tab.

[.instruction]
Linking listings to layout templates:

. Go to *Listings » Edit listings*.
. Open a listing and click on the *Description and layout* tab.
. Use the drop-down list to select which *layout template* you want to link to the listing.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings. +
→ The listing is linked to this layout template.

[#1660]
==== Template variables and template functions

Fill the HTML layout with the desired and necessary template variables and functions and this way, have the corresponding content of the listing placed in the layout. Pay attention to upper and lower case letters in the template variables and functions.

Fill in the item description *{% GetItemDescription() %}* instead of the description that is saved with the listing. This way, you only need to maintain one description text for your online store and listings.

[IMPORTANT]
.Activate the Wildcard character in layout template (ricardo) option
====
If you use template variables which contain properties, such as *{% GetItemPropertyById() %}* and *{% GetItemPropertyByName() %}*, you have to activate the *Wildcard character in layout template (ricardo)* option for the selected property, so that the property is displayed in the layout template. This is done in the *Setup » Item » Characteristics* menu.
