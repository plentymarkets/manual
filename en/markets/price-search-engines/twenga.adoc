== Registering with Twenga.com

Twenga.com is an international shopping platform that offers comprehensive price comparisons.

== Setting up the data format TwengaCOM-Plugin in plentymarkets

By installing the TwengaCOM plugin, you will receive the export format *TwengaCOM-Plugin*. Use this format to exchange data between plentymarkets and Twenga.com. You also need to install the plugin *Elastic export* from the plentyMarketplace first before you can use the format in plentymarkets.

Once both plugins are installed in your plentymarkets system, you can create the export format *TwengaCOM-Plugin*. For more information on export formats, see the <<data/exporting-data/elastic-export#, elastic export>> page.
