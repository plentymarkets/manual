== Registering with Google Shopping

The price comparison portal Google Shopping offers search and comparison functions as well as links to the product pages in other online stores. +

Store owners can display their products in Google Shopping lists within the Google search. Stores are billed for the service per click. This format is based on Google Shopping International. Therefore, linked characteristic values and availabilities have to be saved in English.

In order to set up the Google Shopping plugin in plentymarkets, you have to register with Google Shopping first.
