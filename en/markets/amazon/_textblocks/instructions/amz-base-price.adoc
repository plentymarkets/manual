=== Preparing the export of unit price information

In some countries, the unit price must be specified for products that are sold by weight, volume, length or surface area.

Amazon calculates the unit price based on the price, the quantity and the unit of measure that you export. Amazon expects different fields for different categories. Check the Amazon flatfile for the category to find out which values need to be exported.

* Create a property for each field that Amazon expects to receive for calculating the unit price of your variations.
* Link the properties with the variation and save the values for the variation.
