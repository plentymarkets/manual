link:https://www.amazon.co.uk/[Amazon^] has gone from being the largest internet book store to one of the leading universal shopping centres. Various customers appreciate the large portfolio, rely on the high product quality and expect best service such as fast delivery. With plentymarkets, you have full access to Amazon. Learn how to make items available, activate the interface for data exchange, use the FBA service by Amazon and many more. The abbreviation FBA stands for Fulfilment by Amazon, a service from Amazon where Amazon takes care of the entire stock management and logistics.

[#100]
==  Registering with Amazon

Before carrying out the settings in plentymarkets, you have to register as a seller on Amazon. Amazon Seller Central is the central Amazon interface for sellers. On the Amazon UK platform, sellers who sell more than 35 items per month are considered Pro sellers and only have the possibility to upload item lists from this amount on. plentymarkets users need to select the Pro option. It is only possible to use automatic procedures and APIs to manage stock and offers with the Pro option. This option includes a monthly subscription fee as well as additional fees for each item sold. For further information, refer to the link:https://services.amazon.co.uk/services/sell-online/pricing.html[Amazon website^].

[.subhead]
MWS authorisation

Once you have registered, set up the MWS interface on Amazon. MWS stands for Marketplace Web Service. This service supports API functions. As such, it needs to be set up in order to exchange data with plentymarkets.

Open this link:https://sellercentral.amazon.de/apps/manage[link^] and click on *Authorise a developer* to authorise plentymarkets as developer and to allow access to your account. You need the following information for the interface:

*  Developer Nickname: plentymarkets
*  Developer ID for European markets: 6860-7675-7360
*  Developer ID for the US market: 5751-6263-3716

Once you have set up Amazon MWS, you will receive the merchant ID that you need for setting up the interface in plentymarkets.

[TIP]

====
"Amazon has unified its European marketplaces, allowing you to create and manage product offers on any and all of our Amazon marketplaces in the UK, France, Germany, Spain and Italy. You control what you sell and where. You manage your business from a single seller account interface. When you sign up to sell on Amazon.co.uk, your seller account is automatically enabled to allow you to sell on Amazon.de, Amazon.fr, Amazon.es and Amazon.it. You will be asked to define your home marketplace which can be any of the 4 marketplaces. We recommend that you choose your home marketplace as the country from where you will be operating and fulfilling your orders." (Source: Amazon). +
Refer to Amazon’s link:https://services.amazon.co.uk/services/sell-online/international-selling.html[information^] about the European Marketplaces Account.
====

[#350]
[.subhead]
Amazon platform

If you sell on multiple Amazon platforms with a European Marketplaces Account, then set up a new account for each platform in plentymarkets, depending on which options you want to use, and configure each platform separately. Set up separate accounts for the price synchronisation, the item data export and the import of pending orders. For example, if you only want to use stock synchronisation, do not create a separate account for each country platform. +
The same access data is used for all platforms.

[TIP]
.Amazon platforms
====
With plentymarkets, you can sell on the Amazon platforms Amazon.de, Amazon.co.uk, Amazon.fr, Amazon.it, Amazon.es, Amazon.com, Amazon.ca, and Amazon.com.mx.
====

[#400]
===  Carrying out the initial settings

All entries in the *Access data* section of the *Settings* tab are mandatory entries. Enter the data and pay attention to the explanations given in <<settings-access-data>>.

[[settings-access-data]]
.Settings for *Access data*
[cols="1,3"]
|====
| Setting | Explanation

|*Amazon platform*
| A platform has to be selected when the account is created. However, the platform can be changed here. If you have a European Marketplaces Account, then you can carry out the settings for each platform on which you want to offer your products separately. For further information, refer to the section <<Setting up an account, Amazon platform>>.

|*Seller ID*
| Enter the seller ID that you have received from Amazon. If you have a European Marketplaces Account, then the same seller ID is used for every platform.

|*Merchant token*
| Enter the merchant token that you can find on Seller Central.

|*Email address*
| Enter the email address that is used as user name for the Seller Central account.

|*Active*
| Place a check mark to activate the interface. +
Only place a check mark once all of the settings have been carried out. This prevents incorrect data from accidentally being transferred.

|*B2B*
| Place a check mark to activate this account for Amazon business.
|====

Carry out settings that relate to the SKU structure in the *Initial settings* section. The SKU (Stock Keeping Unit) is a unique reference number for all items and item variations on Amazon.

[[tab-initial-settings]]
.Settings in the *Initial settings* tab
[cols="1,3"]
|====
| Setting | Explanation

|*Client*
| Select which client should be used for orders from Amazon.

|*SKU structure*
| Select one of the following options: +
*Variation ID* +
*GTIN if available, otherwise variation ID* +
*Variation number if available, otherwise variation ID* +
The selected setting only goes into effect for items that are exported to Amazon for the first time. Amazon and your online store exchange data based on these SKUs. +
*Important:* Do not change this setting after items have been transferred to Amazon. If you do so, communication, e.g. stock updates, between plentymarkets and Amazon will no longer be possible. +
Pay attention to the note below the table with the title *Assigning already existing SKU numbers*.

|*Catalogue was listed with SSW*
|*Yes* = Items are listed on Amazon with link:https://www.starsellersworld.com/[starsellersworld^]. The item SKU will be cut off right behind the last "-" when importing the items. This makes it possible to match the item in the system. +
*No* = Items are not listed on Amazon with starsellersworld.

|*Generate invoice*
| Select whether invoices should be generated by plentymarkets or by Amazon. +
*plentymarkets* = Invoices are generated by plentymarkets. +
Create an event procedure if you would like to upload invoices that were generated in plentymarkets to Amazon. For further information, refer to the <<Uploading invoices to Amazon, Uploading invoices to Amazon>> chapter. +
*VCS plentymarkets* = *Condition:* <<Activating Amazon VCS in plentymarkets, Amazon VCS>> is activated. Amazon invoices are automatically generated by plentymarkets and transferred to Amazon. +
*VCS Amazon* = *Condition:* <<Activating Amazon VCS in plentymarkets, Amazon VCS>> is activated. Amazon invoices are generated by Amazon. +
Amazon invoices and credit notes are imported into plentymarkets.
|====

[TIP]
.SKU settings and stock synchronisation
====
If the same settings for SKU numbers are selected for all platforms, then you can synchronise all platforms for the European Marketplaces Account with the stock synchronisation. If the settings are not the same, then the synchronisation must be carried out separately for each platform.

Since the stock is managed globally for a European Marketplaces Account, it is sufficient to activate the stock for your home marketplace. Nevertheless, the SKU settings must match.
====

[IMPORTANT]
.Assigning already existing SKU numbers
====
If you have already started selling your items on Amazon and now you want to start selling them with plentymarkets, you have to assign already existing SKUs in the *Item » Edit item » Open item » Tab: Variation ID » Tab: Settings » Tab: Availability* menu.
====

[IMPORTANT]
.Authorising plentymarkets email addresses
====
All plentymarkets email addresses which are used to send messages to Amazon have to be authorised first within your Seller Central account on Amazon.
====

== Setting up freely definable fields in the Amazon export (Seller Central)

The freely definable fields are used to customise the data that you export to Amazon. Those fields have to be linked to <<item/managing-items#70, free text fields>>. The free text fields allow you to individually customise the item data and therefore save an exact description of the item.

[#1000]
=== Creating free text fields

First, create the <<item/managing-items#70, free text fields>> that you want to link to freely definable fields on Amazon. Proceed as described below.

[.instruction]
Creating free text fields:

. Go to *Setup » Item » Free text fields*.
. Enter a name under *Field name*.
. Select the *data type* from the drop-down list.
. Enter the maximum number of *characters* for the free text field.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings. +
→ The free text fields will be available the next day in the editing window of the items in the *Fields* tab. Enter the actual text there.

[#1300]
== Linking categories

You have to save some information in your plentymarkets categories in order for your items to automatically be assigned to the existing categories when exporting them to Amazon. The so called Browse Tree Guides (BTG) from Amazon provide you with classification information. This information is provided in table format (MS Excel) and contains unique classification numbers, the so called Browse Node IDs, which you will have to assign to your online store categories. The lists are available in the help centre of the Seller Central or via this link:https://sellercentral-europe.amazon.com/gp/help/help-folder.html/?ie=UTF8&itemID=1661[link^].

Using the official Browse Tree Guides for the Amazon platform that you want to sell your products on ensures that your items can be found quickly and easily in the Amazon catalogue. The Browse Node IDs form the basis for the item/product assignment in the navigation as well as in the product search. Due to the large amount of items offered on Amazon, an explicit assignment of your items into these Browse Node IDs determines whether a customer will find your product in the corresponding category or not. Therefore, we recommend that you take some time when carrying out this next step and that you select the Browse Node IDs carefully.

Go to *Setup » Markets » Amazon » Category link* to link categories. In plentymarkets, you can link each item category with up to two Amazon classification numbers from the Browse Tree Guides.

It is absolutely necessary that you link the entered values separately line by line.

The category links are only taken into consideration for the default categories, which were selected for an item under *Item » Edit item » Open item » Tab: Categories*.

[.instruction]
Linking Amazon categories:

. Use this link:https://sellercentral-europe.amazon.com/gp/help/help-folder.html/?ie=UTF8&itemID=1661[link^] to access the help centre within Seller Central.
. Select the desired classification list, e.g. apparel.
. Look up the desired category name in the *node path* column (e.g. blouse).
. Go to *Setup » Markets » Amazon » Category link* in your plentymarkets back end.
. Enter the corresponding Browse Node ID from the list into the table.
. Click on the *gear-wheel icon* that corresponds to the category that you want to link.

[IMPORTANT]
.Exporting the Browse Node ID
====
The Browse Node ID that was assigned when selecting the category is inserted into the *RecommendedBrowseNode1* field during the data export. The *RecommendedBrowseNode2* field is only used for categories that are linked multiple times.
====

[#1350]
== Linking attributes and attribute values

<<item/managing-items#390, Attributes>> also have to be linked before your items can be transferred to Amazon. It is also possible to link attributes for several languages.

[.instruction]
Linking attributes and attribute values:

. Go to *Setup » Item » Attributes*. +
→ The overview of all attributes used in your catalogue opens.
. Open an attribute.
. Click on the *Attribute link* tab.
. Click on *Amazon*.  +
→ The Amazon section for the attribute link is displayed.
. Select the corresponding Amazon category from the drop-down list.
. Enter the Amazon attribute values that most closely match your own attribute values.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.
. Repeat this process for all remaining attributes.

Next, activate the attributes within the item settings.

[IMPORTANT]
.Deactivate main variation without an attribute link
====
If an item's variations have attribute links but the main variation has none, then the main variation has to be set to inactive. Otherwise, the main variation will be exported as a single item. The main variation must be activated if it has an attribute link.
====

[#1390]
== Linking variation properties with Amazon

Use <<item/managing-items#3000, variation properties>> to define individual characteristics of a variation.

Link variation properties that you have created in the *Setup » Settings » Properties » Configuration* and added to a variation with Amazon in the *Setup » Settings » Properties » Configuration » Tab: Amazon* menu.

[IMPORTANT]
.Variation properties are prioritised over properties
====
If you linked a property and a variation property with the same Amazon field, then the variation property is prioritised over the property. The property is overwritten by the variation property during the item export.
====

[.instruction]
Linking a variation property with Amazon:

. Go to *Setup » Settings » Properties » Configuration*.
. Open the property.
. Click on the *Visibility* tab.
. Activate an *Amazon referrer* under *Referrers*.

[#1400]
== Linking properties with Amazon

In case you ever need to define the parameters or characteristics of items for Amazon which cannot directly be set up with plentymarkets, we have developed the solution that is described here: Parameters or values are integrated by means of the properties.

The item’s property and the Amazon product type are linked in the *Setup » Item » Characteristics* menu. In plentymarkets, you can save a maximum of 16 links for one property.

[.instruction]
Linking properties with the Amazon product type:

. Go to *Setup » Item » Characteristics*.
. Expand (icon:plus-square-o[]) the property that you want to use for Amazon. +
→ The property's editing section opens.
. Select the category from the *Amazon link* drop-down list. +
→ A new drop-down list appears.
. Select the Amazon field from the drop-down list.
. Click on *Add* (icon:plus-square[role="green"]). +
→ The link is created.

[TIP]
.Tip: Property type “selection”
====
All property types can be used for the Amazon link. Properties of the types *Selection* and *Text* can be used to transfer multilingual properties.
====

[.subhead]

. Click on the *gear-wheel icon* to carry out the import.

[TIP]
.Tip: Imported orders
====
If orders are imported from Amazon that you did not upload with plentymarkets and/or that contain items which have not yet been created in plentymarkets, then you can manually assign the items for these orders and set the corresponding status.
====

[IMPORTANT]
.Missing invoice address
====
If the invoice address is missing from the orders that were retrieved from Amazon, then contact the Amazon support. Amazon has to carry out this setting.
====

[TIP]
.Original currency and standard currency are different
====
Additional information is saved for orders that are imported with a different currency than the standard currency saved in plentymarkets. In this case, both the original currency and the original gross and net amounts are saved for every item included in the order.
====

[#2200]
=== Sending shipping confirmations to Amazon

As soon as the Amazon order was processed in your plentymarkets system and the goods were shipped, you have to inform Amazon of the new status so that the sales figures can be credited to your account. Your plentymarkets system automatically takes care of this important step via the interface as well.

Orders have to meet the following requirements in order for the shipping confirmation to be sent to Amazon:

*  Referrer: Amazon or an Amazon sub-referrer
*  Status range 7 (less than 8)
*  External order number
*  Imported order (not created manually)
*  Outgoing items booked (time must not be in the future)

If the shipping confirmation is not automatically transferred, e.g. because the servers are temporarily unavailable, or if you want orders to be manually confirmed shortly before an accounting deadline, so that they will still be taken into consideration during the next payment, then you can also transfer shipping confirmations manually to Amazon. No shipping confirmation is sent to Amazon for Prime orders (Amazon_Prime, Amazon_PrimeSame_Day, Amazon_Prime_NextDay, and Amazon_Prime_SecondDay).
[.instruction]
Manually sending shipping confirmations to Amazon:

. Go to *Setup » Markets » Amazon » Data exchange » Shipping confirmation*.
. Select an Amazon account from the drop-down list.
. Enter a date next to *Items shipped on*. +
→ All of the outgoing items from this date are transmitted to Amazon.
. Click on *Send shipping confirmation*.

[#2300]
=== Editing Amazon order reports

In the *Setup » Markets » Amazon » Data exchange » Reports* menu, you can define intervals for Amazon order reports and reset Amazon order reports from a specific date.

[#2350]
==== Setting intervals for order reports

Go to *Setup » Markets » Amazon » Data exchange » Reports » Tab: Scheduled reports* to define the interval in which order reports should be created by Amazon. Orders from these reports are imported during the automatic order import. Therefore, we recommend to use a low interval both for the generation of reports as well as for the order import. +
MFN order reports can be identified by the name *GET ORDERS DATA*. +

Additionally, you can retrieve tax reports and define an interval for the retrieval of FBA order reports in this menu. +

In order to create tax reports for Amazon Business, define an interval under *Tax reports*. Retrieve the tax reports for Amazon Business in the Amazon Seller Central. If you define an interval for the generation of tax reports in your plentymarkets system, you do not need to carry out any further settings in the Seller Central. +

If you activated Amazon FBA in the *Setup » Markets » Amazon » Settings » Tab: Order settings* menu, FBA order reports are automatically retrieved every 4 hours. In the *FBA orders* section, you can optionally define an interval for the retrieval of order reports.

[.instruction]
Defining an interval:

. Go to *Setup » Markets » Amazon » Data exchange » Reports » Tab: Scheduled reports*.
. Select an Amazon account from the drop-down list.
. Select an interval for the generation of order reports.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

[#2360]
==== Resetting order reports

In the *Setup » Markets » Amazon » Data exchange » Reports » Tab: MFN reports* menu, you can reset the Amazon order reports from a specific date.

If you reset order reports from a specific date, then these order reports will once again become available for import. When carrying out the import again, only the missing orders from this date are imported. This is done by synchronising the Amazon transaction number. If a transaction number already exists, then the order is not imported again. This ensures that orders are not duplicated.

[.instruction]
Resetting MFN reports:

. Go to *Setup » Markets » Amazon » Data exchange » Reports » Tab: MFN reports*.
. Select an Amazon account from the drop-down list.
. Select a date for which you would like to reset the MFN reports.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

[#2400]
=== Synchronising stock

Stock is synchronised with Amazon in the *Setup » Markets » Amazon » Data exchange » FBA stock* menu. There are a few different ways to do this. You can use the hourly automatic stock synchronisation, an automatic procedure or a CSV file.

[IMPORTANT]
.Only for Amazon Multi-Channel
====
This feature is intended for <<Setting up Amazon Multi-Channel, Amazon Multi-Channel>> only.
====

In plentymarkets, a distinction is made between automatic stock synchronisation and manual stock synchronisation. Both procedures are described below.

[#2500]
==== Automatically synchronising stock

Proceed as follows to automatically synchronise stock.

[.instruction]
Automatically synchronising stock:

. Go to *Setup » Markets » Amazon » Data exchange » FBA stock*.
. Select the Amazon account in the *Automatically* tab.
. Click on *Synchronise Amazon FBA stock*.

4 minutes are allotted for this process. If Amazon does not provide the data within this time frame, then stock is not synchronised. The next request will use the previous data that was not transferred. This can lead to errors. Therefore, we recommend that you manually synchronise data with a CSV file as described in the next chapter.

Stock information is only synchronised for those items that had their stock changed on Amazon in the last 30 days. We recommend that you use the manual synchronisation for the first import. The stock is synchronised according to the <<Carrying out the initial settings, initial settings>> in plentymarkets.

[#2600]
==== Manually synchronising stock

Stock is synchronised manually via CSV file.

[IMPORTANT]
.Assigning SKU numbers
====
If you want to manually synchronise data, then you also have to specify how SKU numbers should be assigned to the stock. This is specified in the <<Carrying out the initial settings, initial settings>>.
====

Before you carry out this synchronisation, you have to request the corresponding report file from Amazon in Seller Central. Download this CSV file and save it on your computer.

[.instruction]
Manually synchronising stock:

. Go to *Setup » Markets » Amazon » Data exchange » FBA stock*.
. Click on the *Manual* tab.
. Select the Amazon account.
. Click on *Select file* to select the CSV file that you have just saved.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings to carry out the synchronisation.

[#2700]
== Retrieving Amazon orders

Anyone who has worked with another shop system in the past can certainly remember just how time-consuming daily order processing in the Seller Central portal can be. All that is made significantly easier with plentymarkets. Here, all orders from all connected markets are collected together into one order folder. Amazon orders automatically become plentymarkets orders, which you can quickly and effectively work with according to the fulfilment procedure that you are accustomed to. You do not even have to worry about the order import. The interface takes care of that for you in the background. A few requirements have to be fulfilled so that everything works correctly. These are summarised in the following.

Orders are retrieved every 15 minutes. However, in some cases it can take up to 90 minutes until an order that was generated in Amazon will appear in your plentymarkets system. That is not a malfunction, but rather is the only possibility due to technical reasons. Usually, an email from Amazon informs you about the sale beforehand and you can already see the order in Seller Central.

[#2800]
=== Carrying out settings for the interface in plentymarkets

The basic settings *Incoming payment* and *Shipping confirmation* are relevant for importing orders. We assume that you transfer orders with the status *[5] cleared for shipping* and that you let the daily shipping confirmation be generated automatically by your plentymarkets system. Check these settings once again.

For further information about manual and automatic order import, refer to the <<FBA order import, FBA order import>> chapter.

[IMPORTANT]
.Editing returns for Amazon orders
====
Even with Amazon, you have to anticipate the occasional order cancellation after a shipment has taken place. The customer then has to send the items back to you directly. For further information about creating a return in plentymarkets and resetting the outgoing items again, refer to the <<stock-management/outgoing-items#, Booking items out>> page of the manual.
====

[.subhead]
MFN: Manually reversing with Seller Central

Since Amazon received the customer's payment on your behalf, the reversal also has to take place via Amazon. You also have to take care of this in the order folder in Seller Central.

[IMPORTANT]
.Carrying out a reversal manually or with the help of an event procedure
====
The interface does not automatically trigger the refund of the purchase price with Amazon. Rather, this has to be carried out manually or automatically with the help of an event procedure. If you forget to manually refund the sum or if you forget to set up an event procedure for automatically refunding the purchase price, you risk a customer complaint with Amazon and negative feedback.
====

MFN returns (= shipment by the seller) can be reported to Amazon in form of credit notes with an event procedure. Returns for Amazon can only be created for orders of the type credit note. Proceed as described below.

[.subhead]
Creating order statuses

First, create an order status for Amazon returns in the *Setup » Orders » Status* menu, for example [9.6] Return sent to Amazon. You need this order status for the Amazon settings.

[.subhead]
Setting the order status

Set this order status in the Amazon settings as described below.

[.instruction]
Setting an order status for returns:

. Go to *Setup » Markets » Amazon » Settings*.
. Select the Amazon account.
. Click on the *Order settings* tab.
. For the option *Status for transmitted returns*, select the order status that you previously created for Amazon returns.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

Set up an <<automation/event-procedures#, event procedure>> to automatically send returns in form of credit notes to Amazon.

[.collapseBox]
.Setting up an event procedure
--
. Go to *Setup » Orders » Events*.
. Click on *Add event procedure* (icon:plus-square[role="green"]). +
→ The *Create new event procedure* window opens.
. Enter a name.
. Select the *event* listed in <<event-procedure-automatic-return>>.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings. +
→ The event is created.
. Carry out the settings as described in <<event-procedure-automatic-return>>.
. Place a check mark next to the option *Active*.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings. +
→ The event procedure is saved.
--

[TIP]
.Event procedures and credit note import
====
Use event procedures to initiate refunds in plentymarkets. The automatic credit note import (option "Credit note import" in the order settings) ensures that credit notes are not duplicated in your system. If you manually create credit notes or have them created by a third-party system and there are no credit notes in your plentymarkets system, a credit note is created during the import.

[IMPORTANT]
.Filter for the Amazon referrer
====
Do not select an Amazon FBA referrer such as Amazon FBA Germany for the *Order > Referrer* filter if you use the automatic credit note import.
====

[#3100]
=== Importing pending orders from Amazon

Pending orders are imported in status *[1] Incomplete data* into your plentymarkets system and remain there until Amazon approves the orders. Until the approval, no addresses or prices will be saved for the order. After the approval by Amazon, the order is updated and adresses and prices are saved. The automatic stock update decides in which status the order is placed.

If Amazon does not approve the order, the order is not updated, but instead automatically set to status *[8] Cancelled*.

== Activating Amazon VCS in plentymarkets

[IMPORTANT]
.Activate Amazon VCS in the Seller Central
====
First activate Amazon VCS in the Amazon Seller Central before activating it in your plentymarkets system.
====

[IMPORTANT]
.Do not use Amazon VCS and IDU at the same time
====
If you use Amazon VCS, you must not use <<Uploading your own invoices to Amazon, Amazon IDU>> because in this case, invoice documents would be uploaded to Amazon twice. This can result in missing invoices in the Seller Central due to throttling.
====

Amazon VCS is the VAT calculation service offered by Amazon. With this service, Amazon calculates the sales tax.  You decide whether Amazon invoices should be generated by Amazon or by plentymarkets. If you have plentymarkets create Amazon invoices, then the invoices are automatically transferred to Amazon. +

Activate Amazon VCS in plentymarkets in the *Initial settings* section of the *Setup » Markets » Amazon » Select an Amazon account » Tab: Settings* menu.

[IMPORTANT]
.Invoices cannot be generated in other ways
====
Note that Amazon invoices cannot be generated in other ways (e.g. manually or with an event procedure) once you activate the options *VCS plentymarkets* or *VCS Amazon*.
====

[TIP]
.Best practice for Amazon VCS
====
Also read the <<markets/amazon/amazon-setup#markets/amazon/best-practices-amazon-vcs, best practice for Amazon VCS>> which contains further information about the setup of Amazon’s invoice service VCS in plentymarkets.
====

[.instruction]
Activating the invoice service Amazon VCS in plentymarkets:

. Go to *Setup » Markets » Amazon » Select an Amazon account » Tab: Settings*. +
→ *Important:* You first have to activate the invoice service in the Amazon Seller Central before carrying out the settings in plentymarkets.
. Select an option for the *Generate invoice* setting. Pay attention to the explanations given in <<amazon-vcs>>.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

|*Condition:* Amazon VCS is used. +
Amazon invoices are generated by Amazon. Amazon invoices and credit notes are imported into plentymarkets. +
*Important:* If you activate this option, then Amazon invoices *cannot* be created manually or with an event procedure any longer.
|====

[#3175]
== Uploading your own invoices to Amazon

You can upload the invoice documents that were created in plentymarkets to Amazon (Amazon Invoice Document Uploader - IDU) if you do not use Amazon VCS.  To upload your invoices to Amazon, create an event procedure in the *Setup » Orders » Events* menu. +

You can upload invoices created by plentymarkets as well as invoices created with an external software to Amazon. However, invoices created by plentymarkets always take priority over external invoices. This means that all invoice documents will be checked and invoices created by plentymarkets will be uploaded first if available. If there is no plentymarkets invoice, the external invoice will be uploaded to Amazon.

[IMPORTANT]
.Do not use Amazon IDU and VCS at the same time
====
If you use Amazon IDU, you must not use <<Activating Amazon VCS in plentymarkets, Amazon VCS>> because in this case, invoice documents would be uploaded to Amazon twice. This can result in missing invoices in the Seller Central due to throttling.
====

[TIP]
.Send shipping confirmation first
====
Note that you can only upload an invoice to Amazon after a shipping confirmation was sent to Amazon.

== Using the Amazon gift service

By activating the Amazon gift service, your customers can choose to have their items gift wrapped and they can leave a gift message during the order process on Amazon. These options are transferred to plentymarkets when orders are automatically retrieved. No additional settings need to be carried out. Each order item containing gift options has an additional line of information with the ID *-2* added to it directly behind the actual ordered item. It includes the type of packaging as well as the greeting.

Activate the gift options in Amazon Seller Central in order to use the gift service.

[TIP]
.Tip: Multiple types of packaging and surcharges
====
You can add various types of packaging and define surcharges.
====

[#3300]
== Using the FBA service by Amazon

The abbreviation FBA stands for Fulfilment by Amazon. Instead of dealing with the orders yourself, packaging the items and sending them, you let Amazon take care of this task for you with the FBA programme. Of course, you then have to store at least some of your items with Amazon.

[#3400]
=== Creating a warehouse for Amazon FBA

Go to *Setup » Markets » Amazon » Settings » Tab: Order settings* and use the *Warehouse* option to select which warehouse you would like to use for Amazon fulfilment orders. This way, you can be sure that the complete range of stock management functions remain intact with the FBA programme and that you can keep track of the stock at Amazon in your plentymarkets system.

[.instruction]
Creating a warehouse:

. Go to *Setup » Stock » Warehouse*.
. Click on *New account*.
. Enter a name for the warehouse.
. Select a *Warehouse type*.
. Select *Amazon* as *Logistics type*.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings to create the warehouse. +
→ The warehouse is listed in the overview in alphabetical order and opened.
. Carry out further settings according to the explanations on the <<stock-management/setting-up-a-warehouse#, Setting up a warehouse>> page of the manual.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

Only you can decide whether the advantages tied to the FBA service outweigh the disadvantages for your personal situation as an online seller. Here we would only like to make reference to a few important points:

*  Amazon processes orders quickly and reliably. Peak times before Christmas run just as smoothly for store owners as the summer slump while most people are away on vacation.
*  Your listing on the market improves noticeably. You can expect higher sales figures.
*  The FBA service is subject to costs. Naturally, your gross margin will decrease. When doing a comprehensive comparison of the costs, keep in mind that the FBA service includes the expenses tied to storage, handling orders, customer service etc. and as such, relieves you from these expenditures.
*  Generally, items that are stored with Amazon can only be offered there as well. You need to have separate stock for other markets. Amazon's Multi-Channel fulfilment service, however, is a variation that provides you with additional possibilities in this matter.
*  You have much less stress with deliveries that cannot be sent or that are delayed. Packages with the Amazon logo are generally given priority.

[#3500]
=== FBA order import

Proceed as follows to define that your FBA orders are automatically imported in your plentymarkets system once a day.

[.instruction]
Automatically importing FBA orders:

. Go to *Setup » Markets » Amazon » Settings*.
. Select the account.
. Click on the *Order settings* tab.
. Place a check mark next to the option *Active* in the *Amazon FBA* section.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

Order processing has the following steps:

*  The customer makes a purchase on Amazon.
*  Amazon sends the items.
*  The plentymarkets system requests a report.
*  Amazon creates the report.
*  The next day, plentymarkets automatically checks whether any Amazon reports exist. If yes, then these reports are imported.
*  Orders are generated in plentymarkets from the information contained in these reports.

[IMPORTANT]
.Note regarding the order import
====
Amazon only generates the list of orders once per day. Since it can take up to 2 days before an item is ready for shipping, FBA orders are available in your system with a time delay. Generally, the order confirmation that was generated by Amazon is available in your system two days after the item was shipped or a total of up to 4 days after it was ordered. The punctuality of the deliveries, however, is not affected. They will be carried out with the quickness that is customary for Amazon.
====

Amazon FBA orders are imported with the parameters *Status* and *Referrer*. Select the *Status* that is most appropriate for your process. For example, this could be status *[7] Outgoing items booked*. The referrer is automatically set to Amazon FBA or an Amazon FBA sub-referrer, e.g. Amazon FBA USA. The date when items are shipped is saved directly in plentymarkets. Therefore, stock is not reserved for items that are included in the order.

[TIP]
.Event procedures for fulfilment
====
Configure the event procedures that are necessary for the fulfilment process. Such event procedures are having invoices generated and sent to your customers with the help of automatic emails, and having the order then switch to another status. +
For further information, refer to the <<automation/event-procedures#, Event procedures>> and <<fulfilment#, Fulfilment>> pages of the manual.
====

[.subhead]
FBA partial deliveries

Amazon will send FBA partial deliveries if the items ordered by the customer are stored in separate warehouses.
Hence, the customer receives multiple packages for one order. +
In plentymarkets, each FBA partial delivery is saved as a separate order, depending on the FBA warehouse which sends the item. You can import one tracking number from Amazon for each partial delivery and then assign it to the according partial delivery. You can generate a separate invoice for each partial delivery. This is necessary if the Amazon warehouses are located in different countries due to differing taxes.

[.subhead]
European Fulfilment Network (EFN)

Amazon is continuously expanding its European Fulfilment Network for sellers who use shipment by Amazon. In order to use this network, it is required that you are fiscally registered in all countries in which you use FBA logistics centres. In order for your invoices to be generated correctly for these new logistics centres from the fiscal point of view, you can - in addition to your company location - select the warehouse location as basis for the default VAT rate. You can carry out these settings for each client (store) in the *Setup » Client » Select client » Locations » Select location » Accounting* menu. In the *VAT rates* tab, you save the necessary tax rates for the countries.

[TIP]
.Example: Logistics centre is located in Poland and items are shipped to Germany
====
To avoid that the Polish tax rate is used for orders that are shipped to Germany from a logistics centre in Poland, you also have to enter the country Germany with the German tax rate for the location Poland. To do so, go to *Setup » Client » Select client » Locations » Poland » Accounting » Tab: VAT rates*, select the country *Germany* and enter the German tax rate as well as the valid VAT number.
====

[#3600]
=== Automatically importing FBA returns

In case of a return, the purchaser sends the items back to Amazon. The return is imported into your plentymarkets system and listed in the order menu. It is given the return status that you selected in the *Setup » Orders » Settings* menu.

[IMPORTANT]
.Do not change the order
====
Returns will only be imported if the order exists in plentymarkets and its external order number was not changed.
====

Activate the import function as described below in order to automatically import FBA returns in your plentymarkets system.

[.instruction]
Activating the import function for FBA returns:

. Go to *Setup » Markets » Amazon » Settings*.
. Select the Amazon account.
. Click on the *Order settings* tab.
. Select the setting *Daily* from the *Returns import* drop-down list in the *Shipment by Amazon (FBA)* section.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

[#3650]
=== Automatically importing FBA credit notes:

Use the credit note import in order to automatically import FBA credit notes into your plentymarkets system. The credit notes are imported with the status which you have selected for the *Standard status for credit note* setting in the *Setup » Orders » Settings* menu. If you activate the credit note import, then FBA credit notes are imported into your plentymarkets system every 4 hours.

[IMPORTANT]
.Do not import FBA returns as credit notes via an event procedure
====
If you activate the credit note import, FBA credit notes are automatically imported into your plentymarkets system every 4 hours. Therefore, in this case do not use an event procedure to create credit notes from FBA returns.
====

[.instruction]
Activating the automatic credit note import:

. Go to *Setup » Markets » Amazon » Settings*.
. Select the Amazon account.
. Click on the *Order settings* tab.
. Select *Yes* for the *Credit note import* option.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

[#3700]
== Setting up Amazon Multi-Channel

Amazon Multi-Channel Fulfillment is a service that enables you to fulfill orders from sales channels other than Amazon.com using the inventory that you have stored in the Amazon fulfillment center (source: Amazon).

In other words, the Multi-Channel function allows you to store your items with Amazon and have Amazon ship your items even though you sell these items on external markets. This chapter describes which settings you have to carry out in your plentymarkets system so that these orders can be processed by Amazon.

The following steps are necessary to configure your stock and item data for Amazon Multi-Channel.

[#3800]
=== Creating a warehouse for Amazon Multi-Channel

Create a warehouse, if you have not yet created one as described in the <<Using the FBA service by Amazon, Using the FBA service by Amazon>> chapter. When using Multi-Channel fulfilment, it is important to set up a warehouse for each country-specific Amazon marketplace with the logistics type *Amazon* and the country as its location.

[IMPORTANT]
.Example of matching Amazon platform and warehouse location
====
Multi-Channel fulfilment takes place via amazon.co.uk. Create a new warehouse Amazon UK with the logistics type *Amazon* and the location Great Britain. The items must actually be stored with Amazon in that country e.g. in Great Britain. Otherwise they cannot be handled and shipped by amazon.co.uk.
