The abbreviation FBA stands for Fulfilment by Amazon, a service from Amazon where Amazon takes care of the entire stock management and logistics.

[#100]
==  Registering with Amazon

Before carrying out the settings in plentymarkets, you have to register as a seller on Amazon. Amazon Seller Central is the central Amazon interface for sellers. On the Amazon UK platform, sellers who sell more than 35 items per month are considered Pro sellers and only have the possibility to upload item lists from this amount on. plentymarkets users need to select the Pro option. It is only possible to use automatic procedures and APIs to manage stock and offers with the Pro option. This option includes a monthly subscription fee as well as additional fees for each item sold. For further information, refer to the link:https://services.amazon.co.uk/services/sell-online/pricing.html[Amazon website^]{nbsp}icon:external-link[].

[discrete]
===== MWS authorisation

Once you have registered, set up the MWS interface on Amazon. MWS stands for Marketplace Web Service. This service supports API functions. As such, it needs to be set up in order to exchange data with plentymarkets.

Open this link:https://sellercentral.amazon.de/apps/manage[link^]{nbsp}icon:external-link[] and click on *Authorise a developer* to authorise plentymarkets as developer and to allow access to your account. You need the following information for the interface:

*  Developer Nickname: plentymarkets
*  Developer ID for European markets: 6860-7675-7360
*  Developer ID for the US market: 5751-6263-3716

Once you have set up Amazon MWS, you will receive the merchant ID that you need for setting up the interface in plentymarkets.

How to set up the MWS interface at Amazon is also explained in this video tutorial:

Use the *Amazon Basic settings* assistant in the *Setup » Assistants » Omni-Channel* menu to set up your Amazon account in plentymarkets quickly and easily. Moreover, you can carry out settings for the data transfer and for Amazon MFN and Amazon FBA with this assistant.
====

[#300]
===  Setting up an account

Set up a new Amazon account in plentymarkets.

[.instruction]
Creating a new account:

[TIP]
.European Marketplaces Account
====
"Amazon has unified its European marketplaces, allowing you to create and manage product offers on any and all of our Amazon marketplaces in the UK, France, Germany, Spain and Italy. You control what you sell and where. You manage your business from a single seller account interface. When you sign up to sell on Amazon.co.uk, your seller account is automatically enabled to allow you to sell on Amazon.de, Amazon.fr, Amazon.es and Amazon.it. You will be asked to define your home marketplace which can be any of the 4 marketplaces. We recommend that you choose your home marketplace as the country from where you will be operating and fulfilling your orders." (Source: Amazon) +
Refer to Amazon’s link:https://services.amazon.co.uk/services/sell-online/international-selling.html[information^]{nbsp}icon:external-link[] about the European Marketplaces Account.
====

[#350]
[discrete]
===== Amazon platform

If you sell on multiple Amazon platforms with a European Marketplaces Account, then set up a new account for each platform in plentymarkets, depending on which options you want to use, and configure each platform separately. Set up separate accounts for the price synchronisation, the item data export and the import of pending orders. For example, if you only want to use stock synchronisation, do not create a separate account for each country platform. +
The same access data is used for all platforms.

[TIP]
.Amazon platforms
====
With plentymarkets, you can sell on the Amazon platforms Amazon.de, Amazon.co.uk, Amazon.fr, Amazon.it, Amazon.es, Amazon.nl, Amazon.com, Amazon.ca, and Amazon.com.mx.
====

[#400]
===  Carrying out the initial settings

All entries in the *Access data* area of the *Settings* tab are mandatory entries. Enter the data and pay attention to the explanations given in <<#settings-access-data>>.

[[settings-access-data]]
.Settings for *Access data*
[cols="1,3"]
|====
| Setting | Explanation

| *Amazon platform*
| A platform has to be selected when the account is created. However, the platform can be changed here. If you have a European Marketplaces Account, then you can carry out the settings for each platform on which you want to offer your products separately. For further information, refer to the section <<Setting up an account, Amazon platform>>.

| *Seller ID*
| Enter the seller ID that you have received from Amazon. If you have a European Marketplaces Account, then the same seller ID is used for every platform.

| *Merchant token*
| Enter the merchant token that you can find on Seller Central.

| *Email address*
| Enter the email address that is used as user name for the Seller Central account.

| *Active*
| Activate the interface. +
Only activate once all of the settings have been carried out. This prevents incorrect data from accidentally being transferred.

| *B2B*
| Select to activate this account for Amazon Business.
|====

Carry out settings that relate to the SKU structure in the *Initial settings* area. The SKU (Stock Keeping Unit) is a unique reference number for all items and item variations on Amazon.

[[tab-initial-settings]]
.Settings in the *Initial settings* tab
[cols="1,3"]
|====
| Setting | Explanation

| *Client*
| Select which client should be used for orders from Amazon.

| *SKU structure*
| Select one of the following options: +
*Variation ID* +
*GTIN if available, otherwise variation ID* +
*Variation number if available, otherwise variation ID* +
The selected setting only goes into effect for items that are exported to Amazon for the first time. Amazon and your online store exchange data based on these SKUs. +
*Important:* Do not change this setting after items have been transferred to Amazon. If you do so, communication, e.g. stock updates, between plentymarkets and Amazon will no longer be possible. +
Pay attention to the note below the table with the title *Assigning already existing SKU numbers*.

| *Catalogue was listed with SSW*
| *Yes* = Items are listed on Amazon with link:https://www.starsellersworld.com/[starsellersworld^]{nbsp}icon:external-link[]. The item SKU will be cut off right behind the last "-" when importing the items. This makes it possible to match the item in the system. +
*No* = Items are not listed on Amazon with starsellersworld.

| *Generate invoice*
|Select whether invoices should be generated by plentymarkets or by Amazon. See <<#6800, Setting up invoice generation for Amazon orders>>. +
*_Note:_* If you want to use Amazon Business, activate the option *VCS plentymarkets* (VCS Lite) or *VCS Amazon*. +
*plentymarkets* = plentymarkets calculates the VAT and generates the invoice. You set up an event procedure which uploads the invoices to Amazon via Amazon IDU. See <<#3175, Setting up Amazon IDU>>. +
*VCS plentymarkets* (VCS Lite) = Amazon invoices are automatically generated by plentymarkets and transferred to Amazon. Amazon calculates the VAT. Amazon calls this option VCS Lite. See <<#3150, Setting up VCS plentymarkets>>. +
*_Note:_* VCS must be activated in Amazon Seller Central. +
*VCS Amazon* = Invoices for Amazon orders are generated by Amazon. +
Invoices for Amazon orders and credit notes are imported into plentymarkets. See <<#6900, Setting up VCS Amazon>>. +
*_Note:_* VCS must be activated in Amazon Seller Central.
|====

[TIP]
.SKU settings and stock synchronisation
====
If the same settings for SKU numbers are selected for all platforms, then you can synchronise all platforms for the European Marketplaces Account with the stock synchronisation. If the settings are not the same, then the synchronisation must be carried out separately for each platform.

Because the stock is managed globally for a European Marketplaces Account, it is sufficient to activate the stock for your home marketplace. Nevertheless, the SKU settings must match.
====

[IMPORTANT]
.Assigning already existing SKU numbers
====
If you have already started selling your items on Amazon and now you want to start selling them with plentymarkets, you have to assign already existing SKUs in the *Item » Edit item » Open item » Tab: Variation ID » Tab: Settings » Tab: Availability* menu.
====

[IMPORTANT]
.Authorising plentymarkets email addresses
====
All plentymarkets email addresses which are used to send messages to Amazon have to be authorised first within your Seller Central account on Amazon.
====

[#500]
===  Carrying out item settings

In the *Item settings* tab, you carry out settings related to the item export. For example, you can configure automatic processes and export filters. If you use export filters, then only items with the selected filters are exported.

In order to transfer special offers to Amazon, create an additional sales price with the price type *Special offer* and link it to the item. In addition, the characteristics *SaleStartDate* and *SaleEndDate* have to be created and linked to the item. Proceed as described below to define special offers for Amazon items.

[.instruction]
Defining a special offer for Amazon platforms:

. Go to *Setup » Item » Sales prices » Open sales price » Tab: Settings*.
. In the row *Price type*, activate the setting *Special offer*.

. Enter the desired names into the *Internal name* and *External name* fields. +
→ If these fields are not filled, the price will not be taken into consideration.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

Next, you have to link the special offer to the item in the *Item » Edit item » Open item » Tab: Variation ID » Tab: Settings* menu.

Next, create the characteristics *SaleStartDate* and *SaleEndDate* and link them with the Amazon product type. Proceed as described below to create and link the characteristic *SaleStartDate*. Create the characteristic *SaleEndDate* in the same way but enter the name *SaleEndDate* and link the Amazon field *sale_end_date* instead.

[.instruction]
Creating a characteristic for special offers and linking it with the Amazon product type:

. Go to *Setup » Item » Characteristics » Tab: New characteristic*.
. Enter *SaleStartDate* for *Name (internal)*. +

== Linking categories

include::_textblocks/instructions/amz-link-categories.adoc[]

[#1350]
== Linking attributes and attribute values

<<item/managing-items#390, Attributes>> also have to be linked before your items can be transferred to Amazon. It is also possible to link attributes for several languages.

[.instruction]
Linking attributes and attribute values:

. Go to *Setup » Item » Attributes*. +
→ The overview of all attributes used in your catalogue opens.
. Open an attribute.
. Click on the *Attribute link* tab.
. Click on *Amazon*.  +
→ The Amazon area for the attribute link is displayed.

If the second column is empty, *footwear_size* is filled with the value entered in the first column.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.
. Repeat this process for all remaining attributes.

Next, activate the attributes within the item settings.

[IMPORTANT]
.Deactivate main variation without an attribute link
====
If an item's variations have attribute links but the main variation has none, then the main variation has to be set to inactive. Otherwise, the main variation will be exported as a single item. The main variation must be activated if it has an attribute link.
====

[#1390]
== Linking properties with Amazon

Use <<item/settings/properties#500, properties>> to define individual features of a variation. For example, you can use properties to highlight a variation’s technical features, such as Bluetooth or WLAN.

Link properties that you have created in the *Setup » Settings » Properties » Configuration* and added to a variation with Amazon in the *Setup » Settings » Properties » Configuration » _Open the property_ » Tab: Amazon* menu.

[IMPORTANT]
.Properties are prioritised over characteristics
====
If you linked a characteristic and a property with the same Amazon field, then the property is prioritised over the characteristic. The characteristic is overwritten by the property during the item export.
====

[.instruction]
Linking a property with Amazon:

[#1400]
== Linking characteristics with Amazon

In case you ever need to define the parameters or characteristics of items for Amazon which cannot directly be set up with plentymarkets, we have developed the solution that is described here: Parameters or values are integrated by means of the characteristics.

The item’s characteristic and the Amazon product type are linked in the *Setup » Item » Characteristics* menu. In plentymarkets, you can save a maximum of 16 links for one characteristic.

[.instruction]
Linking characteristics with the Amazon product type:

. Go to *Setup » Item » Characteristics*.
. Expand (icon:plus-square-o[]) the characteristic that you want to use for Amazon. +
→ The characteristic's editing area opens.
. Select the category from the *Amazon link* drop-down list. +
→ A new drop-down list appears.
. Select the Amazon field from the drop-down list.
. Click on *Add* (icon:plus-square[role="green"]). +
→ The link is created.

[TIP]
.Tip: Characteristic type “selection”
====
All characteristic types can be used for the Amazon link. Characteristics of the types *Selection* and *Text* can be used to transfer multilingual characteristics.
====

[discrete]
===== Activating a characteristic for an item

[#1500]
== Activating the data exchange

This chapter describes the settings that need to be configured in order to exchange data between your plentymarkets system and Amazon. First, you will learn how to export all of the relevant data about your items and stock. Second, you will learn how to automatically import Amazon orders via the XML interface and how to manually import them with a CSV file. Third, you will learn how to send shipping confirmations to Amazon, how to synchronise FBA stock and how to reset order reports from Amazon.

[#1600]
=== Exporting item data

In the *Setup » Markets » Amazon » Data exchange » Data export* menu, two data exports can be generated. On the one hand, the data export Seller Central which contains all relevant information about your items and stock and which can then be uploaded directly into Seller Central. On the other hand, the data export Marketplace which you can use to export item data for the BMVD categories on Amazon.

[#1700]
==== Setting up the data export Seller Central

Use the *Seller Central* area of this menu to manually generate a data export that contains all relevant information about items and stock and that can be uploaded directly to Amazon Seller Central. Proceed as described below.

[IMPORTANT]

=== Importing Amazon orders

Go to *Setup » Markets » Amazon » Data exchange » Order import* to set up the import of Amazon orders. Orders can be imported automatically via the XML interface or they can be imported manually with a .txt file. Both possibilities are described below.

[#2000]
==== Automatically importing orders

Proceed as follows to set up the automatic order import.

[.instruction]
Setting up the automatic order import:

. Click on the *gear-wheel icon* to carry out the import.

[TIP]
.Tip: Imported orders
====
If orders are imported from Amazon that you did not upload with plentymarkets and/or that contain items which have not yet been created in plentymarkets, then you can manually assign the items for these orders and set the corresponding status.
====

[IMPORTANT]
.Missing invoice address
====
If the invoice address is missing from the orders that were retrieved from Amazon, then contact the Amazon support. Amazon has to carry out this setting.
====

[TIP]
.Original currency and standard currency are different
====
Additional information is saved for orders that are imported with a different currency than the standard currency saved in plentymarkets. In this case, both the original currency and the original gross and net amounts are saved for every item included in the order.
====

[#2200]
=== Sending shipping confirmations to Amazon

As soon as the Amazon order was processed in your plentymarkets system and the goods were shipped, you have to inform Amazon of the new status so that the sales figures can be credited to your account. Your plentymarkets system automatically takes care of this important step via the interface as well.

Orders have to meet the following requirements in order for the shipping confirmation to be sent to Amazon:

*  *Referrer:* Amazon or an Amazon sub-referrer
*  Status range 7 (less than 8)
*  External order number
*  Imported order (not created manually)
*  Outgoing items booked (time must not be in the future)

If the shipping confirmation is not automatically transferred, e.g. because the servers are temporarily unavailable, or if you want orders to be manually confirmed shortly before an accounting deadline, so that they will still be taken into consideration during the next payment, then you can also transfer shipping confirmations manually to Amazon. No shipping confirmation is sent to Amazon for Prime orders (Amazon_Prime, Amazon_PrimeSame_Day, Amazon_Prime_NextDay, and Amazon_Prime_SecondDay).
[.instruction]
Manually sending shipping confirmations to Amazon:

. Go to *Setup » Markets » Amazon » Data exchange » Shipping confirmation*.
. Select an Amazon account from the drop-down list.
. Enter a date next to *Items shipped on*. +
→ All of the outgoing items from this date are transmitted to Amazon.
. Click on *Send shipping confirmation*.

[#2300]
=== Editing Amazon order reports

In the *Setup » Markets » Amazon » Data exchange » Reports* menu, you can define intervals for Amazon order reports and reset Amazon order reports from a specific date.

[#2350]
==== Setting intervals for order reports

Go to *Setup » Markets » Amazon » Data exchange » Reports » Tab: Scheduled reports* to define the interval in which order reports should be created by Amazon. Orders from these reports are imported during the automatic order import. Therefore, we recommend to use a low interval both for the generation of reports as well as for the order import. +
MFN order reports can be identified by the name *GET ORDERS DATA*. +

Additionally, you can retrieve tax reports and define an interval for the retrieval of FBA order reports in this menu. +

In order to create tax reports for Amazon Business, define an interval under *Tax reports*. Retrieve the tax reports for Amazon Business in the Amazon Seller Central. If you define an interval for the generation of tax reports in your plentymarkets system, you do not need to carry out any further settings in the Seller Central. +

If you activated Amazon FBA in the *Setup » Markets » Amazon » Settings » Tab: Order settings* menu, FBA order reports are automatically retrieved every 4 hours. In the *FBA orders* area, you can optionally define an interval for the retrieval of order reports.

[.instruction]
Defining an interval:

. Go to *Setup » Markets » Amazon » Data exchange » Reports » Tab: Scheduled reports*.
. Select an Amazon account from the drop-down list.
. Select an interval for the generation of order reports.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

[#2360]
==== Resetting order reports

In the *Setup » Markets » Amazon » Data exchange » Reports » Tab: MFN reports* menu, you can reset the Amazon order reports from a specific date.

If you reset order reports from a specific date, then these order reports will once again become available for import. When carrying out the import again, only the missing orders from this date are imported. This is done by synchronising the Amazon transaction number. If a transaction number already exists, then the order is not imported again. This ensures that orders are not duplicated.

[.instruction]
Resetting MFN reports:

. Go to *Setup » Markets » Amazon » Data exchange » Reports » Tab: MFN reports*.
. Select an Amazon account from the drop-down list.
. Select a date for which you would like to reset the MFN reports.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

[#2400]
=== Synchronising stock

Stock is synchronised with Amazon in the *Setup » Markets » Amazon » Data exchange » FBA stock* menu. There are a few different ways to do this. You can use the hourly automatic stock synchronisation, an automatic procedure or a CSV file.

[IMPORTANT]
.Only for Amazon Multi-Channel
====
This feature is intended for <<Setting up Amazon Multi-Channel, Amazon Multi-Channel>> only.
====

In plentymarkets, a distinction is made between automatic stock synchronisation and manual stock synchronisation. Both procedures are described below.

[#2500]
==== Automatically synchronising stock

Proceed as follows to automatically synchronise stock.

[.instruction]
Automatically synchronising stock:

. Go to *Setup » Markets » Amazon » Data exchange » FBA stock*.
. Select the Amazon account in the *Automatically* tab.
. Click on *Synchronise Amazon FBA stock*.

4 minutes are allotted for this process. If Amazon does not provide the data within this time frame, then stock is not synchronised. The next request will use the previous data that was not transferred. This can lead to errors. Therefore, we recommend that you manually synchronise data with a CSV file as described in the next chapter.

Stock information is only synchronised for those items that had their stock changed on Amazon in the last 30 days. We recommend that you use the manual synchronisation for the first import. The stock is synchronised according to the <<Carrying out the initial settings, initial settings>> in plentymarkets.

[#2600]
==== Manually synchronising stock

Stock is synchronised manually via CSV file.

[IMPORTANT]
.Assigning SKU numbers
====
If you want to manually synchronise data, then you also have to specify how SKU numbers should be assigned to the stock. This is specified in the <<Carrying out the initial settings, initial settings>>.
====

Before you carry out this synchronisation, you have to request the corresponding report file from Amazon in Seller Central. Download this CSV file and save it on your computer.

[.instruction]
Manually synchronising stock:

. Go to *Setup » Markets » Amazon » Data exchange » FBA stock*.
. Click on the *Manual* tab.
. Select the Amazon account.
. Click on *Select file* to select the CSV file that you have just saved.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings to carry out the synchronisation.

[#2700]
== Retrieving Amazon orders

Anyone who has worked with another shop system in the past can certainly remember just how time-consuming daily order processing in the Seller Central portal can be. All that is made significantly easier with plentymarkets. Here, all orders from all connected markets are collected together into one order folder. Amazon orders automatically become plentymarkets orders, which you can quickly and effectively work with according to the fulfilment procedure that you are accustomed to. You do not even have to worry about the order import. The interface takes care of that for you in the background. A few requirements have to be fulfilled so that everything works correctly. These are summarised in the following.

Orders are retrieved every 15 minutes. However, in some cases it can take up to 90 minutes until an order that was generated in Amazon will appear in your plentymarkets system. That is not a malfunction, but rather is the only possibility due to technical reasons. Usually, an email from Amazon informs you about the sale beforehand and you can already see the order in Seller Central.

[#2800]
=== Carrying out settings for the interface in plentymarkets

The basic settings *Incoming payment* and *Shipping confirmation* are relevant for importing orders. We assume that you transfer orders with the status *[5] cleared for shipping* and that you let the daily shipping confirmation be generated automatically by your plentymarkets system. Check these settings once again.

For further information about manual and automatic order import, refer to the <<FBA order import, FBA order import>> chapter.

[IMPORTANT]
.Editing returns for Amazon orders
====
Even with Amazon, you have to anticipate the occasional order cancellation after a shipment has taken place. The customer then has to send the items back to you directly. For further information about creating a return in plentymarkets and resetting the outgoing items again, refer to the <<stock-management/outgoing-items#, Booking items out>> page of the manual.
====

[discrete]
===== MFN: Manually reversing with Seller Central

Since Amazon received the customer's payment on your behalf, the reversal also has to take place via Amazon. You also have to take care of this in the order folder in Seller Central.

[IMPORTANT]
.Carrying out a reversal manually or with the help of an event procedure
====
The interface does not automatically trigger the refund of the purchase price with Amazon. Rather, this has to be carried out manually or automatically with the help of an event procedure. If you forget to manually refund the sum or if you forget to set up an event procedure for automatically refunding the purchase price, you risk a customer complaint with Amazon and negative feedback.
====

MFN returns (= shipment by the seller) can be reported to Amazon in form of credit notes with an event procedure. Returns for Amazon can only be created for orders of the type credit note. Proceed as described below.

[discrete]
===== Creating order statuses

First, create an order status for Amazon returns in the *Setup » Orders » Status* menu, for example [9.6] Return sent to Amazon. You need this order status for the Amazon settings.

[discrete]
===== Setting the order status

Set this order status in the Amazon settings as described below.

[.instruction]
Setting an order status for returns:

. Go to *Setup » Markets » Amazon » Settings*.
. Select the Amazon account.
. Click on the *Order settings* tab.
. For the option *Status for transmitted returns*, select the order status that you previously created for Amazon returns.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

Set up an <<automation/event-procedures#, event procedure>> to automatically send returns in form of credit notes to Amazon.

:table-event-procedure: <<#event-procedure-automatic-return>>

include::../../_includes/textblocks/instructions/EA.adoc[]

[TIP]
.Event procedures and credit note import
====
Use event procedures to initiate refunds in plentymarkets. The automatic credit note import (option "Credit note import" in the order settings) ensures that credit notes are not duplicated in your system. If you manually create credit notes or have them created by a third-party system and there are no credit notes in your plentymarkets system, a credit note is created during the import.

[IMPORTANT]
.Filter for the Amazon referrer
====
Do not select an Amazon FBA referrer such as Amazon FBA Germany for the *Order > Referrer* filter if you use the automatic credit note import.
====

[#3100]
=== Importing pending orders from Amazon

Pending orders are imported in status *[1] Incomplete data* into your plentymarkets system and remain there until Amazon approves the orders. Until the approval, no addresses or prices will be saved for the order. After the approval by Amazon, the order is updated and adresses and prices are saved. The automatic stock update decides in which status the order is placed.

If Amazon does not approve the order, the order is not updated, but instead automatically set to status *[8] Cancelled*.

[#3110]
==== Reserving stock for pending orders

There are two ways to reserve stock for pending orders in plentymarkets. Use an event procedure or the basic settings of an order.
The event procedure is used to put the order from status 1 to a status where stock is reserved.
