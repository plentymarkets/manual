One important aspect of your online store is the selection of payment methods offered. If the right selection is missing, customers could cancel the purchase at the end of the order process or not order in your online store at all. To avoid this, you should find out which payment methods your customers prefer to use. This area of the manual describes how to set up payment methods and payment providers in plentymarkets.
