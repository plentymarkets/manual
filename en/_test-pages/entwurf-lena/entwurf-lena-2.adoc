|Setting |Explanation

|**Delete stock completely**
|This function deletes all stock from the warehouse. Therefore, use this function carefully. +
For further information about deleting stock completely, refer to the **<<stock-management/managing-stocks#, Stocktaking>>** page of the manual.

|**Save**
|Saves the settings.

|**Delete**
|Deletes the warehouse from the system. Before a warehouse can be deleted, all of its **<<_test-pages/entwurf-lena/entwurf-lena-2#2-3-1, racks>>**, **<<_test-pages/entwurf-lena/entwurf-lena-2#2-3-2, shelves>>** and **<<_test-pages/entwurf-lena/entwurf-lena-2#2-3-3, storage locations>>** have to be deleted as well. No **link::/[reorders]** may be available for the warehouse that you want to delete. +
When a warehouse is deleted, all of the data related to the warehouse will be lost, e.g. the incoming items. Therefore, we recommend that you do not delete any warehouses. Rather, switch warehouses that are no longer needed to the warehouse type **Repair warehouse**.

|**Warehouse ID**
|Warehouse ID

|**Warehouse name**
|Name of the warehouse

|**Warehouse type**
|Select a type depending on the function of the warehouse: +
**Sales** = Standard warehouse +
**Repair** = Warehouse for returned items. You can choose to assign this warehouse to a specific **sales** warehouse (see the following option). +
**Storage** = Warehouse for items that are kept in reserve. +
**Transit** = Temporary warehouse for assigning items to the destination address when reloading items from one means of transport to another. +
**Distribution** = Distribution warehouse +
**Other** = Other warehouse +

|**Logistics type**
|Warehouse management +
**Own warehouse** = Own warehouse takes care of the logistics. +
**Amazon** = Items are distributed by Amazon FBA Multi-Channel. +
**DHL Fulfillment** = Items are distributed by DHL Fulfillment. +
**Rhenus** = Items are distributed by Rhenus.

|**Warehouse assigned for repairs**
|Here you can select one of the **repair** warehouses. The repair warehouse is where you want **returned** items to be sent that are in need of repairs. This will let you avoid defective items being mixed together with the normal stock. As soon as the items have been repaired or exchanged, assign them to the distribution warehouse. +
The stock of a repair warehouse can not be transmitted to the online store or other platforms. The stock of a repair warehouse provides an overview about whether or not items are still being repaired. Therefore, the stock can not be sold. +
Create the desired repair warehouse so that it is available in this drop-down list.

|**Priority**
|Determine the priority of the warehouse. From **+** (lowest priority) to **+++++** (highest priority).

|**Split up according to shipping profile**
|For example, if working with **<<order-processing/orders/managing-orders#300, delivery orders>>**, then this option should be set to **Yes** for their creation.

|**Location**
|The location of the warehouse. +
Here, you can select the countries that were set up as countries of delivery under link::/[**System » Orders » Shipping » Settings » Tab: Countries of delivery**].

|**Standard zone**
|The standard zone that you want to have automatically set as default in the warehouse settings, e.g. in the **Warehouse** tab within the item editing window.

|**Standard storage location type**
|The standard storage location type that you want to have automatically set as default in the warehouse settings, e.g. in the **Warehouse** tab within the item editing window.

|**Availability with** and **without stock**
|This option specifies which availability should be displayed when stock is available and when it is not available. This setting takes priority over the configuration that you made for an individual item within its **Available** tab. As such, this setting more precisely specifies how the availability should be displayed. Make sure that you activated the **Automatic availability display** options within the item's **Stock** tab. +
The stock needs to be recalculated after any changes have been made. This is done by going to <<stock-management/managing-stocks#, **Stock » Stocks**>> and clicking on the **Recalculate stocks** button.

|**Note**
|Notes, e.g. information about the warehouse. The content of the old field **Address** was transferred to the **Note** field.

|**Active stocktaking mode**
|Activate the **<<_test-pages/entwurf-lena/entwurf-lena-2#3, stocktaking mode>>** in order to freeze the stock of the warehouse while you are busy taking stock.
