[#priorities-dhl-plugins]
=== Observing the priorities of the DHL plugins

Pay attention to priorities of the two DHL plugins in the *Plugins » Plugin set overview* menu.

In order that this plugin works correctly, it has to be loaded with a certain priority compared to other plugins. If you install the plugin with the help of the Integration assistant, the correct priority is already set. If not, you have to adjust the priority yourself. To do so, open your plugin set and click on *Priority*. Make sure that the DHL Wunschpaket plugin has a higher priority than DHL Shipping (Versenden) and a lower priority than Ceres and IO.

[#dhl-shipping-as-shipping-service-provider]
=== Selecting DHL Shipping (Versenden) as shipping service provider

*DHL Shipping (Versenden)* has to be selected as shipping service provider in the *Setup » Orders » Shipping » Settings* menu in the *Shipping service provider* tab.

[#complete-assistant]
== Completing the assistant

Once you have <<plugins/installing-added-plugins#installing-plugins, installed the plugin in a plugin set>>, the *DHL Wunschpaket* assistant is available in the *Setup » Assistants* menu in the *Integration* area.

Complete the assistant to save a surcharge for the *Preferred day* service, determine the cut-off times that belong to the *Preferred day* service and set the days where no parcels are transferred to DHL. The cut-off time determines up to which time transfer of parcels to DHL is possible at the same day.

DHL offers the services *Preferred neighbour* and *Preferred location* without any additional charge. If your customer selects the *Preferred day* service in the online store, the price you determined for this service is displayed in the order process and added to the order's total sum.

In order that your customers can use the finder in the Ceres online store to search for a <<#dhl-wunschpaket-packstation-postfiliale-finder, DHL packstation or post office>> nearby, you have to enter your Google Maps API key and <<fulfilment/shipping-service-provider-plugins/plugin-dhl-shipping-versenden#dhl-assistant-settings-combination, activate>> the finder in the *DHL Shipping (Versenden): Settings combination* assistant. Furthermore, you can determine whether it is mandatory for your customers to enter the DHL post number for post offices in the finder.
