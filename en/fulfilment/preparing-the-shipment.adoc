Many sellers decide to hire a service provider to ship items on their behalf. Depending on the services that were agreed upon in your contract, the service provider may be hired to pick up the items from your business, send your items and then report the status back to your plentymarkets system.

plentymarkets allows customers to manage their fully customised shipping processes and trigger nearly all processes automatically. Your plentymarkets system efficiently controls the entire shipping process using <<automation/processes/setting-up-processes#, processes>>. It carries out everything from linking items with shipping profiles to registering shipments and printing shipping labels. The initial time that it takes to carry out the settings pays off when you have an efficient shipping process that automatically carries out routine tasks.

This page of the manual describes how you prepare the shipping process and which <<fulfilment/preparing-the-shipment#2500, shipping service provider-specific settings>> you need to carry out. Some service providers offer a complete service which includes storing and packing the items. For further information, refer to the chapter <<fulfilment/preparing-the-shipment#4700, Overview of fulfilment service providers>>.

== Setting up countries of delivery

Set up the countries that you want to ship your items to in the *Setup » Orders » Shipping » Settings* menu in the *Countries of delivery* tab. The overview contains a list of all the countries of delivery that are available in plentymarkets. The country names used in the system are displayed in the column *Standard name*. The standard name cannot be changed and is not visible for your customers. Use the column *Name* to enter the name that you want your customers to see, e.g. an alternative spelling or an abbreviation.

== Creating a region

Regions are groups of countries that have the same shipping costs.

Click on the *New region* tab and create the necessary regions by selecting the countries of delivery that belong to each region. The regions become available and can be edited in the *Overview* tab. Carefully plan which regions you need for grouping together your countries of delivery. This is important because shipping costs are entered into the shipping profiles for each region rather than for each country of delivery. Sellers located in the United Kingdom would likely need the following 3 regions at minimum: United Kingdom, Continental Europe and Worldwide.

[TIP]
.Have you activated the necessary countries of delivery?
====
Make sure that you activated all of the necessary countries of delivery before you create regions. A country of delivery can only be assigned to one region. After it has been assigned, it is no longer available for other regions.
====

[.instruction]
Creating a region:

. Go to *Setup » Orders » Shipping » Settings*.
. Click on the *Regions* tab.
. Click on the *New region* tab. +
→ The *Available countries* column lists all of the countries of delivery that are not yet assigned to any region.
. Select the desired countries of delivery in the *Available countries* column.
. Use the arrows to move these countries of delivery to the *Selected countries* column. +
*_Note:_* Use the double arrow buttons to move all of the countries from one column to the other.
. Enter a name for the region into the *Name* line.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings. +
→ The newly created region is displayed in the *Overview* tab.
. Follow the same pattern to create other regions until all countries of delivery are assigned to a region and the list of *Available countries* is empty.

[IMPORTANT]
.Assign all countries of delivery
====
All countries of delivery have to be assigned to a region. Otherwise, it is not possible to create a valid shipping profile.
====

[IMPORTANT]
.Conditions for deleting a region
====
A region can only be deleted if it is no longer being used in the shipping profiles.

== Creating a shipping profile

The individual shipping profiles are different shipping methods, which your customers can choose later on during checkout or which are assigned automatically to certain types of orders by the online store. For example, you can offer your customers a cheap standard delivery and a more expensive express delivery. You can also set up another shipping profile for eBay listings which the system exclusively uses for orders from the market eBay. Find tips and tricks in the sub-chapters which you can make use of when creating your shipping profiles. Afterwards, it is describes how you create <<fulfilment/preparing-the-shipment#1500, tables of shipping charges>> for every shipping service provider and region.

Now create the shipping profile for the shipping service provider. The number of shipping profiles depends on the required shipping services. Create a different shipping profile for every shipping service.

[.instruction]
Creating a shipping profile:

. Go to *Setup » Orders » Shipping » Settings*.
. Click on the *Shipping profiles* tab.
. Click on *New* (icon:plus-square[role="green"]).
. Select the shipping service provider that you have just created from the drop-down list.
. Carry out the settings. Pay attention to the information given in <<#table-basic-settings-shipping-profile>>.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings. +
→ The *Table of shipping charges* tab is displayed.

[[table-basic-settings-shipping-profile]]
.Creating a new shipping profile
[cols="1,3"]
|====
|Setting |Explanation

|*ID*
|The ID of the shipping profile is assigned by the system and cannot be changed. Once you saved the shipping profile, the ID is displayed in the *Overview* tab.

|*Shipping service provider*
|Select the shipping service provider that you have just created from the drop-down list.

|*Name*
|The name in this field is displayed in the online store. Select a name that should be displayed to the customer, e.g. Standard or Express. If you operate your online store in multiple languages, use the drop-down list to save names for every language that you need.

|*Name (back end)*
|Enter a name for the shipping profile. The name is only displayed in your system. It is not visible for customers.

|*Flag*
|Select an icon that should be displayed in the order overview. The flag indicates which shipping profile is saved at a glance.

|*Priority*
|Determines which shipping profile is displayed first, second, third, etc.

|*Category*
|The category option is another way to prioritise shipping profiles in the shopping cart. Category *1* is selected by default. This means that all of the shipping profiles are given the same priority. Further information can be found in the chapter <<fulfilment/preparing-the-shipment#1300, Tips and tricks: Category>>.

|*Item extra shipping charge*
|Place a check mark to activate the extra shipping charges that are saved in the item data record. Up to 2 extra shipping charges can be saved for the item's main variation in the *Shipping* section. *Extra shipping charge 1* is added to the shipping costs for the first item. *Extra shipping charge 2* is added to the shipping costs for all additional items. Extra shipping charges are useful for large or bulky items that are particularly expensive to ship. +
Further information can be found in the chapter <<fulfilment/preparing-the-shipment#1100, Tips and tricks: Extra shipping charges>>.

|*POSTIDENT*
|Authority verification by the Deutsche Post AG. Serves to verify customers, e.g. in connection with the proof of age for 18+ items. Place a check mark to activate this option. +
Items with an 18+ age rating have to be linked to a shipping profile that the POSTIDENT option was activated for.

|*Activate for new items*
|Activate if you want the shipping profile to automatically be assigned to new items. +
You should select this option for new items for at least one shipping profile. In doing so, new items are always assigned automatically to this shipping profile. An item cannot be shipped if it is not linked to at least one shipping profile.

|*Cash on delivery*
|Activate the option in order that your customer can select the payment method *Cash on delivery* in your online store. +
*_Important:_* Installing the cash on delivery plugin is required. You can find the plugin in the link:https://marketplace.plentymarkets.com/en/plugins/payment/cashondelivery_5255[plentyMarketplace^].

|*Packing station active*
|Activate the option. This allows your customers to enter the field *Packing station* in an optimised way during the Ceres checkout in your online store. +
*_Important:_* It is required that the plugins link:https://marketplace.plentymarkets.com/en/plugins/templates/Ceres_4697[Ceres^] and link:https://marketplace.plentymarkets.com/en/plugins/templates/IO_4696[IO^] are installed.

|*Post office active*
|Activate the option. This allows your customers to enter the field *Post office* in an optimised way during the Ceres checkout in your online store. +
*_Important:_* It is required that the plugins link:https://marketplace.plentymarkets.com/en/plugins/templates/Ceres_4697[Ceres^] and link:https://marketplace.plentymarkets.com/en/plugins/templates/IO_4696[IO^] are installed.

|*Transfer email and telephone number*
|Select whether the email address and the telephone number should be transferred to the shipping service provider or not or whether an alternative value should be transferred. +
*_Note:_* By default, this data is not transferred to the service provider (GDPR conformity).

|*Alternative email*
|This setting is only visible if the option *Transfer alternative* was selected in the drop-down list *Transfer email and telephone number*. Enter the alternative email address that should be transferred to the service provider.

|*Alternative telephone number*
|This setting is only visible if the option *Transfer alternative* was selected in the drop-down list *Transfer email and telephone number*. Enter the alternative telephone number that should be transferred to the service provider.

|*Extra charge for islands*
|Many shipping service providers charge a higher fee when shipping to island regions. The seller should not be left with these costs. Therefore, open each shipping profile and define a surcharge that is added when shipping to island regions. Postcodes for island regions are saved in the system. The order is automatically synchronised. If you activated the extra charge for islands, this charge is only calculated if the system recognises this postcode as an island region. +
The island surcharge applies for each item when using the calculation type *Item shipping charge*.

|*Clients (stores)*
|Choose one of the options or select the option *ALL* if the shipping profile should apply to all online stores. +
This option is only displayed if at least one client (store) is set up.

|*Order referrer*
|Select one or several of the options to determine possible order referrers for this shipping profile. Alternatively, select *ALL* if you want to activate all referrers.

|*Blocked payment methods*
|Select all the payment methods that should not be offered for the shipping profile. If you have shipping profiles that should not include a cash on delivery option, make sure to select all of the options that are used in connection with cash on delivery.

|*Blocked customer classes*
|Block one or more customer classes for the shipping profile.

|*Last change*
|If you make changes to the settings, the date is updated here.

|*Shipping groups*
|If you want to create groups for your shipping profiles, enter a name for a shipping group here and click on *Add*. Enter this name into every shipping profile that should belong to this group. You end up with various groups which contain different shipping profiles. +
*_Example:_* Shipping group A contains the shipping profiles 1 and 2. Shipping group B contains the shipping profiles 3 and 4. If you want to assign an item to shipping profiles 3 and 4, open the item and select shipping group B from the drop-down list in the item's *Global* tab in the *Shipping profiles* section. +
With this function, you can easily assign the shipping profile to new items.

|*Shipping identification*
|This field is currently without any function.

2+|eBay

|*Account*
|Select one or more eBay accounts or select the option *ALL*. +
*_Important:_* You need to have set up at least 2 accounts, otherwise this option is not visible. Further information can be found in the chapter <<fulfilment/preparing-the-shipment#1200, Tips and tricks: Shipping costs for orders placed on eBay>>.

|*Listing type*
|Decide which eBay listing type you want to activate this shipping profile for.

2+|Further options

|*Express delivery*
|Activate if you want to use this shipping profile for express delivery. +
*_Important:_* Make sure that the shipping service provider offers express delivery. This is required to use the option.

|*Loyalty program*
|Select one or more loyalty programs. You can use the loyalty programs with <<markets/ebay/ebay-setup#6600, eBay Plus>> or <<markets/amazon/amazon-setup#4200, Amazon>>. +
*_Important:_* If you select a loyalty program for a shipping profile, you can only use the shipping profile for the market. It is not possible to use the shipping profile for the online store. If, for example, the *eBay Plus* option is activated in a shipping profile, the shipping profile is only used for *eBay Plus* orders. Therefore, create an extra shipping profile that you only use for the loyalty program.
|====

[TIP]
.Default shipping profile cannot be deleted
====
When you defined a default shipping profile in the *Setup » Client* » _Select client_ » *Orders* menu, the button to delete this shipping profile from the shipping profile overview in the *Setup » Orders » Shipping » Settings » Tab: Shipping profiles* menu is disabled. Thus, it is not possible to delete the shipping profile that is saved as default shipping profile.

[#1100]
=== Tips and tricks: Extra shipping charges

The following partial amounts are added together if an order includes items with extra shipping charges:

* The shipping costs that were entered into the shipping profile (basic shipping charge)
* The extra shipping charge 1 for the item with the highest extra shipping charge
* The extra shipping charge 2 for each additional item

[.subhead]
Example: Adding extra shipping charges for different items

In this example, a customer orders 2 PCs and 2 monitors. The following shipping costs are saved for the items:

*Item 1: PC*

* Basic shipping charge (shipping profile) = EUR 3.99
* Extra shipping charge 1 = EUR 5.00
* Extra shipping charge 2 = EUR 3.00

*Item 2: Monitor*

* Basic shipping charge (shipping profile) = EUR 3.99
* Extra shipping charge 1 = EUR 4.00
* Extra shipping charge 2 = EUR 2.00

The customer orders 2 PCs and 2 monitors. The following shipping costs are calculated for the order:

* EUR 3.99 (basic shipping charge) + EUR 5.00 (PC: Extra shipping charge 1) + EUR 3.00 (PC: Extra shipping charge 2) + EUR 2.00 (Monitor: Extra shipping charge 2) + EUR 2.00 (Monitor: Extra shipping charge 2) = EUR 15.99

[.subhead]
Example: Extra shipping charges for multiple copies of the same item

In this example, a customer orders 1 PC, then 2 PCs and then 3 PCs. The following shipping costs are saved for the item:

*Item 1: PC*

* Basic shipping charge (shipping profile) = EUR 3.99
* Extra shipping charge 1 = EUR 5.00
* Extra shipping charge 2 = EUR 3.00

The customer orders 1 PC, then 2 PCs and then 3 PCs. The following shipping costs are calculated for the order:

* For 1 PC: EUR 3.99 (basic shipping charge) + EUR 5.00 (Extra shipping charge 1) = EUR 8.99
* For 2 PCs: EUR 3.99 (basic shipping charge) + EUR 5.00 (Extra shipping charge 1) + EUR 3.00 (Extra shipping charge 2) = EUR 11.99
* For 3 PCs: EUR 3.99 (basic shipping charge) + EUR 5.00 (Extra shipping charge 1) + EUR 3.00 (Extra shipping charge 2) + EUR 3.00 (Extra shipping charge 2) = EUR 14.99

[TIP]
.Calculating shipping costs with extra charges only
====
You can use the *Extra shipping charge* function to let the system calculate your shipping costs exclusively on the basis of ordered items. This is done by entering the shipping costs for each item into the item data record and setting all of the shipping prices to *zero* in the shipping profile.
====

[#1200]
=== Tips and tricks: Shipping costs for orders placed on eBay

Set up the shipping costs for orders placed on eBay in the *Setup » Listings » Checkout* menu. To do so, select *Transfer from eBay* or *Have it calculated by plentymarkets* under the option *Shipping costs for new orders coming from eBay*.

If shipping costs should be calculated differently for eBay than they are for orders coming from the online store, a separate shipping profile has to be created for them. In this shipping profile, select *eBay* only under the option *Order referrer*. This shipping profile has to be activated for every item that you want the setting to apply to. Thus, at least 2 shipping profiles are activated for these items: One is the shipping profile that contains the "normal" shipping costs and the other one is the shipping profile that contains the shipping costs for eBay.

[IMPORTANT]
.Own shipping profile per eBay account
====
If you activated several eBay accounts in your plentymarkets system, you can define an individual shipping profile for each eBay account. Go to *Setup » Orders » Shipping » Settings* and use the option *eBay account* in the *Shipping profiles* tab and there in the *Base* tab to select one of the different accounts.
====

[#1300]
=== Tips and tricks: Category

The category option is another way to prioritise shipping profiles. You can use this option to decide which shipping profiles should be displayed in the shopping cart. Category *1* is selected by default. This means that all of the shipping profiles are given the same priority.

The following rules apply:

* The shipping profile with the lowest category is always displayed.
* For multiple items, the common shipping profile with the lowest category is displayed.
* If the items do not have a common shipping profile, the shipping profile with the lowest category is selected.

[TIP]
."Creating a "replacement shipping profile"
====
Create a shipping profile that has a higher category level than the other shipping profiles. This so called "replacement shipping profile" is only chosen if none of the others apply or if they cannot be chosen.
====

[.subhead]
Example: Selling 18+ items together with other items

You can use categories to sell items that have the shipping profile *delivery to addressee only* (e.g. items released for age 18 and older) together with other items. This is solved as follows:

*Item A*

* Shipping profile 1 (category 1)
* Shipping profile 2 (category 2)

*Item B* (18+ item)

* Shipping profile 2 (category 2)
* Shipping profile 3 (category 5)

If item A is bought alone, shipping profile 2 is not displayed because a shipping profile is available that has a lower category. If both items are bought together, shipping profile 2 has the lowest common category and is therefore the only profile that is displayed.

[#1400]
=== Tips and tricks: Shipping profile combinations that can cause errors

Make sure that all items that can be bought together have at least one common shipping profile. If there are 2 or more items in the shopping cart which do not have a common shipping profile, the shipping profile calculation takes place and the shipping charges are added together for the profiles. However, only the shipping service provider with the higher priority is displayed in the shopping cart. Shipping profiles should not be combined in this way. Such combinations cause errors to occur.

You can avoid such errors, e.g. by activating a DHL shipping profile for all items and only activating an additional shipping profile for selected items.

[.subhead]
Example: No common shipping profile

There are 2 items in the shopping cart which do not have a common shipping profile.

*Item A*

* DPD shipping profile
* Flat rate shipping charge of EUR 3.95

*Item B*

* DHL shipping profile
* Flat rate shipping charge of EUR 2.95

The priority determines the order in which shipping profiles are displayed in the checkout process in your online store. The customer sees a total shipping charge of 6.90 EUR. However, the customer only sees the shipping service provider with the higher priority in the shopping cart.

[WARNING]
.Error message in the checkout if shipping profile combinations are incompletely calculated

If multiple items are to be sent that do not have a common shipping profile, the system calculates the shipping profile combination.

If for at least one of the items no shipping profile can be assigned due to filters and limitations set (e.g. blocked payment methods), the shipping profile combination is incomplete and will be rejected.

In this case, your customers will see the error code 53 (error in the shipping cost calculation) during the checkout and no shipping profile will be selected automatically.

*_Important:_* If you set up shipping profiles with several filters and limitations, such as blocked payment methods, check these shipping profiles and adapt them, if necessary.

The error message as well as the translation of error code 53 can be adjusted for the Ceres plugin. To do so, go to *CMS » Multilingualism*, expand the section *Notifications* and enter the translation in the line *notificationsCalculatedShippingFailed*.

Adapt the error code also in the *Setup » Client » Global » Language packages* menu in the *Error messages* section , if necessary.

== Selecting a calculation type in the table of shipping charges

Calculation types in the *Table of shipping charges* tab are different ways to calculate shipping costs for items. For example, you can calculate shipping costs based on an item's weight or volume or based on the number of items that are purchased. You can select a different calculation type for each region. All of the different calculation types are explained in the section below. <<#table-settings-calculation-type>> contains notes that apply to the calculation types in general.

[[table-settings-calculation-type]]
.General settings of the calculation types
[cols="1,3"]
|====
|Setting |Explanation

|*Maximum values*
|If the maximum saved value (volume, weight, price, quantity) is exceeded, no shipping costs can be calculated. Therefore, the maximum should always be high enough.

|*Flat rates*
|A flat-rate shipping charge can be defined starting from a particular value of items. If the order reaches or exceeds this value of items, the flat-rate shipping charge is used for the calculation. These flat rates take priority over the values saved for weights, volumes or quantities.

|*Limitations*
|Limitations allow you to specify minimum and maximum values for each shipping profile. If an order does not meet or exceeds these values, it is not possible to use the shipping profile for this order. You can create another shipping profile as an alternative, e.g. a profile for a different shipping service provider. It should have values that go beyond the limitations.
|====

[#1610.subhead]
Calculation type: Flat rate

This calculation type treats shipping costs as total prices. In other words, regardless how many items a customer purchases, they only pay the shipping costs entered here.

In this case, it would be wise to set up an extra shipping charge for each additional item. You can do so by saving <<item/managing-items#290, extra shipping charges>> within the items' *Shipping* section and by activating the *Item extra shipping charge* option in the *Base* tab of the shipping profile.

[#1620.subhead]
Calculation type: Weight-dependent

If you select the calculation type *Weight-dependent*, enter the maximum gross weight in grams into the column *Maximum (g)*. Enter the corresponding shipping costs into the column *Amount (EUR)*. This way, you create a sliding scale of shipping costs according to weight. Click on *Add* to add further graduated prices.

[#1630.subhead]
Calculation type: Volume-dependent

If you select the calculation type *Volume-dependent*, enter the maximum volume in cubic metres into the column *Maximum (cubic metres)*. Enter the corresponding shipping costs into the column *Amount (EUR)*. This way, you create a sliding scale of shipping costs according to the item's volume. Click on *Add* to add further graduated prices.

[WARNING]
.Dimensions have to be saved for the item
====
The volume is only calculated correctly if you saved the item's length, width and height within the main variation's *Settings* tab in the <<item/managing-items#270, Dimensions>> section in the _Item » Edit item_ » *Open item* menu. It is not possible to calculate the volume if these entries are missing. Therefore, it is not possible to calculate the shipping costs based on the volume either.
====

[#1640.subhead]
Calculation type: Quantity-dependent

If you select the calculation type *Quantity-dependent*, enter the maximum number of items into the column *Maximum (no.)*. Enter the corresponding shipping costs into the column *Amount (EUR)*. This way, you create a sliding scale of shipping costs according to the number of items. Click on *Add* to add further graduated prices.

[#1650.subhead]
Calculation type: Price-dependent

If you select the calculation type *Price-dependent*, enter the maximum order total into the column *Maximum (EUR)* and the corresponding shipping costs into the column *Amount (EUR)*. This way, you create a sliding scale of shipping costs according to the value of a particular item. If all of the items use the same shipping profile, you have a sliding scale for the total price of an entire order.

[#1660.subhead]
Calculation type: Item shipping charge

If you select the calculation type *Item shipping charge*, the shipping costs depend on the number of items. Depending on which amount you enter in the field *Each additional item*, the shipping costs for each additional item increase by this amount.

[#1700]
== Calculating the shipping costs

In the *Calculate shipping costs* tab, you can configure the shipping costs that are needed for exporting items to price comparison portals. The general shipping profiles are not used for price comparison portals. Configure settings that are appropriate for all of the items that are exported to price comparison portals. If these settings are not configured, the shipping costs are exported incorrectly or they are exported with the entry "0".

For further information, refer to the <<data/exporting-data/FormatDesigner/format-types/orders#, FormatDesigner>> page of the manual.

Select the most general default referrer possible, e.g. *Client (store)*. Select a standard shipping region that includes all of the countries of delivery for the items that you want to export.

[TIP]
.Cash in advance payment method
====
Be sure to select the payment method *Cash in advance* so that this payment method can be used as an alternative in case the other payment methods are rejected.
====

[.instruction]
Calculating the shipping costs:

. Go to *Setup » Orders » Shipping » Settings*.
. Click on the *Calculate shipping costs* tab.
. Select the *default referrer*, *default shipping region*, *payment method 1* and *payment method 2* for both configurations.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

[#1800]
== Activating the shipping profile

You are not able to ship an item with a specific shipping profile until you open the item data record and activate the profile. Activate at least one shipping profile per item. Otherwise, the shipping costs may not be calculated correctly.

[.instruction]
Activating the shipping profile:

. Open the *Item » Edit item* menu.
. Open the item which you want to activate the shipping profile for.
. Click on the *Global* tab.
. Activate the shipping profile.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

[IMPORTANT]
.Default shipping profile
====
If an order contains items for which no shipping profile was activated, the items are given the default shipping profile of the default online store. The standard shipping profile can be selected in the <<online-store/online-store/order-process#, Setup » Client » Select client » Orders>> menu. If no default shipping profile was specified, the shipping profile with the highest priority is used.
====

[#1900]
== Creating a shipping package

In the *Setup » Orders » Shipping » Shipping packages* menu, you create shipping packages for your shipping processes. You can set up shipping packages with clearly defined dimensions or you can let your plentymarkets system automatically define the size based on the item data. A standard package is automatically assigned if you do not create a shipping package and assign it to an order. The volume of the standard package is calculated based on the item data.

[TIP]
.Examples: Defined shipping packages and individual packaging
====
Defined shipping packages: A seller ships their items in 2 different cardboard box sizes. Therefore, they need to set up 2 shipping packages. The volume of these packages results from the dimensions entered and saved. +
Shipping package 1: 30 cm x 25 cm x 40 cm +
Shipping package 2: 50 cm x 50 cm x 25 cm

Individual packaging: In order to ship e.g. furniture, the seller uses packaging material that is individually cut to match the size of the item to be shipped. These materials can be corrugated card board, foil etc. The volume is calculated based on the item data.
====

Proceed as described below to create a shipping package.

[.instruction]
Creating a shipping package:

. Go to *Setup » Orders » Shipping » Shipping packages*.
. Click on the *New Shipping package* tab.
. Carry out the settings. Pay attention to the information given in <<#table-create-shipping-package>>.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

[[table-create-shipping-package]]
.Creating a shipping package
[cols="1,3"]
|====
|Setting |Explanation

|*Name*
|Enter the name.

|*Volume*
|Select *take from the shipping package* (length, width, height) or *take from the item data (total)*. +
If you select the option take from the item data (total), the lines *Length*, *Width* and *Height* are no longer visible.

|*Length*, *Width*, *Height*
|Enter the values for the dimensions of the shipping package and pay attention to the unit.

|*Unit*
|Select the unit from the drop-down list.

|*Maximum weight (KG)*
|Enter the maximum weight in kilograms. +
*_Note:_* If this weight is exceeded, the shipping package with the lowest ID is used. The settings in this shipping package have no further impact because it is the standard package in your system. +
*_Example:_* 2 shipping packages are set up in your system: Shipping package A with the lowest ID and no further settings as well as shipping package B with a maximum permissible weight of 10 kg. If an order with a weight of 12 kg is now coming into the system, shipping package B does not apply any longer and shipping package A is used.

|*Maximum volume (total)*
|Enter the maximum volume in cubic metres. +
*_Note:_* This value refers to the total volume of the shipping package and is the sum of the volumes of the items contained in it. This number gives you an idea of whether or not the items of an order fit into the shipping package.

|*Client (store)*
|Select the client (store) from the drop-down list. Select the option *ALL* if you wish to make the shipping package available for all online stores.
|====

How you edit, add or delete shipping packages is described on the <<fulfilment/shipping-centre#, Using the shipping centre>> page of the manual.

[#2300]
== Controlling shipping processes

<<automation/processes/setting-up-processes#, Processes>> are a tool that you can use to manage all of your shipping processes. It is possible to set up and customise very specific processes and carry out these processes automatically. For example, you can use the procedures <<automation/processes/procedures#340, Polling>>, <<automation/processes/procedures#380, Return label>>, <<automation/processes/procedures#390, Return slip>> and <<automation/processes/procedures#430, Shipping centre>> to process your shipments.

[#2400]
== Viewing the API log

The *Shipping centre API log* tab in the *Data » API log* menu contains information about shipments that were registered in the *Orders » Shipping centre* menu. Select the shipping service provider from the drop-down list *Process* as well as a date and the processes displayed per page. Click on *Search* to display the processes.

|Setting |Explanation

2+|Master data

|*Billing numbers*
|Enter the billing numbers in accordance with the DHL contract. It is possible to maintain individual shipper data for each billing number. The 14-digit DHL Intraship/Versenden billing number is composed of the following: +
*EKP* = PP = customer number; consists of the first 10 numbers of the billing number. +
*Process* = Indicates the DHL product that the billing number is valid for. It is made up of the two middle characters of the billing number. +
*_Important:_* Pay attention to the explanations given in the box below the table. +
*Subscription* = The last two characters of the billing number (only numbers or letters are permitted).

|*Login name*
|The login name may not contain any umlauts. Even if a login name with umlauts is accepted by the website, the interface may still reject it.

|*Password*
|The maximum password length is 20 characters. Although DHL technically allows you to use a longer password, you may only use a maximum of 20 characters via the plentymarkets interface. If you use a password that is longer than 20 characters, errors occur when transferring data with the SOAP interface.

|*Alternative telephone number for foreign customers*
|DHL typically prints the recipient's telephone number on the label when shipping to foreign countries. This allows DHL to contact the recipient if needed. If you do not want this to be the case, save a corresponding entry such as "No Tel." or enter a string of zeros. This entry overrides the foreign customer's telephone number. +
The option is also important if you did not mark the telephone number for foreign customers as a mandatory field in the layout. Otherwise DHL would reject the shipment.

|*Force label generation*
|When registering a shipment with DHL Intraship/Versenden in the shipping centre, decide whether a shipping label should be generated even if there was no data / incomplete data saved for the address. +
*Yes* = DHL corrects the incorrect data and bill you for this service (default setting). +

*_Important:_* DHL Intraship/Versenden uses the number 01 for the product Regionalpaket AT. However, we use the number 02 because there can be conflicts in plentymarkets with DHL Paket. DHL Domestic Express uses the number 71 so that there are no conflicts with DHL Officepack. Of course, the correct number is sent to DHL.

DHL export documents

DHL export documents are only generated for orders that are shipped with the product *DHL Paket International* and that are actually export shipments. Export shipments have to contain a customs declaration, the so-called CN23 document, and a dispatch note, the so-called CP71 document. *DHL Paket International* can also be used for intra-community deliveries. However, no export documents are generated in this case.

Export shipments may contain a maximum of 5 stock units. The following data for each stock unit is reported: Weight, customs tariff number, manufacturer country, item name, value of items and quantity.

If you are using the DHL Intraship/Versenden interface, you can manually generate the export documents via the *Orders » Fulfilment* menu. In order for orders to be found for the creation of export documents, they have to be successfully registered with DHL Intraship/Versenden via the *Orders » Shipping centre* menu.

[#4800]
=== DHL Fulfillment

Set up link:https://www.dhl.de/en/geschaeftskunden/paket/leistungen-und-services/fulfillment.html[DHL Fulfilment^] in your plentymarkets system. To do so, proceed as described below.

[IMPORTANT]
.Klarna orders are not transferred to DHL Fulfillment
====
Currently, it is not possible to transfer orders that are paid with <<payment/klarna#, Klarna>> to DHL Fulfillment. Only orders with a valid invoice can be transferred to DHL Fulfillment. However, Klarna only transmits the invoice to plentymarkets after outgoing items are booked.
====

Registering the shipment with DHL Fulfillment takes place automatically via the interface. The *Data » API log* menu contains information about shipments that were registered with DHL Fulfillment. For further information about API log entries for DHL Fulfillment, refer to the <<data/api-log#, API log>> page of the manual.

[#4850]
==== Requirements for the item transfer to DHL Fulfillment

The following requirements must be met to ensure that the variation is correctly transferred to DHL Fulfillment:

* The variation is active.
* A valid sales warehouse of the type *DHL Fulfillment* is selected as main warehouse of the variation.
* The variation has not been previously transferred to DHL Fulfillment.
* The variation has a sales price that is activated for the currency *Euro* and the referrer *WEB API*. The price at the variation can also be EUR 0.00. However, a sales price has to be active.

[#4870]
==== Creating a shipping service provider and a shipping profile for DHL Fulfillment

In order that the services are correctly processed, it is important that you create the shipping service provider *DHL Fulfillment*. To do so, go to *Setup » Orders » Shipping » Settings* and click on the *Shipping service provider* tab. Further information can be found in the chapter <<fulfilment/preparing-the-shipment#800, Creating a shipping service provider>>.

Afterwards, you create a shipping profile for DHL Fulfillment. Carry out the settings as described in the <<fulfilment/preparing-the-shipment#1000, Creating a shipping profile>> chapter.

Go to *Setup » Orders » Shipping » Options* and click on the *Shipping profiles* tab. In the *Table of shipping charges* tab of DHL Fulfillment shipping profile in the *DHL Fulfillment* section, you can select the options Germany, United Kingdom or France from the drop-down list *DHL Fulfillment region*.

[#4900]
==== Creating a warehouse

First, go to *Setup » Stock » Warehouse* and create warehouses for the items processed by DHL Fulfillment. Select the *logistics type* DHL Fulfillment for all warehouses. Select these warehouses as the main warehouses for items that are processed by DHL Fulfillment. To do so, go to *Item » Edit item*, open the item and select the main warehouse in the *Shipping* area. For further information about creating warehouses, refer to the <<stock-management/setting-up-a-warehouse#, Setting up a warehouse>> page of the manual.

Create the following warehouse types to set up DHL Fulfillment:

* *Sales*
* *Storage*
* *Repair*
* *Other*

[TIP]
.Selection of multiple sales warehouses possible
====
Currently, it is possible to select the following DHL Fulfillment subsidiaries:

* Staufenberg
* Langenfeld
* Braunschweig
* Kirchheim
* Oud-Gastel
* Radlett
* Nieuwegein
* Derendingen
* Wissous
* Rosersberg

Make sure to use correct spelling of the subsidiaries in the *Town* field of the warehouse settings. This will ensure that the orders are transferred to the correct subsidiary.

If you do not work with multiple DHL Fulfillment subsidiaries, it is not necessary to enter one of these towns.
====

In order for the DHL Fulfillment interface to work correctly, you need at least one warehouse of the type *Sales* with *DHL Fulfillment* as the logistics type. You can create up to 4 warehouses. DHL assigns the warehouses according to the stock types that they use. For example, DHL assigns stock of the stock type *Prime Selection* to the sales warehouse. These items are meant to be sold directly. Items with the stock type *Second Quality* are not meant to be sold and need a separate warehouse, e.g. the *Storage* warehouse. If these items were checked and are able to be sold, they are assigned to the stock type *Prime Selection* and moved to the Sales warehouse.

[WARNING]
.Warehouse assignment by DHL
====
DHL assigns stock to the warehouses that you created for DHL Fulfillment. Do not change any of the stocks that are intended for DHL Fulfillment.
====

DHL Fulfillment uses the following stock types:

* *Prime Selection*: First choice, intended for sale, assigned to sales warehouse
* *Second Quality*: Second choice, not intended for sale, assigned to storage warehouse
* *Damaged*: Damaged items, not intended for sale, assigned to repair warehouse
* *Blocked* and *Clearing*: Blocked items and items that need to be checked, not for sale, assigned to an extra warehouse (warehouse type: Other)

Damaged items can be returns but also items that were damaged while being moved within the warehouse or that were already damaged when they were delivered.

If you create reorders for your items in the *Stock » Reorder management » Reorders* menu, make sure that the reorder is in *Status [2] Confirmed*. Only if the reorder is in this status can it be transmitted to DHL Fulfillment. For further information about reorders, refer to the <<stock-management/managing-reorders#, Managing reorders>> page of the manual.

Note that your plentymarkets system is only able to adapt changes to stock if the item data has been transmitted to DHL Fulfillment via plentymarkets. It is important that DHL Fulfillment has confirmed the items in order that these items can be taken into account.

[#5000]
==== Creating order statuses

Go to *Setup » Orders » Order status* and set up 2 <<orders/managing-orders#1200, order statuses>> for the orders transferred to DHL Fulfillment. In the following, you find 2 examples:

* [6.5] Currently being shipped by fulfilment service provider +
→ For correctly registered orders

* [5.6] Error with fulfilment service provider +
→ For orders which could not be processed by DHL Fulfillment because of incorrect order details. Example: Item master data was not yet transferred to DHL Fulfillment.

[TIP]
.Orders in status 5.x
====
An order is automatically transferred to DHL Fulfillment if the order is in *status 5.x* and an invoice was created for the order. The transfer interval is about every 15 minutes. The only exception is the order status that is used for the option *Order status in case of error*. Orders are not transferred to DHL Fulfillment if they are in this status.

The *Data » API log* menu contains information about shipments that were registered with DHL Fulfillment. For further information about API log entries for DHL Fulfillment, refer to the <<data/api-log#, API log>> page of the manual.
====

If you want to create a specific workflow for processing DHL Fulfillment orders, you should also create another status, e.g. *5.4 Preparation for fulfilment service provider* to separate DHL Fulfillment orders from other orders even before they are transferred to DHL.

[#5100]
==== Creating reasons for returns

If you want returns from DHL Fulfillment to be imported into your plentymarkets system, you need to create reasons for the returns. Go to <<orders/managing-orders#410, Setup » Orders » Order types » Return>> to create reasons for returns. Afterwards, link the reasons that you created with the reasons given by DHL Fulfillment in the *Setup » Orders » Shipping » Fulfilment service provider » DHL Fulfillment* menu.

[#5200]
==== Setting up the interface

In the interface settings, you enter your login details, assign the order statuses and link the reasons for return.

[.instruction]

. Go to *Setup » Orders » Shipping » Fulfilment » DHL Fulfillment*.
. Carry out the settings. Pay attention to the information given in <<#table-interface-dhl-fulfillment>>.

|====

[#5300]
==== Transferring characteristics

Create characteristics in the *Setup » Item » Characteristics* menu and transfer item characteristics such as  "Fragile" or "Original packaging" to DHL Fulfillment if you want the items to be handled or shipped in a certain way. How to create a characteristic is described on the <<item/settings/properties#300, Characteristics and properties>> page of the manual. The following characteristics can be transferred to DHL Fulfillment:

* *Expiration date*: The item is stored in the DHL Fulfillment warehouse with a mandatory expiration date. When recording new incoming items, DHL Fulfillment also records an expiration date for items that have this property.
* *Original packaging*: The item is shipped individually by DHL Fulfillment in its original packaging.
* *Fragile*: DHL Fulfillment uses additional packaging materials while the item is boxed up.
* *Serial number*: The serial number is scanned while the item is boxed up. DHL Fulfillment transmits this serial number to plentymarkets along with the shipping confirmation so that the serial number can be printed on the invoice and can be used by customers (e.g. for documentation, coupons).

[IMPORTANT]
.Selecting the correct characteristics type for the properties
====
Go to *Setup » Item » Characteristics* and create the following 3 characteristics of the type *None*:

* *Expiration date*
* *Original packaging*
* *Fragile*

Create the characteristic *Serial number* with the characteristic type *Selection* and save the following 3 values:

* *SN* (Used for scanning an item's serial numbers)
* *SNK* (Used for scanning ranges of serial numbers per item)
* *SNK2* (Used for scanning ranges of serial numbers per order item)

For further information, refer to the <<item/managing-items#80, Activating characteristics>> chapter on the <<item/managing-items#, Manually creating items>> page of the manual.
====

After you created the characteristics, <<item/managing-items#80, activate>> these characteristics for the item within the item's *Characteristics* tab. Finally, go to *Setup » Orders » Shipping » Fulfilment » DHL Fulfillment* and use the drop-down lists to select the characteristics that you created.

Before transmitting the order to DHL Fulfillment, the recipient's address is checked with respect to a valid form and structure; i.e. plentymarkets checks for example if all mandatory fields such as the name are filled out. +
If the address contains faulty HTML signs and/or invalid signs that are not accepted by the API, these signs are corrected. If, however, the address contains an error that cannot be corrected, the order is not transmitted. This prevents a disturbance within the process because DHL Fulfillment cannot retrieve invalid and/or faulty XML files from the FTP server.

[#5310]
