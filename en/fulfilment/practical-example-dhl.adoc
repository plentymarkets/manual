This page describes how to set up the DHL Shipping (Versenden) plugin in plentymarkets. We will walk through the necessary steps in order that your customers can choose DHL as shipping method in your online store and that you can successfully register the order via DHL Shipping.

== Purchasing, installing and deploying the DHL Shipping plugin

This chapter describes how you purchase the DHL Shipping plugin in the plentyMarketplace and how you install and deploy it in the plentymarkets back end afterwards.

=== Purchasing

First, you have to establish a basis in order to successfully work with DHL in the future. It is required that you download the link:https://marketplace.plentymarkets.com/en/plugins/integration/DHLShipping_4871[DHL Shipping plugin^] from our plentyMarketplace.

The plugin is free of charge and can be purchased by clicking on *Go to checkout*. Please follow further instructions in the plentyMarketplace.

=== Installing

After you have purchased the plugin, you have to install it in your plentymarkets system. After the purchase, you will find the plugin in the menu *Plugins » Plugin overview*. For the display of newly purchased plugins, activate the filter "Not installed" and confirm the search. There you have to install the plugin by clicking the button *Install plugin*.

=== Activating and deploying

As soon as the plugin is installed, you have to deploy it in your plugin set in order to set it up later on. To do so, the following steps are necessary:

You will find the plugin in the list in the menu *Plugin » Plugin overview*.

Click on the globe in the plugin (*Not active*) to activate the plugin. If you made changes to the plugin, you have to deploy all plugin sets for the system. This is simply done by clicking on *Save & deploy plugin set*. This process may take a little while:

[NOTE]
.Plugin set
====
Pay attention that the DHL Shipping plugin must be activated for the *plugin set* with the *standard client* in order that the menu items are displayed after the deploy process and that you can carry out further settings.
====

How you set up the plugin is described in detail in another chapter.

But before you configure the DHL Shipping plugin, you have to carry out some settings in the plentymarkets back end.

== Activating countries of delivery

Since the plugin is basically ready, you can now proceed with the next steps. In this part, it is important that you thoroughly think about in which countries you want to deliver your items to. After you have determined these countries, you can activate them in the **Setup » Orders » Shipping » Settings » Tab: Countries of delivery** menu. The countries are then available for the next step. Please note that in plentymarkets it is necessary to create own "countries of delivery" for the special regions, such as Helgoland or the Canary Islands.

The following options can be selected for the countries of delivery:

.Options for the countries of delivery
[cols="1,3"]
|====
|Option |Description

|Inactive
|The country of delivery is not active.

|Active
|The country of delivery is unrestrictedly active.

|Backoffice is active
|Countries of delivery with this setting are only visible in the plentymarkets system and not in the online store.

|Supplier is active
|Countries of delivery with this setting cannot be selected as the standard country of delivery in the menu *Setup » Client » Select client » Order process » Settings*.
|====

.Activating countries of delivery
image::fulfilment/assets/DHL_plugin_activate_countries_of_delivery.png[width=640, height=360]

== Creating regions

You have to group the activated countries of delivery now. You will find the shipping regions in the menu *Setup » Orders » Shipping » Settings » Tab: Regions*. Group the countries for which the same shipping conditions should apply to one common region.

[TIP]
.Example for different shipping costs
====
If you want to charge EUR 14.90 as shipping costs for both Spain and France, put those two countries into region. If you want to charge EUR 20.90 as shipping costs for Italy, however, it is not possible to put Italy together with Spain and France in one region. You have to create an own region for Italy.
====

On the left side of the region, you can see all available countries of delivery. On the right side, you can see all countries of delivery that are already linked with this region. Now add all active countries of delivery to a region. Please note that each country of delivery can only be saved in one region.

.Setting up regions
image::fulfilment/assets/DHL_plugin_set_up_regions.png[width=640, height=360]

== Creating a shipping service provider

Besides the countries of delivery and the corresponding regions, you also need the correct shipping service provider in order to build a bridge between the plugin and the shipping profiles. Configure the shipping service provider in the *Setup » Orders » Shipping » Settings » Tab: Shipping service provider* menu.

Here, you choose a name for the shipping service provider and select the service provider *DHL Shipping (Versenden)* from the drop-down list.

.Creating a shipping service provider

[NOTE]
.Tracking URL
====
Furthermore, you can also add in this menu the Tracking URL "*http://nolp.dhl.de/nextt-online-public/set_identcodes.do?lang=de&zip=$PLZ&idc=$PaketNr*". The tracking URL is required for sending emails at a later point in time.
====

== Creating a shipping profile

All menu items that you have set up so far, will "meet" in the shipping profile. To do so, go to *Setup » Orders » Shipping » Settings » Tab: Shipping profiles*. By clicking on the *New* button (plus symbol), you create a new shipping profile and directly access the *Base* tab. The *Table of shipping charges* tab is only available after you have saved.

=== Base

In the **Base** tab, you determine the basic settings for your shipping profile.

.Field name description in the shipping profile
[cols="1,3"]
|====
|Field name |Description

|Shipping service provider
|Select the shipping service provider that you have just created.

|Name & Name (back end)
|Select a name for the front and back end in the corresponding language.

|Flag
|Here, you can assign a flag to the profile (e.g. the DHL logo).

|Priority
|The priority determines in which order the shipping profiles are displayed in the online store.

|Category
|The category option is another way to prioritise shipping profiles. An example of use can be found link:https://knowledge.plentymarkets.com/en/fulfilment/preparing-the-shipment#1300[here].

|Item extra shipping charge
|You can activate extra shipping charges that are saved for the item.

|Postident
|Activate this option, if PostIdent is required. For example, in case of goods that can only be purchased from age 18.

|Activate for new items
|Activate this option in order that the profile is always activate for new items.

|Cash on delivery
|Activate the option in order that your customer can select the payment method Cash on delivery in your online store.

|Extra charge for islands
|The set extra shipping charge will be calculated by means of a defined list in plentymarkets when delivery is made to certain islands.

|Clients (stores)
|Select the clients that should be linked with this shipping profile. Select at least one client in order that the shipping profile can be selected.

|Order referrer
|Here, you select the order referrers for which this shipping profile should be activated.

|Blocked payment methods
|Here, you select the payment methods for which the shipping profile should *not* be available.

|Blocked customer classes
|Here, you select the customer classes for which the shipping profile should *not* be available.

|Shipping groups

|*eBay*
|

|Express delivery
|Activate if you want to use this shipping profile for eBay express delivery.

|Loyalty program
|Here, you can link one or multiple loyalty programs such as eBay Plus or Amazon Prime to this shipping profile.

|====

=== Table of shipping charges

The tab *table of shipping charges* is only available after you have saved the shipping profile. In this tab, the tables of shipping charges for the created regions are displayed. This means that you determine the prices and the calculation types for the individual regions.
Select the calculation basis for the shipping costs. The following options are available: *Flat rate*, *Weight-dependent*, *Volume-dependent*, *Quantity-dependent*, *Price-dependent* and *Item shipping charge*.

Depending on the type settings, you have to enter the correct prices. Furthermore, you can save for each table of shipping charges the amount from which shipping is free of charge, for example. Or you choose that shipping only costs EUR 2.50 instead of EUR 4.99 when the value of items ordered is EUR 100 at least.

The limitation type limits the shipping profile. Pay attention that you allow for a seamless transition with your shipping profiles. For example: You have set the maximum weight of 20 kg in one shipping profile. Your customer puts two items with a weight of 11 kg each in the shopping cart. Therefore, another shipping profile should be selectable. In this way, an error message in the online store will be avoided.

You can save a pre-defined shipping package as standard package. A shipping package can be defined in the menu *Setup » Orders » Shipping » Shipping packages*. In this way, you can transfer fixed dimensions when you only use one package size for the shipment.

[NOTE]
.Calculation types
====
Please pay attention that it might be necessary to save the weight for the weight-dependent calculation at the individual items. Otherwise, calculation will not be possible.
====

.Calculation types in the table of shipping charges
image::fulfilment/assets/DHL_plugin_calculation_types_table_of_shipping_charges.png[width=640, height=360]

[NOTE]
.Activating the table of shipping charges
====
The table of shipping charges is only active after you have saved it. Otherwise, you will see the note *Region not used in shipping profile. Save price to use region. Save and reload table of shipping charges to show shipping service provider settings.*
====

== Activating the shipping profile for an item

In the *Items » Edit item » Tab: Global* menu, you have to link all items with the desired shipping profiles. This can also be done via the group function. Make sure that the checkmark is placed for the option *Delete old shipping profiles* since it is only possible to add further shipping profiles via the "shipping configuration".

== Configuring the DHL Shipping plugin

After you set up the shipping profiles and linked them to the items, you can start to finally set up the DHL Shipping plugin:

=== Set up

Afterwards, you switch to the *Setup » Orders » Shipping » DHLShipping* menu where you will find the following sub-menus.

*Basic settings*

In the basic settings, you enter the access data that you have saved for the DHL user. Furthermore, you also have the possibility to save an alternative telephone number and email address. If one of these fields is filled, only this data will be transferred to DHL and not the customer's data anymore. The setting in the shipping profile regarding *Transfer email and telephone* will not be taken into consideration in the plugin. Last, you can find the checkbox for the non-codable addresses here. If the checkmark is placed, DHL will also accept non-codable shipping orders. However, this may lead to additional costs at DHL. Please contact your DHL contact person for further information.

[NOTE]
.Validity of DHL user
====
Please note that there are two types of users at DHL. These users have a password validity of 3 or 12 months. If the password has expired, you have to save a new password at DHL and save it also in the basic settings of the plugin.
====

*Accounting numbers*

You receive from DHL an individual billing number for each of your booked services (e.g. DHL Paket National). This number has 14 characters and is divided in 10, 2 and 2. The first 10 characters are the EKP and are identical for each service. The following 2 characters stand for the service (e.g. 01 for DHL Paket National). The last 2 characters must be entered in the field Subscription.

*Return data*

In the area of the shipper data, you enter the data which should be printed as shipper address on the DHL label.

*Shipping settings*

At last, we carry out the most important step: setting the shipping settings. In the shipping settings, all settings are combined. Here, you select which shipping profile is to "work" with which shipping region and which billing number in the future. It is important that you save an individual setting for each profile and each region in this profile. Depending on which services you have booked at DHL, you can save them in this configuration. An example of this would be the service "cash on delivery".
The field *Minimum package weight for transmission to DHL (in grams)* can be used to increase the weight of the items for the registration. It is necessary, however, that a weight is saved for the items. The last point in the shipping settings relates to foreign deliveries. For deliveries to foreign countries, the postage for export shipping as well as the type of shipment are mandatory fields.

Once you have carried out these settings step by step, you can successfully register your orders with the DHL Shipping plugin via a process and the procedure *Shipping centre* or via the menu *Orders » Shipping centre*. If nevertheless an error should occur, you will find in the lower part of this page some possible error sources and possible solutions. Errors may be caused due to incorrect address data at the order, for example.

=== Deploying the plugin set once again after update

After you have downloaded an update of the plugin, it is necessary that you deploy the plugin set once again. Downloading the update does not lead to the fact that new features or changes are also active in the new version.
