→ All shipping profiles available for plentymarkets are displayed.
. Select the shipping profile from the list.

[#295]
=== Assigning user rights for back end users

Users of the type *Back end* can only access limited areas and menus in the plentymarkets back end. Thus, their access to the system is limited. If users of this type should be able to access the plugin, a user of the type *Admin* has to assign at least the rights listed in <<table-ebay-fulfillment-user-rights>> to those users.

[.instruction]
Assigning user rights for back end users:

. Open the *Setup » Settings » User » Rights » User* menu in your plentymarkets back end.
. Use the search function (icon:search[role="blue"]) and open the user account that should be edited.
. In the *Authorisations* and *Plugins* sections, activate the rights as listed in <<table-ebay-fulfillment-user-rights>>.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

=== Setting up items and obtaining the EBFSKU

Set up the items that you would like to send via eBay Fulfillment. By activating the item, the EBFSKU is automatically transmitted to plentymarkets.

[IMPORTANT]
.Hourly check of the EBFSKU
====
The EBFSKU is checked automatically once an hour. Thus, after setting up the items, it can take up to one hour for the EBFSKU to become visible in the item data.
====

[.instruction]
Setting up items:

. In the plentymarkets back end, go to *Item » Edit items*.
. Open the variation that you would like to send via eBay Fulfillment. +
→ The main variation opens.
. In the section *Sales prices*, enter the desired sales price.
. Click on the *Availability* tab.
. In the section *Markets*, activate the options *eBay*, *eBay Fulfillment* and *WEB API*.
. Click on the plus sign to activate the markets.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.
. Go back to the *Settings* tab.
. In the *Availability* section, place a checkmark next to *Active*.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the setting. +
→ The item is activated and the EBSFKU is automatically transmitted to plentymarkets.

[WARNING]
.Availability and eBay sales price must be saved
====
Item master data is only transmitted from plentymarkets to eBay Fulfillment when the availability and the eBay sales price are set.
====

[#320]
=== Setting up item packages (bundles)

A bundle, a so-called item package, consists of several items. The bundle price may be lower than the sum of the individual prices.

If you have already set up item packages in your plentymarkets system, there are still 2 setting options for the items that you must make so that they can be processed by eBay Fulfillment.

[#330]
==== Bundle of several items as a unit
The bundle consists of several items that form a unit. This means that the bundle is offered as such a unit and is sent to eBay Fulfillment in a single package. An EBFSKU is assigned to the complete package.

*Example of a bundle of several Items as a unit:*

A somewhat abstract example of a "fixed" bundle is a car. The car is sold as a unit and it is not planned, for example, to just remove the steering wheel and then sell it, although the steering wheel can still be a single items.

[#340]
==== Bundle of several individual items

The bundle consists of several individual items. This means that you have to set the availability in each component of this package as described in chapter <<fulfilment/ebay-fulfillment#310, Setting up items and obtaining the EBSFKU>>. This means that each item in the package has its own EBFSKU. When submitting an order to eBay Fulfillment, each component of the item package is treated like an individual item order.

*Example of a bundle of several individual items:*

You sell dining room chairs and dining room tables. You also offer a combination of the items as a bundle (1 dining room table and 4 dining room chairs). In contrast to the individual prices, the bundle price is as follows:

[table-ebay-fulfillment-example-bundle]]
.Example calculation of a bundle
[cols="1,3,3"]
|====

| *Item* | *Unit price* | *Total price*

|Dining room chair

|Price x 4 = EUR 239.96

|Dining room table
|EUR 299.99
|EUR 299.99

|

[#350]
=== Setting up the labels

Now set up item labels. An item label is a note that you stick to the item or item packaging later.

[.instruction]
Setting up the label:

. Open the *Setup » Item » Labels* menu in your plentymarkets back end.
. Expand the *New template* section.
. Enter the name *EBFSKU Item Labels*.

*_Note that the following values are only given as an example. It might therefore be necessary to adjust the values to your label printer._*

. For the page, enter *80* and *40*.
. For the margin, enter *10* and *5*.
. For the label, enter *70* and *35*.
. For *Lines per page*, enter the value *1*.
. For *Columns per page*, enter the value *1*.
. For *Item ID*, enter the value *25* under *X* and the value *32* under *Y*. Select *5px* and *Normal* from the drop-down lists.
. Make the following settings in the *GTIN Barcode* line: +
→ e.g. for the coordinates and the mm specifications: X = 3, Y = 2, 25 mm, 25 mm (these are example values; here you must then check whether the distances for label printing fit visually) +
→ from the *GTIN* drop-down list, select the *EBFSKU* option +
→ from the drop-down list *Format*, select the option *CODE128* +
→ place a check mark next to the option *Display GTIN*
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

Furthermore, you have the possibility to determine in the same menu, which item-related information you want to add to the label. Also in this case, you have to make sure that the position needs to carried out according to the settings of your label printer.

Possible selection fields (<<image-label-template>>) are:

* Language
* Item ID
* Variation ID
* Variation no.
* Variation name
* External variation ID
* Model
* Main variation ID
* Item name

By activating the option *Hide title*, you determine whether the title of the field should also be displayed (e.g. “Language: English”).

[[image-label-template]]

image::fulfilment/assets/eBay-Fulfillment-label-template.png[width=640, height=360]

[#360]
=== Inbound

[#370]
==== What does inbound mean?

Inbound means that you supply eBay Fulfillment with items that they then deliver to your customers. The term inbound covers 2 aspects:

. first, it describes the transmission of data to eBay Fulfillment in the form of an advice note (goods delivery announcement)
. on the other hand, it is the process of physical goods receipt that you transfer from your warehouse to the warehouse of eBay Fulfillment

*_Note that following the given order is absolutely necessary for the correct processing with eBay Fulfillment._*

[#380]
==== Creating an inbound order

By deploying the eBay Fulfillment plugin, a contact record of eBay Fulfillment (e.g. Fiege) is automatically created in the menu *CRM » Contacts*.

Create an inbound order with the recipient address of your fulfilment service provider. To create an order manually, search (icon:search[role="blue"]) for the contact in the menu *CRM » Contacts*.

Enter the name in the *Name* field (e.g. Fiege). Open the contact record and create a new order by clicking on *New order* on the left side.

Add the items to the order that you want to send to your fulfilment service provider and set the <<fulfilment/ebay-fulfillment#630, item price to 0 EUR>>. *Save* the order.

[[image-item-price-to-zero]]
.Example of how to set the item price to 0 EUR in an inbound order
image::fulfilment/assets/eBay-Fulfillment-item-price-zero.png[width=640, height=360]

If the order contains all items as desired, set the order status to *eBay Fulfillment Inbound*. The automatic status change to *eBay Fulfillment Inbound sent* informs you that you can book the outgoing items in the respective order in the *Orders » Settings* menu.

*Important:* It is absolutely necessary that your own warehouse is set in the order as the item warehouse. Your own warehouse is the outgoing warehouse that is used to send stock to eBay. If you do not select your own warehouse, incorrect stock movements will occur.

[[image-book-outgoing-items]]
.Booking outgoing items after the status change to *eBay Fulfillment Inbound sent*
image::fulfilment/assets/eBay-Fulfillment-book-outgoing-items.png[width=640, height=360]

[WARNING]
.Do not create the delivery note at the order
====
Do not create the delivery note at the order, but as described in chapter <<fulfilment/ebay-fulfillment#410, Inbound packages>>. Otherwise, the fulfilment service provider cannot stock the items.
====

[#390]
==== Generating and applying labels

Now create the EBFSKU labels in the order in the *Receipts* tab. Then print the labels and stick them on the items. To do so, proceed as described below.

[.instruction]
Generating the label:

. In the plentymarkets back end, go to *Orders » Edit orders*.
. Open the order that you want to send to eBay Fulfillment.
. Click on the *Receipts* tab.
. Select an option from the *Item labels* drop-down list. +
→ The label is created.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the label on your computer.

Then print the label using an appropriate label printer and stick the label on the order items you want to send to eBay Fulfillment.

[#400]
==== Sending advice notes to the fulfilment service provider

To automatically send the advice notes (goods delivery notification) to eBay Fulfillment, you must manually change the status of the order. To do so, open the order and change the status to *[5.3] eBay Fulfillment Inbound*. In case of a successful transmission, the order is automatically moved to the status *eBay Fulfillment Inbound sent*.

[#410]
==== Inbound packages

. In the plentymarkets back end, go to *Setup » Orders » Shipping » Fulfillment » eBay Fulfillment » Inbound Packages*.
. Enter the order ID.
. Click on *Search* (icon:search[role="blue"]).
. Click on *URL* in the line of the order. +
→ A file is generated and downloaded.
. Print the file and put it into the package.

Once you have carried out all the settings, there's nothing to stop your items from being stored in the eBay Fulfillment warehouse. To ensure a smooth transition, note that the notified quantity of items corresponds to the actual quantity of items shipped to the eBay Fulfillment warehouse.

[#420]
== Outbound

[#430]
=== What does outbound mean?

The term outbound describes the sales and distribution process that the fulfilment service provider takes over for you: It packs the items, stores them temporarily and then sends them to your customers.

[#440]
=== Sending the first item

As soon as stock was booked in the warehouse of eBay Fulfillment, the stock in the eBay Fulfillment warehouse will automatically be updated in your plentymarkets system. From this moment on and on condition that all settings in your plentymarkets system were carried out correctly, it is possible to transmit the first order to eBay Fulfillment.

If you have received orders for the same item that you sold from your own warehouse in the past, the plentymarkets system does not transmit an order to eBay Fulfillment. Only does the transmission take place when eBay Fulfillment updates the stock for the corresponding warehouse.

If you have already decided to <<fulfilment/ebay-fulfillment#250, send the eBay Fulfillment outbound orders automatically>>, nothing stands in the way of processing eBay Fulfillment orders. If you prefer sending the orders manually, proceed as described in the following steps.

[#450]
=== Manually sending an outbound order to eBay Fulfillment (standard process)

After receipt of an order in your plentymarkets system and payment of the order, the order is automatically set to status *[5] Cleared for shipping*, provided the items have sufficient stock. From here, you can manually forward the orders to eBay Fulfillment as follows:

. In the plentymarkets back end, go to *Orders » Edit orders*.
. Filter in the left section under *Warehouse* according to the eBay Fulfillment distribution warehouse you have named, e.g.: *eBay Fulfillment Sales*.
. Click on *Search* (icon:search[role="blue"]). +
→ An overview of all orders that you process via eBay Fulfillment is displayed.
. Open the order by clicking on the order ID.
. Select in the *Overview* tab in the *Status* section the previously created status *eBay Fulfillment Outbound* from the drop-down list. +
→ The order moves from here to the status *eBay Fulfillment Outbound sent* or *eBay Fulfillment Outbound not sent*.

*_Note:_* If the order could not be sent, check the settings or have a look in the chapter <<fulfilment/ebay-fulfillment#480, FAQ/Troubleshooting>>.

[#460]
=== Order splitting

Initial situation: An order contains 2 items A and B. Item A is in an own warehouse and item B is in the eBay Fulfillment warehouse. +
→ The items are split into different delivery orders.

[#470]
==== Splitting the delivery orders according to the item availability

Go to *Setup » Orders » Settings* and select from the line *Assignment of warehouses* the setting *b) a warehouse can be assigned for each stock unit* and in the line *Automatic warehouse selection* the setting *d) depending on the warehouse priority and the highest stock level*.

. Open the menu *Setup » Orders » Events* in your plentymarkets back end.
. Click on *Add event procedure* (icon:plus-square[role="green"]).
. Enter the desired name for the event procedure, e.g. *eBay Fulfillment splitting*.

*_Triggering event_*

. From the *Event* drop-down list, select the option *Order change > Status change (shipping preparation)*.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

*_Filter criteria for orders_*

. Select the filter *Order > Order type*.
. Click on *Add*.
. Activate the option *Order*.

. Click on *Add filter* (icon:plus-square[role="green"]).
. Select the filter *Order > Order warehouse*.
. Click on *Add*.
. Activate the option *Several warehouses per order* in the filter.

*_Executing procedure_*

. Click on *Add procedure* (icon:plus-square[role="green"]).
. Select the procedure *Order > Generate delivery orders*.
. Click on *Add*.

. Place a check mark next to the word *Active* to activate the event procedure.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

[#480]
== FAQ/Troubleshooting

[WARNING]
.Contact the eBay Customer Support in the following cases
====
Please contact the eBay Customer Support when the following causes occur: +

* Orders that have already been transmitted to Fiege should be cancelled
* Package number is not visible in the order
* Stock differences +
(If you have determined that more/less stock is available in the warehouse than stated in the plentymarkets back end, then you can contact eBay that they ask Fiege about the current stock level.)
* Returning goods
* Labelling service
* General questions about the eBay Fulfillment contract
====

[#490]
=== No EBSFKU saved in the item

Possible causes for this are listed in the following:

[#500]
==== The item is not activated for eBay Fulfillment

Go to *Items » Edit item* and search (icon:search[]) for the item. Open the item and check if the options *eBay Fulfillment* and *WEB API* are activated under *Availability*. After this is done, it might take up to an hour until the EBFSKU will be automatically saved in the item.

[#510]
==== Check the token

Check whether the token/your accounts are activated. If not, update the token in the menu *Setup » Markets » eBay » Accounts* and in the menu *Setup » Markets » eBay » OAuth2*.
Afterwards, go to *Plugins » Plugin overview* and save the plugin set once again. Select the active set and save the settings.

The EBFSKUs will be automatically saved in the item after approx. 1 hour.

[#520]
==== Password changed

If you have changed your eBay password, it is required that you update your eBay account and the eBay OAuth2 account in plentymarkets as well.

[#530]
==== Pay attention to version updates

Pay attention if version updated are available and update the plugin in the *Plugins » Plugin overview* menu.

[#540]
=== Negative stock or stock differences

To avoid negative stock or stock differences in your plentymarkets system, make sure that your basic warehouse settings are correct.

[#550]
==== Unilateral sale

Your warehouse in the listing is the warehouse *eBay Fulfillment Sales*. With this setting, you make sure that this eBay item is only sold via the warehouse *eBay Fulfillment Sales*.

[#560]
==== Multi-Channel

If you sell this item also via other platforms, you can define your warehouse settings according to your individual requirements. To do so, use the warehouse selection and warehouse priorities.

Select as warehouse in the listing the option *Use basic settings*. The basic warehouse settings are carried out in the *Setup » Orders » Settings* menu.

A correct selection of the stock dependency in the eBay listing is also required for an ideal warehouse selection. For further information, refer to the chapter <<welcome/quick-start/quick-start-ebay#2800, Creating listings>> in the plentymarkets quick start.

*Important note:*
If you would like to exclude markets for eBay Fulfillment, do this by deactivating the referrers in the warehouse settings. To do so, go to *Setup » Stock » Warehouse* » _Select warehouse_ » *Settings*.

[#570]
=== Common inbound mistakes

Possible causes for this are listed in the following.

[#580]
==== Not possible to add items to the inbound order

If items cannot be found in the search when creating an inbound order, check whether the referrer *Manual entry* is activated for the price linked in the item.

Go to *Setup » Items » Sales price* _here price for eBay_ to carry out the settings.

[[image-manual-entry-referrer-sales-price]]
.Activating the manual referrer at the sales prices
image::fulfilment/assets/eBay-Fulfillment-sales-price.png[width=640, height=360]

[#590]
==== Warehouse selection for inbound order

When manually creating an order for the fulfilment service provider, please do “NOT” select *eBay Fulfillment Sales* or *eBay Fulfillment Exception* as warehouse.

*_These warehouses are only managed by eBay Fulfillment._*

Select for the order the warehouse from which you want to take and book the items for shipment to the fulfilment service provider.

[#600]
==== Order is stuck in status "eBay Fulfillment Inbound"

A possible cause for this pending change of the status *Inbound* to *Inbound sent* or *Inbound not sent* is a missing standard shipping profile. This is saved in the *Setup » Client » Standard client » Orders* menu.

[[image-select-standard-shipping-profile]]
.Select the standard shipping profile
image::fulfilment/assets/eBay-Fulfillment-select-standard-shipping-profile.png[width=640, height=360]

The user must also have the necessary editing rights. You find this setting in the *Setup » Settings » User » Rights » User* menu. Enter the search criteria, open the corresponding user name and in the section *Rights*, click on the small grey arrow next to *Orders*. Activate the rights as you can see as an example in the following image.

[[image-activate-user-rights]]
.Activating user rights
image::fulfilment/assets/eBay-Fulfillment-activate-user-rights.png[width=640, height=360]

[#610]
==== Inbound not sent

All items/variations of the order must be <<fulfilment/ebay-fulfillment#310, active>> and must have an EBFSKU. Otherwise, the inbound order cannot be sent.

[#620]
==== Not possible to transfer inbound order

Check whether you subsequently made changes to the items in the order and/or whether further items were subsequently added to the order.

If the shipping packages have already been created - order search in the shipping centre with filters that apply also to the inbound order -, subsequent changes to the order cannot be applied automatically for the shipping packages, e.g. items could be “missing”.

Therefore, it is necessary that you delete the shipping packages for this order in the shipping centre. In case of a new search or when updating the search, the shipping packages are again generated automatically with the current data from the order.

If no subsequent changes were made to the order, check whether shipping packages were manually added to the order via the shipping centre or via a process. These cannot be filled with items automatically; empty shipping packages, however, are rejected by the API.

If you should require further shipping packages to register the inbound order with a fulfilment service provider, you can do this after transmission of the inbound order to the fulfilment service provider. This is possible because currently only the “total content” spread on the packages is decisive. Empty shipping packages are not allowed.

If this solution is not suitable for you, the package content list would be useful for this purpose since you can fill the packages according to your needs. Thus, you can exactly determine how many packages should be used and which number of items may be contained in the packages.

However, you must ensure that no shipping packages were generated automatically beforehand. This is due to the fact that the automatic generation cannot work smoothly in line with the package content list.
Delete the shipping packages that have already been created in the shipping centre, if necessary. This allows you to generate new shipping packages via the package content list.
As soon as one shipping package at least was created via the package content list, the automatism for the generation of shipping packages in the shipping centre does no longer apply for the order.

[#630]
==== Sales figures

Remember to set the item prices in the order to 0.00 EUR. By doing so, you make sure that the inbound orders do not have an influence on your sales figures.

[#640]
==== Stock maintenance

Once the inbound order was sent, you can manually book the outgoing items in the order or have them booked via an event procedure.

*Important note:*
If you change the settings in your system and manually change the status of the inbound order, e.g. to move the order again to the desired status after having made a correction in the order to control whether a possible error could be solved by means of the settings changes, then please note the following:

By *manually changing/moving the order status*, the automated events may no longer apply. Therefore, it could be the case that an event procedure that should book the outgoing items automatically does no longer apply. Therefore, you must manually book the outgoing items in the order.

[#650]
==== Not possible to change the status

If it is not possible to change the status, the outgoing items might have been already booked (status ≥ 7). Or the required user rights are not activated (see chapter <<fulfilment/ebay-fulfillment#600, Order is stuck in status "eBay Fulfillment Inbound">>).

The outgoing items booked can be reset in the order in the *Settings* tab in the section *Outgoing items* by clicking on *Reset*. After having carried out this setting, the order can again be set to status *5* and afterwards to the status *eBay Fulfillment Inbound*.  The order then moves to status *Inbound sent* automatically.

[#660]
==== Inbound: Difference between advice note and physical shipment

*Under-delivery:*

You have sent an <<fulfilment/ebay-fulfillment#370, advice note (goods delivery announcement)>> with your plentymarkets system to eBay Fulfillment. In this notification, you transfer a delivery of 15 pieces of a certain item. Actually, you only send only 13 pieces, however.

In order that the quantity is correct in the warehouse of eBay Fulfillment and that you can avoid deficiencies on your side, you simply forward the missing items to the warehouse of eBay Fulfillment.
→ In this case, 2 pieces.

*Over-delivery:*

If you have sent more items to the warehouse of eBay Fulfillment than notified before, send an advice note with the difference amount to your fulfilment service provider in order to synchronise the difference in the system.

[#670]
=== Common outbound mistakes

[#680]
==== Was the shipping release transmitted to Fiege?

Open the *Orders » Edit orders* menu. Search (icon:search[role="blue"]) for the order and open it. In the order, click on the *Properties* tab. If there is a value for *EbayFiege: Outbound Order ID* (e.g: _PL-XXXXX-123456_), then the outbound order has been successfully transmitted.

If you have any questions afterwards, please contact the eBay CS (Customer Support).

[#690]
=== Outbound not sent

[#700]
==== Token no longer valid

See chapter <<fulfilment/ebay-fulfillment#510, Check the token>>.

[#710]
==== User rights not activated

See chapter <<fulfilment/ebay-fulfillment#600, Order is stuck in status "eBay Fulfillment Inbound">>.

[#720]
==== Tracking by means of logs (example: Packstation)

If the status of an order changes to *eBay Fulfillment Inbound not sent* or *eBay Fulfillment Outbound not sent*, you can have a look in the log for further details:

. In the plentymarkets back end, go to *Data » Log*.
. In the filter section on the left side, enter the plugin name *EbayFiege* in the field *Integration*.
. Enter the log level *Error* in the field *Level*.
. Click on *Search* (icon:search[role="blue"]).

After you have carried out the search, all events that were carried out on the system as well as their results will be listed. With the help of the *timestamp* when the status change was carried out in your order, you can find the corresponding log in the overview. When clicking on the desired log, a pop-up window opens where you can see the first details. By clicking on *Expand all* or on the arrow next to the last line, further details are displayed. In the last line of this report, you obtain the information that led to the status change.

*Example:*

You have transmitted an outbound order to eBay Fulfillment and the address contains a packstation, this outbound order will be refused automatically after the transmission since eBay Fulfillment does not deliver to packstations. The status of this order changes to *eBay Fulfillment outbound not sent*. By means of the time when the status was changed in the order, you can have a look in the list and search for the corresponding log entry. After clicking in the line of the log entry, the following information is displayed:

[[image-log-entry]]
.Log entry
image::fulfilment/assets/eBay-Fulfillment-log-entry.png[width=640, height=360]

In the last line that opens by clicking the arrow, you obtain detailed information that the outbound order could not be sent since the stated destination address is not supported by eBay Fulfillment.

[#730]
==== Change or cancel outbound

If the outbound has already been sent to eBay Fulfillment, the order should not be changed, for example to send the shipment by yourself. In order to obtain the editing status from the fulfilment service provider or to stop the order from being edited, contact the eBay Customer Support.

Currently, it is not possible to cancel the outbound order via the interface. Therefore, this has to be discussed with the eBay CS.
Cancelling the outbound order in the system does not result in the order being cancelled with Fiege.

=== Order transmission to eBay Fulfillment is delayed

If the transmission of order to eBay Fulfillment is delayed, this could be caused by the settings of incoming PayPal payments.

Therefore, check the following points:

[#750]
==== Time zone

Log in to your PayPal account and check whether the time zone is correctly set. To do so, open this link:https://www.paypal.com/businessprofile/mysettings[PayPal link^]{nbsp}icon:external-link[]. The time zone should display *(CET01:00) Central European Time (Berlin, Paris, Rome)*.

[#760]
==== Immediate Payment Notifications

Log into your PayPal account and use this link:https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/customerprofileweb?cmd=_profile-ipn-notify[Link^]{nbsp}icon:external-link[] to check if Immediate Payment Notifications are activated. If the function is activated, enter the URL of your plentymarkets system there.

The URL is structured as follows:

*+https://www.MEINE-SHOP-ADRESSE.de/plenty/api/payment_notification.php?payment=PayPal+*

Replace *www.MY-PLENTYSTORE.co.uk* with your own domain.

Once you have saved these settings, completed payments are immediately transmitted to your system by PayPal and some transactions can be shipped considerably faster in the future.
