== Exporting a list of delivery addresses

If you ship packages with a shipping service provider, you need a list of delivery addresses. This list is an export of shipping information that you have to hand over to your shipping service providers, so that they, in return, can provide you with valid shipping labels. This export allows to get larger quantities of packages ready for shipment quickly and easily. In the following, you learn how to export your orders' delivery addresses into a file, which you need for your shipping service provider's software.

If you have questions about importing the file into the shipping service provider's software or about using the software itself, please contact the provider.

[.instruction]
Exporting a list of delivery addresses:

. Go to *Orders » Fulfilment*.
. Expand the area *List of delivery addresses*.
. Carry out the settings. Pay attention to the information given in <<table-export-list-of-delivery-address>>.
. Click on the gear-wheel icon. +
→ You receive a file which you should save on your computer.
. Afterwards, import the file with your shipping service provider's software.

== Importing package numbers

Use the menu *Orders » Fulfilment » Tab: Import of package numbers* to easily edit large quantities of package numbers in your plentymarkets system.

The *Import of package numbers* tab is divided into the areas *CSV import* and *List import*. In the *CSV import* area, you upload a file of your shipping service provider in your plentymarkets system. In the *List import* area, you can manually enter the package numbers with the corresponding order IDs or you can import the package numbers and order IDs by using a <<fulfilment/generating-documents#1010, barcode scanner>>.

[#900]
=== Importing package numbers with a CSV file

Proceed as follows to import the package numbers with a CSV file. The CSV file that you import was generated by your shipping service provider.

[.instruction]
Importing package numbers with a CSV file:

[#1000]
=== Manually importing package numbers

In the *Orders » Fulfilment » Tab: Import of package numbers* menu in the *List import* area, you can manually enter the package numbers with the corresponding order ID. Alternatively, you can use a barcode scanner to scan these from the packing list. You find a description of how to use the barcode scanner in the next chapter.

[#1010]
=== Importing package numbers with the help of a barcode scanner

The outgoing items should be booked in plentymarkets once an order is finished being packed. Here, the *Status [7] Outgoing items booked* are saved for the order and the current date is saved as the date for the outgoing items. For example, this operation can be carried out by scanning the barcode on the invoice, delivery note, packing list or the address label. Pay attention to the correct configuration of your barcode scanner.

The following example describes the scanning process of the packing list.

[.instruction]
Importing package numbers with the help of a barcode scanner:

. Go to *Orders » Fulfilment*.
. Expand the area *Generating invoices*.
. Generate one or multiple invoices. For further information, refer to the explanations on the <<orders/order-documents/generating-invoices#, Generating invoices>> page of the manual.
. Create a packing list from these invoices for all orders that need to be packed this time. For further information, refer to the explanations on the <<orders/order-documents/packing-list#, Packing list>> page of the manual.
. As soon as a package has been packed, mark this order on the packing list.
. Additionally, place another small sticker with the package number (light label) underneath the order ID's barcode.
. Go to *Orders » Fulfilment*.
. Click on the *Import of package numbers* tab.
. Place the cursor in the first field in the *List import* area.
. First scan the order ID and afterwards the package number. +
→ By clicking on *Save*, the package numbers is saved for all orders in the *Settings* tab.

Set up an event procedure in the *System » Orders » Event procedures* menu. Select the procedure *Order > Book outgoing items* for the event *Order change > Package number*. Furthermore, you can send your customers an email template including the package number and the link for tracking the package. For further information, refer to the <<basics/automation/event-procedures#, Event procedures>> page of the manual.

[#300]
== Setting up the address label

In contrast to shipping labels, you can precisely define which information should be displayed for address labels in plentymarkets and where it should be positioned on the label. These address labels do not yet include the shipping charges or the shipment numbers, as they were not generated by the shipping provider. Using address labels is especially recommended in certain situations. For example, when shipping books, it is sometimes possible to write book mail on the package and ship it for a cheaper price than the weight of the package. In plentymarkets, you can configure the address label templates, generate a PDF file and use it to print labels.

[TIP]
.When does it make sense to use the software of a parcel service?
====
Generate address labels in plentymarkets to send your items. If you would like to ship packages with a parcel service, we recommend that you use the software of the parcel service in order to print shipping labels.
====

If you have already created an address label template and saved a PDF template, continue with chapter <<fulfilment/generating-documents#700, Generating the address label>>.

[#400]
=== Creating an address label template

Before being able to print address labels, you must create a template. Proceed as described below to create a new template.

[.instruction]
Creating an address label template:

. Go to *System » Orders » Documents » Address label*.
. Click on the *New template* tab.
. Carry out the settings. Pay attention to the information given in <<table-create-address-label-template>>.
. *Save* the settings.

[IMPORTANT]
