Create categories of the type Item to organize your items in the online store. Consider which products are included in your portfolio and divide these products into groups of categories and subcategories. For example, you could use **Women's clothing** and **Men's clothing** as main categories and then use **Shoes** as a subcategory of each one. Or you could set up categories the other way around. You could use **Shoes** as a main category and have it include the subcategories **Women's** and **Men's**. Set up the categories that best match your portfolio. +
For further information about creating **main categories** and **subcategories**, refer to the **<<item/categories/editing-categories#, Editing categories  >>** page of the manual. This page also includes additional settings that apply to other category types, i.e. to Item, Content and Container.
