== General information

If you want to make your online store available in several different languages, then you will also need to create categories in these languages. This page explains how to create multilingual categories of the type **Content**, the type **Item** and the type **Container**. Of course, this is assuming that you have already created categories in your online store's default language. Proceed as described on the **<<item/categories/editing-categories#1, Editing categories >>** page of the manual to create categories in the default language. For further information about the requirements of a multilingual online store, refer to the **<<omni-channel/online-store/setting-up-clients/multilingual-online-store#, Multilingualism  >>** page of the manual. You can find best practice tips on the **<<omni-channel/online-store/setting-up-clients/multilingual-online-store#, Multilingual online store  >>** page of the manual.

== Creating multilingual category pages

There are two ways to create multilingual categories. You can choose between a multilingual or a monolingual editor. Use the monolingual editor to edit one language version after another. Use the multilingual editor to edit two languages at a time. Both procedures are described below.

=== Monolingual editor

Proceed as described below to create a language version of an existing category.
