== General information about categories of the type Content

Set up categories of the type **Content** to give your customers additional information about your store, terms and conditions, etc. Some categories are already available in your system, e.g. the **Terms and conditions**, **Content** and **About us** pages. Simply edit these pages to meet your needs. You could use a category called **Payment methods** as a main category and have it include the subcategories **PayPal**, **Skrill**, etc. Decide for yourself which information should be available to your customers. +
For further information about creating **main categories** and **subcategories**, refer to the **<<item/categories/editing-categories#, Editing categories>>** page of the manual. This page also includes additional settings that apply to other category types, i.e. to **Item**, **Content** and **Container**. Categories of the types **Content** and **Container** are easily recognized by their yellow folder and page symbols.

[IMPORTANT]
.No renaming for default category Content
====
You can neither change the **name** nor the **URL name** of the category **Content**. You can change settings that do not relate to the name such as the position. You can not create further categories called Content.
====

== Editing categories of the type Content

The following configuration only focuses on those settings that are absolutely necessary for categories of the type **Content** and that differ from the settings for categories of the type **Item**. For further information about the remaining settings, refer to __**table 2**__ on the **<<item/categories/editing-categories#, Editing categories>>** page of the manual.

[.instruction]
Editing content categories:

. Open the desired category in the directory tree on the left.
. Select **Content** as the type. +
→ New categories will automatically be assigned to the type **Item** (default).
. Click on the **save icon** to save the settings.

== Inserting a category of the type Content into the online store's design

There are several different ways to insert the categories of the type **Content** that you created into the online store. The following examples illustrate two different possibilities.

=== Inserting an individual category

You will first learn how to insert an individual category.

[.instruction]
Inserting an individual category into the design:

. Go to **CMS » Web design » Layout**.
. Select which template you want to insert the category into. +
→ The **PageDesignContent** template is used in the example.
. Click on the **PageDesignContentMainFrame** tab.
. Insert the template function **Link(ID) %}** into an appropriate place in the layout (see the following code example and image 1).
. Click on the **save icon** to save the settings.

In the following example, the category was inserted into the upper navigation bar (image 1).

[IMPORTANT]
.Insert the category ID
====
Replace **ID** in the code example with the category **ID**.
====

The tooltip (image 1, number 2) is the text in quotation marks in the code example. The name (image 1, number 1) is directly behind this in the code example.

=== Displaying a category within a different category

You can use template functions to display the **content of one category** within another category. Insert the template function **CategoryContentBody(ID) %}** (ID = ID of the category that is to be displayed) at the desired position in the category. For example, this allows you to display your terms and conditions in another category without actually inserting the category.

=== Inserting all categories of the type Content

[.instruction]
Inserting all categories of the type content into the design:

. Go to **CMS » Web design » Layout**.
. Select which template you want to insert the category into.
. → The **PageDesignContent** template is used in the example.
. Click on the **PageDesignContentMainFrame** tab.
. Insert the template function **Container_NavigationCategories() %}** into an appropriate place in the layout (image 2). +
→ Insert the template function of whichever navigation you use for categories of the type **Content** (see note below).
. Click on the **save icon** to save the settings.

[IMPORTANT]
.Specify the category type for the navigation
====
Go to **CMS » Web design » Layout » Navigation** to access the various designs for the category navigation. Open the design that you use for categories of the type **Content** and click on the **Settings** tab. Make sure that the type **Content** was also selected here. +
If you use a plentymarkets standard design, then **NavigationCategories4** is already set up for categories of the type **Content**. You can change this as desired.
