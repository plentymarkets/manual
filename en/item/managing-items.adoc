:position: 10

Create items and item variations for your products in plentymarkets. Items can be sold in your <<omni-channel/online-store/setting-up-clients#, online-store>> and on the many <<omni-channel/multi-channel#, markets>> integrated with plentymarkets.

First, you will learn how to update product information for your items. Create <<item/managing-items#390, attributes>>, <<item/managing-items#480, properties>>, <<item/managing-items#560, manufacturers>> and <<item/managing-items#630, barcodes>>. Link this information with your items. Furthermore, you find information and tips for structuring <<item/managing-items#870, sales prices>> for your items and variations. <<item/managing-items#910, Price calculations>> will also be explained. Price calculations allow you to customise and graduate prices for different customer classes as well as referrers.

Next, get familiar with the plentymarkets 7 item architecture. A <<item/managing-items#20, default item>> consists of global settings and data of the main variation as well as additional variations>>. Global settings apply to all variations of the **Default** item. Information saved with the main variation is passed on to additional variations. However, you can change the settings of every variation individually.

Finally, learn how to create <<item/managing-items#920, item bundles>> for items and
// or as <strong><a href="#2080.">item sets</a></strong>
variations. How to present your products in the most favourable way using <<items/managing-items#950, cross-selling>> will also be explained.

[#390]
== Managing attributes

Certain items, such as shoes and T-shirts, are typically available in different sizes and colours. Some items are available in different quantities, e.g. 50 ml or 250 ml. In plentymarkets, these characteristics of an item are called attributes. Attributes allow you to create variations of an item.

[#400]
=== Creating attributes

Create attributes as well as attribute values and link this information with your items and variations.

[.instruction]
Creating a new attribute:

. Go to **System » Item » Attributes**.
. Click on **New attribute**.
. Enter the internal name.
. Click on **Save**. +
→ The attribute is created and the tab **Basic settings** is displayed.
. Carry out additional settings as desired. Pay attention to the information given in <<table-creating-attributes>>.

* Comma
* Colon
* Semicolon
* Quotation marks

|**Position**
|Select the attribute's position for displaying it in the attribute overview.

|**Image link possible**
|Activate to assign appropriate item images to the variations of an item. Depending on the customer's choice, the corresponding images will automatically be displayed in the online store.

|**Attribute selection in the online store**
|Select **Select with a drop-down list**, **Select with an image** or **Select with a box**. +
**Select with an image** = Select attributes by clicking on the image. Attributes are displayed as image tiles in the online store. For further information about attribute images, refer to the <<item/managing-items#450, Uploading attribute images>> chapter. +
**Select with a box** = Select attributes by selecting a box. Attributes are displayed as boxes with attribute values in the online store. This setting is only possible when **Client check** was selected for the attribute's availability. For further information, refer to the <<client-store/standard/item-layouts/basic-settings#, Basic settings>> page of the manual.

|**Groupable in item lists**
|You can use the <<omni-channel/online-store/setting-up-clients/cms-syntax#web-design-itemview-container-itemviewcategorieslist, ItemViewCategoriesList>> template to display the available item variations. Specify the attribute which is used for displaying item variations, e.g. select the attribute **Colour** for shoes. In this way, all colour variations will be displayed first. After selecting the colour, the second attribute will be available in a drop-down list in the detailed view of an item, e.g. the **size**. The **$ItemViewCategoriesList_GroupByVariation** option is found in the settings of the template. Here you can select if you want to group by attributes or by variations.

[#480]
== Managing properties

Properties are characteristics of an item. Unlike attributes, properties are passive characteristics, i.e. they are not required to create variations. Besides, properties cannot be selected in the detailed view of an item in the online store. With properties, you can highlight features of items, e.g. technical details such as Bluetooth or Wi-Fi, etc. Properties are passive characteristics which are not connected to stock. By using order properties, you can provide services for an additional charge or integrate a text field for a customer's additional requests. When setting up the property search, you can use properties to provide your customers with a more specific search. Properties also allow you to link your items with the properties for variations of a market.

[#490]
=== Creating property groups

Create property groups to sort your properties into groups. By using property groups, you keep track of large numbers of properties. When linking items with properties, the properties will be displayed in the assigned property groups.

[.instruction]
Creating a new property group:

. Go to **System » Item » Properties**.
. Click on the **New property group** tab.
. Carry out the settings as desired. Pay attention to the information given in <<table-creating-property-groups>>.
. **Save** the settings.

[#3000]
== Managing variation properties

Properties are frequently occurring information that you can use in different areas of plentymarkets. Properties are centrally managed in the *System » Settings » Properties* menu and can be used in the following areas of plentymarkets:

* Contacts
* Item

Properties of the *Item* area are linked to variations. As such, these properties are different from the old properties, which are linked at the item level. You can create up to 500 variation properties and link them to variations.

In contrast to attributes, properties are passive, i.e. they cannot be used to create variations. With properties, you can highlight recurring features of variations, e.g. technical details such as Bluetooth or Wi-Fi. Properties are not linked to stock and also cannot be selected in the detailed view of an item in the online store.

Properties allow you to provide services for an additional charge or integrate a text field that customers can use to enter additional information. Properties also allow you to link your items with the properties for variations of a market. Use the property search to find variations that are linked to a specific property.

[IMPORTANT]
.Important notes about the variation properties
====
However, you can create properties in the *System » Settings » Properties* menu and also add values for the properties. You can also link these properties to variations in the *Item » Edit item » Open item » Open variation » Tab: Properties* menu. However, at this point in time you can only view the variation properties in the plentymarkets back end. The variation properties cannot be viewed in the online store or transferred to markets. These features will be available soon.

|Setting |Explanation

|**GTIN 8; +
GTIN 13; +
GTIN 14; +
GTIN 128**
|The Global Trade Item Number (formerly European Article Number, EAN) is a product barcode for items. The GTIN consists of 8, 13, 14 or a maximum of 128 characters and is centrally administered and issued for manufacturers upon request.

|**ISBN**
|The International Standard Book Number is a unique number of 10 or 13 characters to register books and other independent, discontinuous publications like multimedia products and software.

|**QR**
|Quick Response Code. The code contains data such as the version, the data format and other information.

|**CODE 128**
|Alphanumeric barcode. The Code128 consists of start character, encoded data, check character and stop character.

|**UPC**
|The Universal Product Code is a product barcode for items. The UPC is a 12-digit number. By adding a leading **0**, this barcode can be used as a 13-digit GTIN.
|====

[#645]
=== Finding duplicate barcodes

It is possible to save identical barcode codes for more than one variation. If you do not want to work with duplicate codes, you can search for and correct any duplicate codes in the system. The search is designed to locate identical codes of the same barcode type that are saved for different variations.

[.instruction]

. Click on the variation you want to edit. +
→ The variation opens.
. Edit the variation's code.
. **Save** the variation settings.

[#650]
=== Setting up GTIN numbering

Many sellers do not have GTIN s (barcodes) for their items because they directly import their items and the manufacturer does not assign a GTIN. In such cases, you can purchase GTINs from GS1 Germany and use these GTINs e.g. on the markets <<omni-channel/multi-channel/amazon#, Amazon>> or <<omni-channel/multi-channel/real-de#, real.de>>. 13-digit GTINs (formerly EAN) consist of the basic group, the item reference and the check digit. The basic group has 7 to 9 digits and contains the GS1 prefix with the country code, e.g. 500 to 509 for the UK, as well as the company number. The item reference of the manufacturer consists of 3 to 5 digits (depending on the basic group's length). The check digit is the last digit.

[.instruction]
Setting up GTIN numbering:

. Go to **System » Item » GTIN**.
. Enter the starting value. +
→ For 13 digit GTINs this must be a 12 digit value. The check digit is entered automatically.
. Enter the number of GTINs.
. **Save** the settings.

Assign the GTINs generated with GTIN numbering to your items in the <<item/managing-items#250, Barcodes>> area in the **Item » Edit item » Open item » Open variation » Tab: Settings** menu. Select the correct GTIN type and click on **Generate GTIN** in the **Code** column of this type. The next available GTIN is inserted into the **Code** field automatically. To generate GTINs for several variations at the same time, use the <<item/managing-items#330, Variation group function>> or <<item/managing-items#330, Variation batch processing>>.

[#680]
=== Uploading item images via FTP server

Every plentymarkets system has its own <<basics/data-exchange/ftp-access#, FTP server>>. This FTP server contains the folder **upload_article_image_XXXX** (XXXX = plentyID) to which you can upload item images. The folder is checked for changes every 60 minutes. New, correctly named images are assigned to the correct item automatically. To upload files, you need an FTP program and your FTP login details.

==== Naming of item image files for FTP import

Go to **System » Item » Images** and use the option **Image names of the FTP import** to choose whether the file names of the imported item images include the item ID or the variation No. Depending on this setting, you either name the files with the item ID or the variation No.

[NOTE]
.Valid characters for file names
====
The following characters are supported for image file names:

* Letters (a-z, A-Z) excluding umlauts
* Numbers (0-9)
* Underscores (_)
* Hyphens (-)

Spaces and special characters are not permitted. When you upload images, spaces and special characters are replaced by hyphens (-).
====

If you want to upload several images for one item, number the files by adding suffixes. You have to separate the image number from the item ID or variation No. with three hyphens, i.e. **---**. You can upload up to 100 images per item by numbering them from 0 to 99.

[.instruction]
Example:

You want to upload images for an item with item ID 4562 and the variation number AQ3957.

== Creating variations

A main variation is always created when a new **Default** item is created. The main variation is linked permanently to the **Default** item. It cannot be deleted. Information saved for the main variation, such as sales prices and availability, is passed on to item variations. However, you can change the settings of every variation individually. First, learn how to create variations.

[.instruction]
Create new variations:

. Go to **Item » Edit item**.
. Open the **Default** item.
. Open the **Variations** tab.
. Click on **New**. +
→ The **Create new variations** window will open.
. Enter the content.
. Select one or multiple attributes. +
→ The number of different **combinations** will be displayed in the bottom right corner.
. Click on **Create variations**. +
→ The variations will be created and displayed in the variation overview.

[TIP]
.Selecting attributes for variations
====
If you select attributes for the main variation, the selected attributes will be available for all additional variations of the item. If you create an item without selecting attributes for the main variation, then it will be possible to select all of the attributes that are available in the system when you create variations later. Once you have created a variation with attributes, it will only be possible to create additional variations of the item with these attributes or without any attributes.

If you delete all variations of an item where the main variation has no attributes, then it will be possible to select all of the attributes that are available in the system when creating new variations. Therefore, you only have to delete the variations of an item without deleting the item itself, in order to make new attributes available for this item. Once you have created variations for an item, attributes can no longer be deleted or added. To delete or add attributes, all variations with attributes must be deleted from the item.

=== Linking properties and texts

[WARNING]
.Variation properties and variation texts cannot be shown in the online store or on markets
====
At this point in time, you can create variation properties and variation texts and link them to variations. However, this data currently cannot be displayed in the online store or transferred to markets. These features will be available soon.
====

Properties are centrally managed in the *System » Settings » Properties* menu and can be linked to variations of *Default* items. Properties of the *Item* area are linked to variations in two different tabs of a variation:

* Variation properties of the types *Integer*, *Float*, *Selection*, *Date* and *File* are activated in the *Properties* tab of a variation.
* Variation properties of the types *Short text* and *Text* are linked in the *Texts* tab of the variation.

Learn how to create properties in the <<item/managing-items#3000, Managing properties>> chapter.

[NOTE]
.Inheritance of links and values
====
By default, inheritance of variation properties and variation texts is active. All combinations of properties and values that are saved for the main variation in the *Properties* and *Texts* tabs are inherited to those variations of the item for which inheritance is not deactivated. If you want to save individual properties for the variations of an item, deactivate the inheritance in the variation's tab and link properties.

|====
|Setting |Explanation

|**Storage location type**
|Select a storage location type based on the size of the variation.

|**Zone**
|Select a zone for the variation if your warehouse is divided into zones. A zone can contain several storage racks.

|**Reorder level**
|Enter a value. If the stock reaches or falls below this value, a reorder is created. If stock is reserved, then even positive stock can reach or fall below the reorder level. Variations below the reorder level can be filtered in the menu <<stock-management/managing-stocks#, Stock » Stocks>>. The minimum reorder quantity is displayed in the **RL Delta** column.

|**Stock turnover (in days)**
|The period in days that the stock of a specific variation will suffice until the next reorder. This value is relevant for calculating reorder proposals. A standard value that could be used for the stock turnover is 14 days. Once the variation has reached the reorder level, the value entered will be used for calculating the quantity of items that need to be reordered. In other words, the quantity suggested for reorder would be sufficient for the following 14 days. If no value is entered, the stock turnover (in days) is not taken into account for calculating the reorder date.

|**Maximum stock**
|Enter the maximum stock for the warehouse if you want to limit the stock.

|**Stock buffer**
|Enter a value for the stock buffer. The stock for particular markets will then be reduced by this value. +
__**Example**__: You have 50 variations in stock and you want a stock buffer of **10** so that the variation cannot be sold out completely via this market. A stock value of **40** is transferred to the market. +
Values entered are valid for the markets <<omni-channel/multi-channel/neckermann-at#, Neckermann.at>>, <<omni-channel/multi-channel/otto#, OTTO>>, <<omni-channel/multi-channel/rakuten#, Rakuten>>, <<omni-channel/multi-channel/plus-gartenxxl#, Plus.de>>. The buffer entered here takes priority over the buffer values entered for the particular market.

|**Suggested storage location**
|Select the storage location for the warehouse or select **Default storage location**. The storage location is suggested automatically when reordering. Select **Default storage location** if no storage location should be assigned.

|**Labels**
|Click on **Labels** to generate labels for the warehouse based on a template. For further information, refer to the <<item/managing-items#760, Setting up labels>> chapter.

== Turning a variation into the main variation

You can turn a different variation into the main variation. The old main variation becomes a child of the new main variation. Proceed as described below to set a new main variation.

[NOTE]
.Inheritance of values when setting a new main variation
====
If you set a new main variation, the values of this new main variation that can be inherited are compared to the values of the other variations of the item. All values remain unchanged. The following inheritance logic applies:

* For values that are identical to the values of the new main variation, inheritance is activated automatically.
* Values that are not identical to those of the new main variation are saved with the variation, i.e. inheritance is not activated.

Open the variations and deactivate inheritance if this behaviour does not meet your needs.
====

[.instruction]
Turning another variation into the main variation:

. Go to **Item » Edit item**.
. Open the **Default** item.
. Open the **Variations** tab.
. Open the variation you want to turn into the new main variation.
. In the variation's toolbar, click on **Make main variation**.
. Confirm your decision. +

=== Setting up the search index

A search index is needed in order for items to be found more easily during an item search in the plentymarkets back end and in the online store. The search index will be set up automatically when new items are created. The search index will be updated the night after you imported the items and will be available the next day. In the **System » Item » Search index** menu, you can start updating the search index manually. In the **Item catalogue** tab, you can see how many items are included in the search index. In the **Item properties** tab, you can see how many items with properties are included in the search index. <<table-search-index-overview>> provides information on the **Search index** menu.

|Execute to set up the search index manually. A maximum of 3000 items can be indexed per update (automatic or manual). You can carry out multiple cycles manually one after the other. Only one cycle is carried out overnight. The automatic update needs more than one night to deal with quantities of items that are larger than 3000. If you want to index the items more quickly, carry out multiple cycles manually.
|====

With the default index, you define parameters that are indexed in the search index and taken into account when performing an item search.

[.instruction]
Setting up the default index:

. Go to **System » Item » Search index » Tab: Item catalogue » Tab: Default index**.
. Activate the parameters that are taken into account when performing an item search.
. **Save** the settings.

In addition to the default index, you use the extended index to activate parameters that are taken into account when performing an item search with the **Browse description** option in the search area of the **Item » Edit item** menu. Set up the extended index in the same way.

[IMPORTANT]
.Avoid changing the search index
====
Try to avoid changing the search index. The search index must be built again after changes were made.

== Copying items and variations

In this chapter, you will learn how to copy items and variations. When copying an item, a copy of the item and all its variations is created. The following information is copied:

* Item data which is entered in the **Global** tab
* Item texts
* Free text fields
* Properties
* Images
* Cross-selling settings
* Sales prices including saved values
* Barcodes including saved values
* Item bundles

The following information is not copied:

* Listings
* Media files

* Dimensions
* Costs

New variation numbers for the main variation and all additional variations of the copied item will be assigned. Change the variation numbers in the <<item/managing-items#170, Settings>> tab of a variation. After copying, the copied <<item/managing-items#30, item>> can be edited. Proceed as follows to copy an item.

[.instruction]
Copying an item:

. Go to **Item » Edit item**.
. Open the item.
. Click on **Copy** in the item's toolbar. +
→ The **Copy** window will open.
. Click on **Copy**. +
→ The item will be copied. +
→ The copy will open in a new tab.

Copy an item variation to offer this variation with different contents. All variation data will be copied. Main variations cannot be copied.

[.instruction]

====
Check the <<item/managing-items#240, sales prices>> and <<item/managing-items#250, barcodes>> after copying and change these values if needed.
====

[#920]
== Setting up item bundles

An item bundle consists of multiple products. The bundle price of an item bundle may be lower than the sum of the individual prices. Go to **Item » Edit item** and use the **Bundle** filter to search for bundles.

[#930]
=== Creating item bundles

In the **Bundle** tab of a **Default** item, you create an item bundle which consists of multiple components, the basic items. If you add further variations to the opened item, you create a bundle. The bundle's components are displayed in the **Bundle components** tab where they can be edited or deleted.

[.instruction]
Creating an item bundle:

. Go to **Item » Edit item**.
. Click on **New**. +
→ The **New item** tab will open.
. Select the type **Default**.
. Enter a name.
. Enter the content.
. Select a category.
. Carry out additional settings as desired. Pay attention to the information given in <<table-creating-default-items>>.
. **Save** the settings. +
→ The item will be created and a new tab will open.
. Open the variation.
. Open the **Bundle » Add variation** tab.
. Place check marks next to the variations you want to add as bundle components.
. Click on **Add variation**. +
→ The components will be added to the bundle and displayed in the **Bundle components** tab.

Then link a sales price with the bundle item and enter a price. Learn how to link sales prices in the <<item/managing-items#240, Linking sales prices>> chapter. When processing the order, only the bundle price and the bundle components are shown. No individual prices are shown.

[NOTE]
.Using an existing item as the bundle item
====
Instead of creating a new bundle item, you can also use an existing item and add bundle components to this item. Note that the bundle item to which bundle components are added must not have stock.
====

[#933]
=== Editing or deleting bundle components

In the **Bundle components** tab, you can change the quantity of the bundle's variations, view the variations' net stock and delete bundle components that are no longer required.

[.instruction]
Deleting a bundle component:

. Go to **Item » Edit item**.
. Select **Yes** for the **Bundle** filter.
. Click on **Search**. +
→ All bundle items found will be displayed in the overview.
. Open the bundle item.
. Open the variation.
. Open the **Bundle » Bundle components** tab.
. Place check marks next to the bundle components you want to delete.
. Click on **Delete bundle components**. +
→ The bundle components will be deleted and no longer available in the item bundle.

[#935]
=== Creating multiple bundles in one item

Item variations also can be bundles with multiple components. In this way, you can design very complex item bundles that meet your individual needs.

[.subhead]
Example of bundle variations
Let's assume that you want to sell a bundle consisting of a hand towel and a larger bath towel. You also want to offer this bundle in different colours. To do so, the following steps are necessary:

* <<item/managing-items#400, Create an attribute>> with the colours you want to offer, e.g. red and blue.
* <<item/managing-items#20, Create an item>> that will serve as the bundle item, e.g. towel bundle.
* <<item/managing-items#160, Create variations>> of the bundle item and link the attribute values.
* Create items for the bundle components, e.g. hand towel and bath towel.
* Create variations of the bundle components, e.g. red hand towel, blue hand towel etc.
* Add the <<item/managing-items#930, bundle components>> to the variations of the item bundle.

In doing so, you can sell the item **towel bundle** in your online store and offer the bundle colours **red** and **blue**.

[#940]
=== Setting the stock of item bundles

The stock of a bundle depends on the bundle component with the lowest stock. The stock of this bundle component is displayed in the **Net stock** column of the item overview in the **Item » Edit item** menu. The bundle item itself must not have stock. In the **Stock** tab of a bundle component, you manage the stock, book incoming items, make stock corrections and view supplies as well as item movements. For further information, refer to the <<stock-management#, Stock>> page of the manual.

[#2080]
== Creating a Set item

[WARNING]
.Set items can not be rendered in the online store
====
You can create **Set** items. However, currently they can not be rendered in the online store. As such, the option **Active** can not be selected for **Set** items.
====

An item set consists of several items. When you offer **Set** items, your customers can choose one of the variations of the items to make an individual set. In contrast to item bundles, when you offer sets, customers can select one of several variations for each product added to the Set item. Go to **Item » Edit item** and use the **Type** filter to search for sets.

[#2000]
=== Preparing the set components

First, create a <<item/managing-items#880, sales price>> of the type **Set price**. Link this sales price to the variations of those **Default** items that you want to add to a set. Save a price for this sales price.

[#2010]
=== Creating a **Set** item

Just like when you create **Default** items, a main variation is always created when a new Set item is created. This main variation is linked permanently to the **Set** item and can only be created or deleted together with the item. However, unlike the main variations of **Default** items, the main variation of **Set** items is completely virtual. As such, the main variation of a set is not equivalent to a physical product. The main variations of **Set** items only serves as a data container. This container allows you to add set components and manage the settings for the set that is created from the sum of the individual components.

[.instruction]
Creating a Set item:

. Go to **Item » Edit item**.
. Click on **New**. +
→ The **New item** tab will open.
. Select the type **Set**.
. Carry out the additional settings. Note <<table-creating-set-items>>.
. **Save** the settings. +
→ The **Set** item is created and the main variation opens in a new tab.

[TIP]
.Displaying new **Set** items in the item overview
====
The new **Set** item is still inactive. In order to display recently created items in the item overview in the **Item » Edit item** menu, select the **ALL** option for the **Active** filter in the search area. Then click on **Search**. Learn how to activate items and variations for the online store in the <<item/managing-items#180, Setting the availability>> chapter.

[#1030]
=== Positioning the top items

You can also display top items in the online store sorted by their position numbers. For this option, use the <<omni-channel/online-store/setting-up-clients/cms-syntax#web-design-itemview-container-itemviewitemsbypositionlist, ItemViewItemsByPositionList>> template. Assign the position numbers either manually or automatically. To enter positions manually, select **No** for the setting **Automatically sort by monthly sales** in the **System » Client » Select client » Item layouts » Basic settings** menu. If you select **Yes**, the positions will be assigned automatically. Any positions entered manually will be overwritten if this setting is selected. The automatic assignment is based on your monthly sales and thus will display your true top sellers.

[#1040]
==== Positioning top items manually

You can individually define your top items by assigning them position numbers manually. The template <<omni-channel/online-store/setting-up-clients/cms-syntax#web-design-itemview-container-itemviewitemsbypositionlist, ItemViewItemsByPositionList>> displays items according to their position. The items are displayed in descending order. This template can be used to display the manually sorted top items in your online store. The template is found in the menu **CMS » Web design » Folder: Layout » Folder: ItemView » Template: ItemViewItemsByPositionList**.

[.instruction]
Positioning top items manually:

. Go to **Item » Edit item**.
. Open the item.
. Open the variation.
. Click on the **Settings** tab.
. Enter the **Position** in the **Basic settings** area. +
→ Items will be sorted and displayed in descending order. Therefore, assign the highest position numbers to top items.
. **Save** the settings.

[#1050]
==== Positioning top items automatically

Once a day, plentymarkets calculates how often item variations have been sold. These sales determine the position. The most frequently sold top item will be given the highest position number. Carry out the following settings if you want the position to be entered automatically into the **Position** option within the item variation's **Settings** tab.

[.instruction]
Positioning top items automatically:

. Go to **System » Client » Select client » Item layouts » Basic settings**.
. Select **Yes** for the setting **Automatically sort by monthly sales**.
. **Save** the settings.

The template <<omni-channel/online-store/setting-up-clients/cms-syntax#web-design-itemview-container-itemviewitemsbypositionlist, ItemViewItemsByPositionList>> displays items according to their position. The items are displayed in descending order. This template can be used to display the automatically calculated top items in your online store.

For further information about setting up the different templates in the layout, refer to the <<omni-channel/online-store/setting-up-clients/item-sorting#, Item sorting>> page of the manual.

== Managing item templates

Item templates can be used to create differing description texts for various categories of items in the online store.

Let's assume you sell fashion and accessories. You would like a note to appear in the detailed view of each fashion item, reminding the customer to select a colour. However, you do not want this note to be shown for accessories. To put this into practice without having to add the note to the description of each **fashion** item individually, create a new category of the type **Content** that contains the information you want to display. The content consists of the template variable **$Description** as well as your note. The template variable **$Description** is important, because without it only the additional text will be displayed. Then you link the items with the new category. In the online store, the item description will then be displayed together with the additional text of the item template.

=== Creating item templates

In order to attach the additional text to item descriptions, proceed as follows.

. Select the type **Content**.
. **Save** the settings.
. Click on the **Description 1** tab and enter the template variable **$Description** and the **additional text** (image 1).
. **Save** the settings.

Instead of the template variable **$Description**, the actual item description will be displayed in the **description** area in the online store. This was entered into the **Item text** field in the item's **Texts** tab. The additional text entered into the item template will be attached to this description.

[IMPORTANT]
