:description: Learn how to create and manage items in plentymarkets.
:position: 100

Create items and item variations for your products in plentymarkets. Items can be sold in your <<omni-channel/online-store/setting-up-clients#, online-store>> and on the many <<omni-channel/multi-channel#, markets>> integrated with plentymarkets.

First, you will learn how to update product information for your items. Create <<item/managing-items#390, attributes>>, <<item/managing-items#480, properties>>, <<item/managing-items#560, manufacturers>> and <<item/managing-items#630, barcodes>>. Link this information with your items. Furthermore, you find information and tips for structuring <<item/managing-items#870, sales prices>> for your items and variations. <<item/managing-items#910, Price calculations>> will also be explained. Price calculations allow you to customise and graduate prices for different customer classes as well as referrers.

Next, become familiar with the plentymarkets 7 item architecture. A <<item/managing-items#20, default item>> consists of global settings and data of the main variation as well as <<item/managing-items#160, additional variations>>. Global settings apply to all variations of the **Default** item. Information saved with the main variation is passed on to additional variations. However, you can change the settings of every variation individually.

== Managing attributes

Certain items, such as shoes and T-shirts, are typically available in different sizes and colours. Some items are available in different quantities, e.g. 50 ml or 250 ml. In plentymarkets, these characteristics of an item are called attributes. Attributes allow you to create variations of an item.

[#400]
=== Creating attributes

Create attributes as well as attribute values and link this information with your items and variations.

[.instruction]
Creating a new attribute:

. Go to **System » Item » Attributes**.
. Click on **New attribute**.

[#480]
== Managing properties

Properties are characteristics of an item. Unlike attributes, properties are passive characteristics. As such, properties are not required to create variations. Besides, properties cannot be selected in the detailed view of an item in the online store. With properties, you can highlight features of items, e.g. technical details such as Bluetooth or Wi-Fi, etc. Properties are passive characteristics which are not connected to stock. By using order properties, you can provide services for an additional charge or integrate a text field for a customer's additional requests. When setting up the property search, you can use properties to provide your customers with a more specific search. Properties also allow you to link your items with the properties for variations of a market.

[#490]
=== Creating property groups

Create property groups to sort your properties into groups. By using property groups, you keep track of large numbers of properties. When linking items with properties, the properties will be displayed in the assigned property groups.

[.instruction]
Creating a new property group:

. Go to **System » Item » Properties**.
. Click on the **New property group** tab.
. Carry out the settings as desired. Pay attention to the information given in <<table-create-property-groups>>.

[#3000]
== Managing variation properties

Properties are frequently occurring information that you can use in different areas of plentymarkets. Properties are centrally managed in the *System » Settings » Properties » Configuration* menu and can be used in the following areas of plentymarkets:

* Contacts
* Items

Properties of the *Item* area are linked to variations. As such, these properties are different from the old properties, which are linked at the item level. You can create up to 500 variation properties and link them to variations.

In contrast to attributes, properties are passive. As such, properties cannot be used to create variations. With properties, you can highlight recurring features of variations, e.g. technical details such as Bluetooth or Wi-Fi. Properties are not linked to stock and also cannot be selected in the detailed view of an item in the online store.

By using properties, you can provide services for an additional charge or integrate a text field for a customer's additional requests. Properties also allow you to link your items with the properties for variations of a market. Use the property search to find variations that are linked to a specific property.

[IMPORTANT]
.Important notes about the variation properties
====
However, you can create properties in the *System » Settings » Properties » Configuration* menu and also add values for the properties. You can also link these properties to variations in the *Item » Edit item » Open item » Open variation » Tab: Properties* menu. However, at this point in time you can only view the variation properties in the plentymarkets back end. The variation properties cannot be viewed in the online store or transferred to markets. These features will be available soon.

.Barcode types
[cols="1,2"]
|====
|Setting |Explanation

|*GTIN 8*; +
*GTIN 13*; +
*GTIN 14*; +
*GTIN 128*
|The Global Trade Item Number (formerly European Article Number, EAN) is a product barcode for items. The GTIN consists of 8, 13, 14 or a maximum of 128 characters and is centrally administered and issued for manufacturers upon request.

|**ISBN**
|The International Standard Book Number is a unique number of 10 or 13 characters to register books and other independent, discontinuous publications like multimedia products and software.

|**QR**
|Quick Response Code. The code contains data such as the version, the data format and other information.

|**CODE 128**
|Alphanumeric barcode. The Code128 consists of start character, encoded data, check character and stop character.

|**UPC**
|The Universal Product Code is a product barcode for items. The UPC is a 12-digit number. By adding a leading **0**, this barcode can be used as a 13-digit GTIN.
|====

[#645]
=== Finding duplicate barcodes

It is possible to save identical barcode codes for more than one variation. If you do not want to work with duplicate codes, you can search for and correct any duplicate codes in the system. The search is designed to locate identical codes of the same barcode type that are saved for different variations.

[.instruction]
Finding duplicate barcodes:

. Go to **System » Item » Barcode**.
. Click on **Duplicate barcodes**. +
→ The **Duplicate barcodes** tab opens.
. Klick on **Search** to list all duplicate barcodes. +
**__Tip:__** Enter a **Variation ID** or a **Barcode** code to limit the search results. +
→ The duplicate codes are listed.
. Click on the variation you want to edit. +
→ The variation opens.
. Edit the variation's code.
. **Save** the variation settings.

[#650]
=== Setting up GTIN numbering

Many sellers do not have GTIN s (barcodes) for their items because they directly import their items and the manufacturer does not assign a GTIN. In such cases, you can purchase GTINs from GS1 Germany and use these GTINs e.g. on the markets <<omni-channel/multi-channel/amazon#, Amazon>> or <<omni-channel/multi-channel/real-de#, real.de>>. 13-digit GTINs (formerly EAN) consist of the basic group, the item reference and the check digit. The basic group has 7 to 9 digits and contains the GS1 prefix with the country code, e.g. 500 to 509 for the UK, as well as the company number. The item reference of the manufacturer consists of 3 to 5 digits (depending on the basic group's length). The check digit is the last digit.

[.instruction]
Setting up GTIN numbering:

. Go to **System » Item » GTIN**.
. Enter the starting value. +
→ For 13 digit GTINs this must be a 12 digit value. The check digit is entered automatically.
. Enter the number of GTINs.
. **Save** the settings.

Assign the GTINs generated with GTIN numbering to your items in the <<item/managing-items#250, Barcodes>> area in the **Item » Edit item » Open item » Open variation » Tab: Settings** menu. Select the correct GTIN type and click on **Generate GTIN** in the **Code** column of this type. The next available GTIN is inserted into the **Code** field automatically. To generate GTINs for several variations at the same time, use the <<item/managing-items#330, Variation group function>> or <<item/managing-items#330, Variation batch processing>>.

[#660]
== Managing item images

Item images are saved on S3 and delivered using CloudFront, a CDN service by AWS. CDN is short for Content Delivery Network. CDN allows completely scalable delivery of item images. CDN makes it possible to only save the original image. A specified dimension of the original image is created when the image is displayed on screen. This dimension is then saved in the CloudFront CDN cache.

=== Saving own domain for image URLs

Item images are assigned the URL of the default CDN domain by default. This means that the URLs of item images contain the domain name "plentymarkets.com”. However, instead of the default CDN domain, you can also set up the domain of the client and save a custom subdomain for item images. <<table-domain-image-URLs>> shows the differences between the default CDN domain and an individual CDN domain. You can set up an own CDN domain for domains hosted by plentymarkets and for domains hosted by an external provider. However, note the following limitations:

* You can only save individual subdomains for the main domain.
* You can only save one subdomain for each client.

=== Uploading item images via FTP server

Every plentymarkets system has its own <<basics/data-exchange/ftp-access#, FTP server>>. This FTP server contains the folder *upload_article_image_XXXX* (XXXX = plentyID) to which you can upload item images. The folder is checked for changes every 60 minutes. New, correctly named images are assigned to the correct item automatically. To upload files, you need an FTP program and your FTP login details.

[#image-names]
==== Naming of item image files for FTP import

Go to *System » Item » Images » Settings* and use the option *Image names of the FTP import* to choose whether the file names of the imported item images include the item ID or the variation No. Depending on this setting, you either name the files with the item ID or the variation number.

[NOTE]

====
The following characters are supported for image file names:

* Letters (a-z, A-Z) excluding umlauts
* Numbers (0-9)
* Underscores (_)
* Hyphens (-)

Spaces and special characters are not permitted. When you upload images, spaces and special characters are replaced by hyphens (-).
====

If you want to upload several images for one item, number the files by adding suffixes. You have to separate the image number from the item ID or variation No. with three hyphens, i.e. *---*. You can upload up to 100 images per item by numbering them from 0 to 99.

== Creating variations

A main variation is always created when a new **Default** item is created. The main variation is linked permanently to the **Default** item. It cannot be deleted. Information saved for the main variation, such as sales prices and availability, is passed on to item variations. However, you can change the settings of every variation individually. First, learn how to create variations.

[.instruction]
Creating variations:

. Go to **Item » Edit item**.
. Open the **Default** item.
. Open the **Variations** tab.
. Click on **New**. +
→ The **Create new variations** window opens.
. Enter the content.
. Select one or multiple attributes. +
→ The number of **combinations** is displayed in the bottom right corner. This number of variations will be created.
. Click on **Create variations**. +
→ The variations is created and displayed in the variation overview.

[TIP]
.Selecting attributes for variations
====
If you select attributes for the main variation, the selected attributes will be available for all additional variations of the item. If you create an item without selecting attributes for the main variation, then it will be possible to select all of the attributes that are available in the system when you create variations later. Once you have created a variation with attributes, it will only be possible to create additional variations of the item with these attributes or without any attributes.

If you delete all variations of an item where the main variation has no attributes, then it will be possible to select all of the attributes that are available in the system when creating new variations. Therefore, you only have to delete the variations of an item without deleting the item itself, in order to make new attributes available for this item. Once you have created variations for an item, attributes can no longer be deleted or added. To delete or add attributes, all variations with attributes must be deleted from the item.

|Setting |Explanation

|**Active**
|Activate the variation to offer the variation in the online store or, in the case of **Default** items, on markets. Variations will only be displayed in the online store when the variations are active. When searching for items using the default settings, inactive variations will not be shown. Select **No** in the **Active** filter to search for inactive variations.

|**Availability**
|Select the availability. 10 availability levels are available. +
*_Note:_* The availability is a static setting. That means that the availability level selected does not change irrespective of actual stock levels. The setting is relevant only if stock availability is not set automatically.

|*Show in online store:* +
*Available if net stock is positive*; +
*Not available if net stock is 0 or negative*
|Activate to make the variation available if the net stock is positive and unavailable if the net stock is 0 or negative. Both functions complement each other and work in combination with the **To net stock** option under **Limitation**. plentymarkets automatically controls the item's availability in the online store. Variations do not have to be made invisible if no net stock is available.

|*Client:* +
*Automatically visible if net stock is positive*; +
*Automatically invisible if net stock is 0 or negative*
|Activate to automatically make the variation visible in the online store if the net stock is positive and invisible if the net stock is 0 or negative. Both functions complement each other and are only applied if the *Limitation* option is set to *To net stock*. When the options are activated and no net stock is available for the variation, the variation is not visible in the online store. Even the direct URL to the variation does not work.

|*Item list* +
(automation currently only works for Calisto, implementation in Ceres to follow)
|*Always invisible* (previously *Invisible: in item list*) = Activate to make the variations invisible in the item list of the online store. When the option is activated, the variation can only be opened using the direct URL to the variation. The variation is not shown in the categories, search results or item lists, i.e. store specials, cross-selling and last seen items.
*Automatically visible if net stock is positive*; +
*Invisible automatically if net stock is 0 or negative* = Activate to automatically make the variation visible in the item list if the net stock is positive and invisible if the net stock is 0 or negative. Both functions complement each other and are only applied if the *Limitation* option is set to *To net stock*. When the options are activated and no net stock is available for the variation, the variation can only be opened using the direct URL to the variation. The variation is not shown in the categories, search results or item lists, i.e. store specials, cross-selling and last seen items. +
*_Note:_* The options *Client: Automatically visible if net stock is positive* or *Client: Invisible automatically if net stock is 0 or negative* takes priority. When those options are activated and no net stock is available for the variation, the variation is also not visible in the online store. Even the direct URL to the variation does not work. As such, we recommend that you do not combine these settings and manage the visibility using either the store visibility or the item list visibility.

|**In supply**
|Displays the estimated delivery date of ordered variations. For further information about reorders refer to <<stock-management/managing-reorders#, Managing reorders>>.

== Turning a variation into the main variation

You can turn a different variation into the main variation. The old main variation becomes a child of the new main variation. Proceed as described below to set a new main variation.

[NOTE]
.Inheritance of values when setting a new main variation
====
If you set a new main variation, the values of this new main variation that can be inherited are compared to the values of the other variations of the item. All values remain unchanged. The following inheritance logic applies:

* For values that are identical to the values of the new main variation, inheritance is activated automatically.
* Values that are not identical to those of the new main variation are saved with the variation, i.e. inheritance is not activated.

Open the variations and deactivate inheritance if this behaviour does not meet your needs.
====

[.instruction]
Turning another variation into the main variation:

. Go to **Item » Edit item**.
. Open the **Default** item.
. Open the **Variations** tab.
. Open the variation you want to turn into the new main variation.
. In the variation's toolbar, click on **Make main variation**.
. Confirm your decision. +
→ The variation becomes the **Default** item's main variation.

=== Setting up the back end item search

Go to *System » Item » Search » Back end » Search index* to set up searching for items in the *Item » Editing items*. To do so, you define those item parameters to be added to the search index. These parameters will then be searched during an item search in the back end.

The search index is set up automatically when a new item are created. The search index is updated the night after you imported the items. A maximum of 3000 items are added to the search index at a time. As such, if more than 3000 items are saved in the system, it can take several nights to update the search index.

In the *Item catalogue* tab, you can see how many items are included in the search index. In the **Item properties** tab, you can see how many items with properties are included in the search index.

In the *System » Item » Search » Back end » Search index* menu, you can start updating the search index manually.

== Copying items and variations

In this chapter, you will learn how to copy items and variations. When copying an item, a copy of the item and all its variations is created. The following information is copied:

* Item data which is entered in the **Global** tab
* Item texts
* Free text fields
* Properties
* Images
* Cross-selling settings
* Sales prices including saved values
* Barcodes including saved values
* Item bundles

The following information is not copied:

* Listings
* Media files
* Availability of the main variation
* Dimensions
* Costs

New variation numbers for the main variation and all additional variations of the copied item will be assigned. Change the variation numbers in the <<item/managing-items#170, Settings>> tab of a variation. After copying, the copied <<item/managing-items#30, item>> can be edited. Proceed as follows to copy an item.

[.instruction]
Copying an item:

. Go to **Item » Edit item**.
. Open the item.
. Click on **Copy** in the item's toolbar. +
→ The **Copy** window opens.
. Click on **Copy**. +

[#2080]
For further information about creating item bundles and sets, refer to the <<item/managing-multipacks-bundles-sets#, Managing multipacks, item bundles and sets>> page of the manual.

[#950]
== Setting up cross-selling

With the cross-selling function, you have the possibility of offering additional items from your product range along with an item in your online store. The additional items should be necessary extensions or reasonable supplements for your customer's current selection. Just a few examples:

* The right batteries are needed for a flashlight.
* A digital camera only makes sense in combination with a memory card that has sufficient capacity.
* A customer who buys a premium tennis racket is likely to invest in a nice bag to store the racket in.

Replacement parts can also be offered as cross-selling items. If such connections also exist for your items, then you can use the **cross-selling** option to set up associations between them and benefit from additional sales.

[TIP]
.YOOCHOOSE
====
The external service provider <<omni-channel/online-store/setting-up-clients/extras/yoochoose#, YOOCHOOSE>> offers an alternative to plentymarkets cross-selling.
====

The following requirements have to be met in order for direct cross-selling items to be displayed in your online store:

* The item category of the cross-selling item has to be activated.
* The items have to be visible in the store.

Items can be grouped in item lists and highlighted on the homepage of the online store and in the single item view.
Find out how to create **Cross-selling** item lists on the <<omni-channel/online-store/setting-up-ceres#110, Setting up item lists>> page of the manual.

== Setting up give-aways

Use give-aways to generate more revenue in your online store by motivating your customers to buy more items and more frequently. The basic idea is simple: You offer customers a variation as a give-away when they reach a defined value of items per order. Instead of adding these give-aways to each order manually, you can use an <<basics/automation/event-procedures#, event procedure>> to automate this process.

You can also add promotional items that you do not want to sell in the online store. To do so, set the variation to *invisible* and link it to an invisible category, i.e. a category that is not activated for the online store.

[TIP]
.Tip: Bonus item scale
====
Use more than one event procedure to offer a bonus item scale. This allows you to offer different variations depending on the value of items customers buy. In the first event procedure, e.g. set the item value filter to *&gt;= 100.00 GBP* and *&lt; 200.00 GBP*. In the second event procedure, set an item value filter of *&gt;= 200 GBP* and select a different, more attractive variation.

== Callisto: Managing item templates

Item templates can be used to create differing description texts for various categories of items in the online store.

Let's assume you sell fashion and accessories. You would like a note to appear in the detailed view of each fashion item, reminding the customer to select a colour. However, you do not want this note to be shown for accessories. To put this into practice without having to add the note to the description of each **fashion** item individually, create a new category of the type **Content** that contains the information you want to display. The content consists of the template variable **$Description** as well as your note. The template variable **$Description** is important, because without it only the additional text will be displayed. Then you link the items with the new category. In the online store, the item description will then be displayed together with the additional text of the item template.
