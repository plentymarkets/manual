With plentymarkets, you can sell personalised items in your plentyShop.
For example, your customers could:

* <<item/use-cases/personalised-items#100, upload an image>> that should be printed on a t-shirt.
* <<item/use-cases/personalised-items#100, enter a personal text>> that should be engraved on a dog tag.
* <<item/use-cases/personalised-items#200, choose options>>, e.g. gold or diamond trim for a wedding ring.
* <<item/use-cases/personalised-items#200, choose additional services>>, e.g. an assembly service for kitchen cabinets.

In plentymarkets, personalised items are sold with the help of so-called _order characteristics_.
As the name suggests, order characteristics are a special type of <<item/settings/properties#, characteristic>>. Customers can choose them in the plentyShop and order them along with the product.

[TIP]
.Customers should only be able to personalise specific variations, rather than the entire item. Can I do that?
====
Currently, it’s only possible to make entire items customisable, rather than specific variations.
But our developers are working hard on a solution: _order properties_.
Once they are released, it will be possible to configure the settings <<item/introduction/structure#, for individual variations>>.

== Personal images or texts

Imagine you sell t-shirts. Your customers should be able to upload their own images and have them printed on t-shirts.

Or maybe your customers should be able to enter personal texts and have them engraved e.g. on dog tags.
The procedure is nearly identical in both examples.
In both cases, this is what you’ll do:

* Create an order characteristic.
* Link the order characteristic with the appropriate items.
* Check the result in your plentyShop.

[#130]
=== Creating an order characteristic

First, create all of the necessary order characteristics.
For example, the ability to upload a custom image or enter a personal text.

[.instruction]
Creating a new order characteristic:

. Go to *Setup » Item » Characteristics*.
. Click on the *New characteristic* tab.
. Carry out the settings as follows. Expand the info box (icon:chevron-down[role="darkGrey"]) if you need additional information about one of the options.

* Use the options *Name (internal)* and *Webshop* to save a back end and front end name for the characteristic.
* Should customers be allowed to upload images? Then select *File* as the *Characteristic type*.
* Should customers be allowed to enter text? Then select *Text* as the *Characteristic type*.
* Enter a value if a *surcharge* is to be added for the characteristic.
* Where should the characteristic be displayed? Use the *Show* option to select all of the appropriate areas (icon:check-square[role="blue"]).
* Select the Order characteristic option (icon:check-square[role="blue"]).

. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

=== Linking an order characteristic to items

Next, link the order characteristic to all of the appropriate items.

[TIP]
.Item-specific surcharge
====
You might have already saved a surcharge <<item/use-cases/personalised-items#130, while creating the characteristic>>.
But what should you do if not every item should be given the same surcharge?
Once you’ve linked the characteristic to an item, you can enter an item-specific surcharge, which overwrites the surcharge that was saved for the characteristic as a whole.

=== Checking the result

Compare both images and see how the settings are displayed in the plentyShop.

[#200]
== Options or services

Imagine you sell wedding rings. You want to let customers design the rings themselves.
Specifically, customers should be able to choose an optional gold or diamond trim for an additional fee.

Or perhaps you sell furniture and you want to offer customers an optional assembly service.
The procedure is identical in both examples:

* Create a characteristic group.
* Create the order characteristics and sort them into the group.
* Link the order characteristics with the appropriate items.
* Check the result in your plentyShop.

[#220]
=== Creating a characteristic group

You can use characteristic groups to sort the additional options and services that you offer under one heading.
Let’s stick with the example that you sell wedding rings and you want to let customers choose an optional gold or diamond trim.
You can create a characteristic group called “Trim” to clearly display these options.
Within this group, customers can choose the options “Gold trim” or “Diamond trim”.


[.instruction]
Creating a new characteristic group:

. Go to *Setup » Item » Characteristics*.
. Click on the *New characteristic group* tab.
. Carry out the settings as follows. Expand the info box (icon:chevron-down[role="darkGrey"]) if you need additional information about one of the options.

* Use the options *Name (internal)* and *Language* to save a back end and front end name for the characteristic group.
* Do you plan on offering the characteristics within this group for a *Surcharge*? If so, decide whether it should be a percentage or a fixed price.
* Should customers be able to choose one or multiple characteristics from the group? Make your decision with the option *Grouping of order characteristics*.

. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

* Choose the *Characteristic group* into which you want to sort this characteristic.
* Select *No* as the *Characteristic type*.
* Enter a value if a *surcharge* is to be added for the characteristic.
* Where should the characteristic be displayed? Use the *Show* option to select all of the appropriate areas (icon:check-square[role="blue"]).
* Select the Order characteristic option (icon:check-square[role="blue"]).
