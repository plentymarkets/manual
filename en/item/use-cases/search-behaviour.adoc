[.instruction]
Customising the item overview:

. Go to **Setup » Item » Settings**.
. For the option **Prioritised price in item overview**, select the sales price to be displayed in the **Sales price** column of the item overview. +

== Setting up the back end item search

Go to *Setup » Item » Search » Back end » Search index* to set up searching for items in the *Item » Editing items*. To do so, you define those item parameters to be added to the search index. These parameters will then be searched during an item search in the back end.

The search index is set up automatically when a new item are created. The search index is updated the night after you imported the items. A maximum of 3000 items are added to the search index at a time. As such, if more than 3000 items are saved in the system, it can take several nights to update the search index.

In the *Item catalogue* tab, you can see how many items are included in the search index. In the **Item characteristics** tab, you can see how many items with characteristics are included in the search index.

In the *Setup » Item » Search » Back end » Search index* menu, you can start updating the search index manually.
