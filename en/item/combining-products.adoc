[#1000]
== Setting up a multipack

For *Multipack* items, the main variation is the smallest sales unit of the product. All other variations of the item are combinations of this smallest sales unit. Stock is managed for the main variation only. All variations of the item have the same attributes. That means that customers cannot select between different colours or other characteristics of the product. In the online store, customers select the variation with the number of products they want to buy.


[#1100]
=== Creating a Multipack item

Just like when you create *Default* items, a main variation is always created when a new multipack item is created. This main variation is linked permanently to the *Multipack* item and can only be created or deleted at the same time as the item itself. This main variation itself is the smallest sales unit of the product.

[.instruction]
Creating a Multipack item:

. Go to *Item » Edit item*.
. Click on *New*. +
→ The *New item* tab opens.
. Select the type *Multipack*.
. Carry out the additional settings. Pay attention to the information given in <<table-combining-products>>.
. *Save* the settings. +
→ The *Multipack* item is created. +
→ The main variation opens in a new tab.

[TIP]
.Displaying new *Multipack* items in the item overview
====
The new *Multipack* item is not active. To display recently created items in the item overview in the *Item » Edit item* menu, select the *ALL* option for the *Active* filter in the search area. Then click on *Search*. Learn how to activate items and variations for the online store in the <<item/managing-items#180, Setting the availability>> chapter.

[#1300]
=== Editing Multipack items

Now that you have created the *Multipack* item, you can refine the settings for the multipack. These settings are identical to the settings for <<item/managing-items#30, Default items>>.

[#1400]
=== Creating a multipack variation

A main variation is always created when a new *Multipack* item is created. The main variation is linked to an item. The main variation cannot be deleted. This main variation is the smallest sales unit of the product. All other variations of the item are this smallest sales unit multiplied by x. The stock of all variations is managed in the main variation only. The *Stock* tab of all other variations of the item only shows the theoretical stock. When the stock level of the main variation changes, the stock for all other variations of the item is recalculated.

[.instruction]
Creating a multipack variation:

. Go to *Item » Edit item*.
. Open the *Multipack* item.
. Open the *Variations* tab.
. Click on *New*. +
→ The *Create new variations* window opens.
. As the content, enter a quantity for the main variation.
*_Tip:_* The variation’s units and the attributes cannot be changed.
. Click on *Create variation*. +
→ The variation is created. +
→ The variation is displayed in the variation overview.

The settings of the variations are edited in the same way as <<item/managin-items#170, Default variations>>. However, note the following limitations for multipack variations:

* Deactivate the inheritance function for the sales price and save a price.
* The information shown in the *Stock* tab cannot be edited. Stock is managed for the main variation only.

[#2000]
== Setting up an item bundle

An item bundle consists of multiple products. The bundle price of an item bundle may be lower than the sum of the individual prices. Go to *Item » Edit item* and use the *Bundle* filter to search for bundles.

[#2100]
=== Creating an item bundle

In the *Bundle* tab of a *Default* item, you create an item bundle which consists of multiple components, the basic items. If you add further variations to the opened item, you create a bundle. The bundle's components are displayed in the *Bundle components* tab where they can be edited or deleted.

[.instruction]
Creating an item bundle:

. Go to *Item » Edit item*.
. Click on *New*. +
→ The *New item* tab opens.
. Select the type *Default*.
. Enter a name.
. Enter the content.
. Select a category.
. Carry out additional settings as desired. Pay attention to the information given in <<table-create-default-items>>.
. *Save* the settings. +
→ The item is created. +
→ The main variation opens in a new tab.
. Open the variation.
. Open the *Bundle » Add variation* tab.
. Place check marks next to the variations you want to add as bundle components.
. Click on *Add variation*. +
→ The components are added to the item bundle and displayed in the *Bundle components* tab.

Then link a sales price with the item bundle and enter a price. Learn how to link sales prices in the <<item/managing-items#240, Linking sales prices>> chapter. When processing the order, only the bundle price and the bundle components are shown. No individual prices are shown.

[NOTE]
.Using an existing item as the bundle item
====
Instead of creating a new bundle item, you can also use an existing item and add bundle components to this item. Note that the bundle item to which bundle components are added must not have stock.
====

[#2200]
=== Editing or deleting bundle components

In the *Bundle components* tab, you can change the quantity of the item bundle's variations, view the variations' net stock and delete bundle components that are no longer required.

[.instruction]
Deleting a bundle component:

. Go to *Item » Edit item*.
. Select *Yes* for the *Bundle* filter.
. Click on *Search*. +
→ All bundle items found are displayed in the overview.
. Open the bundle item.
. Open the variation.
. Open the *Bundle » Bundle components* tab.
. Place check marks next to the bundle components you want to delete.
. Click on *Delete bundle components*. +
→ The bundle components are deleted and no longer available in the item bundle.

[#2300]
=== Creating multiple bundles in one item

Item variations also can be bundles with multiple components. In this way, you can design very complex item bundles that meet your individual needs.

[.subhead]
Example of bundle variations: Let us assume that you want to sell a bundle consisting of a hand towel and a larger bath towel. You also want to offer this bundle in different colours. To do so, the following steps are necessary:

* <<item/managing-items#400, Create an attribute>> with the colours you want to offer, e.g. red and blue.
* <<item/managing-items#20, Create an item>> that will serve as the bundle item, e.g. towel bundle.
* <<item/managing-items#160, Create variations>> of the bundle item and link the attribute values.
* Create items for the bundle components, e.g. hand towel and bath towel.
* Create variations of the bundle components, e.g. red hand towel, blue hand towel etc.
* Add the <<item/managing-items#930, bundle components>> to the variations of the item bundle.

In doing so, you can sell the item *towel bundle* in your online store and offer the bundle colours *red* and *blue*.

[#2400]
=== Setting the stock of item bundles

The stock of a bundle depends on the bundle component with the lowest stock. The stock of this bundle component is displayed in the *Net stock* column of the item overview in the *Item » Edit item* menu. The bundle item itself must not have stock. In the *Stock* tab of a bundle component, you manage the stock, book incoming items, make stock corrections and view supplies as well as item movements. For further information, refer to the <<stock-management#, Stock management>> page of the manual.


[#3000]
== Setting up a set (not sellable)

[#3100]
=== Creating a Set item

[WARNING]
.Set items can not be rendered in the online store
====
You can create *Set* items. However, currently set items can not be rendered in the online store. As such, you cannot select the option *Active* for *Set* items.
====

An item set consists of several items. When you offer *Set* items, your customers can choose one of the variations of the items to make an individual set. In contrast to item bundles, when you offer sets, customers can select one of several variations for each product added to the Set item. Go to *Item » Edit item* and use the *Type* filter to search for sets.

[#3200]
=== Preparing the set components

First, create a <<item/managing-items#880, sales price>> of the type *Set price*. Link this sales price to the variations of those *Default* items that you want to add to a set. Save a price for this sales price.

[#3300]
=== Creating a Set item

Just like when you create *Default* items, a main variation is always created when a new Set item is created. This main variation is linked permanently to the *Set* item and can only be created or deleted together with the item. However, unlike the main variations of *Default* items, the main variation of *Set* items is completely virtual. As such, the main variation of a set is not equivalent to a physical product. The main variations of *Set* items only serves as a data container. This container allows you to add set components and manage the settings for the set that is created from the sum of the individual components.

[.instruction]
Creating a Set item:

. Go to *Item » Edit item*.
. Click on *New*. +
→ The *New item* tab opens.
. Select the type *Set*.
. Carry out the additional settings. Pay attention to the information given in <<table-create-set-items>>.
. *Save* the settings. +
→ The *Set* item is created. +
→ The main variation opens in a new tab.

[TIP]
.Displaying new *Set* items in the item overview
====
The new *Set* item is still inactive. In order to display recently created items in the item overview in the *Item » Edit item* menu, select the *ALL* option for the *Active* filter in the search area. Then click on *Search*. Learn how to activate items and variations for the online store in the <<item/managing-items#180, Setting the availability>> chapter.
