Should variations that have this attribute be displayed individually or cumulatively in the online store? +
*Check mark* = Each variation will be displayed as an individual product in the online store.

*_Example:_* you sell a shoe with 2 attributes: colour and size. You want each shoe colour to look like an individual product in the online store, but not each size. In this case, you’ll check this option for the attribute “colour” and you you won’t check this option for the attribute “size”. +
When customers browse through the category in your store, they’ll see each colour variation as a separate product. If a customer clicks on a colour variation, then he will be taken to the item’s webpage. Here the customer will see a drop-down list, which he can use to select the appropriate shoe size.

*_Relationship to other settings:_* Check your settings for the <<online-store/setting-up-ceres#90, item view and category view in the Ceres plugin>>. The option *Show variations by type* can affect the option *Groupable in item lists* and vice versa.

*_Callisto users:_* If you use the old Callisto store, then available item variations will be displayed with the template <<online-store/online-store/cms-syntax#web-design-itemview-container-itemviewcategorieslist, ItemViewCategoriesList>>. The *$ItemViewCategoriesList_GroupByVariation* option is found in the settings of the Callisto template. Here you can select if you want to group by attributes or by variations.
