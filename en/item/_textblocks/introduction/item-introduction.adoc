Items are managed centrally in plentymarkets.
In other words, you’ll enter your product information into plentymarkets and then you’ll be able to sell your items on various <<markets#, markets>>, in your own <<online-store#, plentyShop>> and in your <<pos#, brick and mortar store>>.

If you need to make any changes in the future, e.g. edit an item's price or description, then you'll only have to modify this data centrally in plentymarkets.
The data can automatically be changed on all of your sales channels.

== Introducing the item structure

Are you new to plentymarkets? Before you start entering data, learn how items are structured! The introduction teaches you about the topic and answers your basic questions:

* What’s the difference between <<item/introduction/structure#, items and variations>>?
* How does <<item/introduction/inheritance#, inheritance>> work?
* Where do I find my <<item/introduction/search#100, items in the back end>>?
* Can I also see a few <<item/introduction/search#900, example items>>?

== Preparatory settings

//tag::preparatory-settings[]
Items are made up of lots of information, e.g. categories, prices and manufacturers.
But before you can sort an item into a specific category, the category first needs to exist in plentymarkets.
Before you can select an item’s manufacturer, the manufacturer data needs to exist in plentymarkets.
//end::preparatory-settings[]

Once you’ve saved such <<item/settings#, preparatory settings>> in plentymarkets, you’ll be able to apply them to all of the relevant items and variations.

Ready to start entering item data into plentymarkets? There are several different tools for doing so. The easiest way is to import item and variation data with an <<welcome/assistants#, assistant>>.

But it’s also possible to <<item/import-export-create/create/new-item#, manually create items in plentymarkets>> or to send product information back and forth between your own plentymarkets system and other external systems. For example, item data records can be:

* imported from existing <<markets/ebay/ebay-setup#11000, eBay listings>>.
* managed in CSV files and then <<item/import-export-create/import#, imported>>.
* imported from other systems with the <<data/rest-api#, REST-API>>.
* <<item/import-export-create/export#, exported>> out of your plentymarkets system.
