== Searching for items and variations

The menu *Item » Edit item* provides you with an overview of your items and variations. Use the filter options in the left column to search for specific items and variations. The <<item/introduction/search#600, search results>> will be displayed in an overview on the right.

[.instruction]
Searching for items:

. Go to *Item » Edit item*.
. Choose *filters* in the left column. Note <<table-filter-item-variations>>.
. Click on *Search* (icon:search[role="blue"]). +
→ The filtered items are displayed in the overview.

[TIP]
.Why aren’t my items found?
====
Do you see the <<item/introduction/search#active, Active>> filter in the left column? Use this filter to specify whether you only want to search for items and variations that are currently activated for an online store. This filter is set to *Yes* by default. Once you have many items and variations, this filter will help you edit your items quicker. However, it can also cause some confusion in the beginning because inactive items will not be found. Set the filter to *No* or *ALL* and search again.
