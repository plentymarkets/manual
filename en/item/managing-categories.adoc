There are different types of categories in plentymarkets. On the one hand, categories are what other systems may refer to as product groups or item categories. On the other hand, categories are also content pages for your On the other hand, categories are also content pages for your **CMS**. Both types of categories have many settings in common. For example, all types of categories are managed within a folder structure. This can be achieved by creating main categories and up to 5 levels of subcategories. All types of categories also typically include texts such as a description, short description, meta description and graphic elements. This is why all types of categories are managed together in plentymarkets.

////

The categories in plentymarkets can be categorised by their type. The types **Item**, **Content** and **Container** are available. By managing all types of categories together, each type has access to a few additional settings that would otherwise only be applicable to one of them. In some cases, these settings are also useful for the other types. For example, you can use a template variable to insert a short description for the type **Content**. You can use tags for the type **Item**.

== Preparation

=== Setting the category levels

First decide how many category levels should be displayed in the online store. Carry out these settings for each client. For example, if you select 4 levels, no categories can be created on the 5th level. This setting applies to the complete category tree, i.e. to all category types.

[.instruction]
Setting the category levels:

. Go to **System » Client » Select client » Categories » Basic settings**.
. Select the maximum number of levels in the category navigation.
. **Save** the setting.

=== Planning the structure of item categories

Set up a logical category structure before you begin creating categories. Before you start creating item categories, consider the products of your portfolio and divide these products into possible groups of categories and subcategories. Table 2 shows two simplified examples of different item structures.

== Creating multilingual category pages

If you want to make your online store available in several different languages, then you will also need to create categories in these languages. This chapter explains how to create multilingual categories of the type **Content**, the type **Item** and the type **Container**. Of course, this is assuming that you have already created categories in the online store's default language. For further information about the requirements of a multilingual online store, refer to the **<<omni-channel/online-store/setting-up-clients/multilingual-online-store#,Multilingualism>>** page of the manual.

There are two ways to create multilingual categories. You can choose between a multilingual or a monolingual editor. Use the monolingual editor to edit one language version after another. Use the multilingual editor to edit two languages at a time. Both procedures are described below.

=== Creating multilingual categories in the monolingual editor

Proceed as described below to create a language version of an existing category.

[IMPORTANT]
.Visibility of categories in the Item » Categories menu
====
In order for a category to be displayed within the directory tree in the **Item » Categories** menu, you must have already created this category in the system's default language. In other words, you must have at least entered a page name in the default language.

. Enter the **Name**, **URL name** and **Meta title**.
. Enter the foreign-language text and content into the **Description 1** text field.

→ The category is saved in the selected language.

[TIP]

====
You also can open new languages in the bilingual editor, i.e. languages for which no content has been saved yet. You do not necessarily have to open the default language.
====

== Activating a category

== Managing categories

=== Filtering categories

Categories can be filtered by client, language and type. The filters are located above the directory tree. The font indicates if a category is available in the selected combination. Categories that are displayed in normal font are available in the selected combination. Categories displayed in italic font are not available in the selected filter combination of client, language and type.

=== Searching for a category

The search function helps you find categories quickly. Enter the name of the category into the text field. Search results will appear while you are entering the name.

=== Copy category

The **Copy category** function allows you to create the same subcategory in several different parent categories. For example, this is useful if you want to have categories for women's, men's and children's clothing, and all three categories should include trousers as a subcategory.

. If necessary, change the category's position to sort it correctly.

=== Move category

Categories are displayed in the selected structure under **Item » Categories**. The category structure and category names form the basis for the navigation menu displayed in the online store. On the one hand, the structure is determined by the main and subcategories and by the relationship of the categories one another. These are the so-called levels. On the other hand, the structure is determined by the position numbers. Use the category positions to specify the order within a category level. Use the **Move category** function to move a category to a different level after it was created.

[.instruction]
Moving a category to the main category level:

. Go to **Item » Categories**.
