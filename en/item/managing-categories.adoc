There are different types of categories in plentymarkets. On the one hand, categories are what other systems may refer to as product groups or item categories. On the other hand, categories are also content pages for your **CMS**. The different types of categories have many settings in common. For example, all types of categories are managed within a folder structure. This can be achieved by creating main categories and up to 5 levels of subcategories. All types of categories also typically include texts such as a description, short description, meta description and graphic elements. This is why all types of categories are managed together in plentymarkets.

* CANONICAL
* CLIENTS
* SITEMAP
////

The categories in plentymarkets can be categorised by their type. The types **Item**, **Content** and **Container** are available. By managing all types of categories together, each type has access to a few additional settings that would otherwise only be applicable to one of them. In some cases, these settings are also useful for the other types. For example, you can use a template variable to insert a short description for the type **Content**. You can use tags for the type **Item**.

== Preparation

=== Setting the category levels

First decide how many category levels should be displayed in the online store. Carry out these settings for each client. For example, if you select 4 levels, no categories can be created on the 5th level. This setting applies to the complete category tree, i.e. to all category types.

[.instruction]
Setting the category levels:

. Go to **System » System settings » Client » Select client » Categories » Settings**.
. Select the maximum number of levels in the category navigation.
. **Save** the setting.

=== Planning the structure of item categories

Set up a logical category structure before you begin creating categories. Before you start creating item categories, consider the products of your portfolio and divide these products into possible groups of categories and subcategories. <<table-category-structures-examples>> shows two simplified examples of different item structures.

== Creating a category

Create new categories either as main categories or as subcategories. Main categories are those categories at the top level. Subcategories are those categories on all the other, lower levels of the category tree. Find out how to create main categories and subcategories in the separate descriptions below.

[TIP]
.Default category "Content"
====
Each system contains a category named **Content** by default. You cannot create additional categories called **Content**. You cannot change the name or the URL name of the category **Content**. You can change settings of this category that do not relate to the name, e.g. the position.

|**Type**
|Select **Item**, **Content** or **Container**.

|**Name**

You can re-use URL names as long as they are used in different categories or on different levels. Within one category, however, the URL names may only be used once per level. +
**__SEO tip:__** Because no client (store) is selected when the category is created, the automatically created URL is not indexed by search engines. However, in terms of SEO it is best not to change the URL name after the category has been activated for a client. +

__**Important:**__

* URL names cannot contain special characters. As such, only enter ASCII code.
* Do not enter the following characters at the beginning of a URL name: +
a-, b-, c-, f-, fa-, p-, t- +
These prefixes are deleted automatically. For instance, "a-class" is changed to "class" automatically. For example, for a category named "a-class", you should enter the URL name "aclass".

|**URL**
|The URL of the category. The URL is generated automatically based on the complete path of the category, i.e. domain plus category levels plus URL name.

**Apply visibility to subcategory** +
This option is only shown if subcategories exist. +
 Place a check mark to apply the category's client visibility to all of its subcategories. This function is only activated until the next time you save the category. This means that you have to place the check mark again every time you want to apply a category's visibility to its subcategories. +
If a visibility is removed (i.e. a check mark is removed from any of the clients and the category is saved), this is applied to the subcategories even if the function is not activated. +
If a visibility is added, then this visibility automatically is set for any parent categories as well.

|**Meta title**
|Enter the meta title. The meta title is displayed both in the tab title of the browser and in search engine results. If you leave this field blank, the category name is used as the title. +

== Creating multilingual category pages

If you want to make your online store available in several different languages, you also need to create categories in these languages. This chapter explains how to create multilingual categories of the type **Content**, the type **Item** and the type **Container**. Of course, this is assuming that you have already created categories in the online store's default language. For further information about the requirements of a multilingual online store, refer to the **<<online-store/online-store/setting-up-clients/multilingual-online-store, Multilingualism>>** page of the manual.

There are two ways to create multilingual categories. You can choose between a multilingual or a monolingual editor. Use the monolingual editor to edit one language version after another. Use the multilingual editor to edit two languages at a time. Both procedures are described below.

=== Creating multilingual categories in the monolingual editor

Proceed as described below to create a language version of an existing category.

[IMPORTANT]
.Visibility of categories in the Item » Categories menu
====
In order for a category to be displayed within the directory tree in the **Item » Categories** menu, you must have already created this category in the system's default language. In other words, you must have at least entered a page name in the default language.
====

[.instruction]
Creating language versions of a category (monolingual):

. Go to **Item » Categories**.
. Open the category that you want to create a language version for.
. Select the desired language from the **Language** drop-down list, e.g. **English**.
. Enter a **name** for the category.
. Select the desired settings under **Template page**, **Template list**, **Template product** and **Full text search**. Pay attention to the settings that were saved for the category in the default language.
. **Save** the settings. +
→ The entry is saved. +
→ The page's path is created and shown in the **URL** field.
. Insert content in the selected language.
. **Save** the settings.

=== Creating a multilingual category in the multilingual view

Proceed as described below to create a language version of a category in the multilingual editor.

[.instruction]
Creating language versions of a category (multilingual):

. Go to **Item » Categories**.
. Click on the desired category in the directory tree. +
→ The category opens.
. Click on the **Multilingualism** icon. +
→ The multilingual view of the category opens in a new tab. +
**__Tip:__** The default language of the online store is shown on the left side by default.
. Select the desired **language** on the right.
. Enter the **Name**, **URL name** and **Meta title**.
. Enter the foreign-language text and content into the **Description 1** text field.
. **Save** the settings. +
→ The category is saved in the selected language.

[TIP]
.Tip: Opening two completely new languages in the bilingual editor
====
You also can open new languages in the bilingual editor, i.e. languages for which no content has been saved yet. You do not necessarily have to open the default language.
====

== Activating a category

You need to activate categories to make them visible in a client's online store. You can activate individual categories or several categories at once.

Categories are only visible in the online store if the following requirements are met:

. The category must be activated for the client.
. At least one variation must be linked to the category for the client.
. Open the variation and click on the **Categories** tab. Make sure that the category was set to **Available** for the desired clients.
. The variation also has to be available, i.e. the stock has to be positive and the **Store visibility** option must have been set to **Visible** within the **Available** tab.

=== Activating a category

Proceed as described below to activate a category.

[.instruction]

. **Save** the setting. +
→ The category is made visible for the selected clients (stores).


=== Activating several categories

You can activate and/or deactivate several or all categories of a client (store) centrally in the **System » System settings » Client » Select client » Categories » Activate** menu.

[.instruction]
Activating several categories of a client (store):

. Go to **System » System settings » Client » Select client » Categories » Activate**.
. Check the category that you want to activate. +
**__Tip:__** Click on **Select all** to place check marks next to all of the categories. Click on **Deselect all** to remove the check marks from all of the selected categories.
. **Save** the settings.
. Check whether categories and items are displayed correctly in the online store. +
**__Tip:__** It might take some time until an activated category is visible in the online store. If problems occur, check the settings and reload the page of your store.

== Managing categories

=== Filtering categories

Categories can be filtered by client, language and type. The filters are located above the directory tree. The font indicates if a category is available in the selected combination. Categories that are displayed in normal font are available in the selected combination. Categories displayed in italic font are not available in the selected filter combination of client, language and type.

=== Searching for a category

The search function helps you find categories quickly. Enter the name of the category into the text field. Search results appear while you enter the name.

=== Copy category

The **Copy category** function allows you to create the same subcategory in several different parent categories. For example, this is useful if you want to have categories for women's, men's and children's clothing, and all three categories should include trousers as a subcategory. Copy the category with all of its settings and then make changes to the name and the description as needed.

[.instruction]
Copying a category:

. Click on **Copy**. +
→ The category is displayed under the selected category in the directory tree.
. If necessary, change the category's position to sort it correctly.

=== Move category

Categories are displayed in the selected structure under **Item » Categories**. The category structure and category names form the basis for the navigation menu displayed in the online store. On the one hand, the structure is determined by the main and subcategories and by the relationship of the categories one another. These are the so-called levels. On the other hand, the structure is determined by the position numbers. Use the category positions to specify the order within a category level. Use the **Move category** function to move a category to a different level after it was created.

[.instruction]
Moving a category to the main category level:

. Go to **Item » Categories**.
. Point your cursor over a category.
. Click on the triangle to the right of a category. +

=== Deleting a category

You either can delete a category completely or only delete the combination of client (store) and language that is shown. Both procedures are described below.

==== Deleting a category completely

Categories can be deleted by either opening the context menu or via the toolbar of the category. In both cases, the category is deleted from the system completely. In other words, all client and language versions of this category are deleted.

→ The **Delete** window is displayed.
. Click on **Delete category** to delete the category completely. +
→ The complete category is deleted.
