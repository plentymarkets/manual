Units such as kilograms, litres and centimetres help you define the size or dimensions of your products.

There are 52 units saved according to their ISO code in plentymarkets by default. However, you can <<item/settings/units#100, create additional units of measure>> or edit the existing units as needed.

You can also <<item/settings/units#200, create variations>> by combining units with different quantities. For example, you might sell a bottle of soap that’s available in 50ml, 100ml or 150ml.

You’ve surely seen an item’s <<item/settings/units#300, unit price>> displayed on the shelves in grocery stores. The unit price tells you how much the item costs per pound, litre or other unit of measure. It’s calculated based on the item’s content, unit and price. It can be displayed on various sales channels and on item labels.
