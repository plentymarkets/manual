You are legally required to provide information in your online store about how long it takes to deliver all items that you offer. There are ten availability options in plentymarkets.

First, configure the ten availability levels. In a second step, you’ll define the <<item/managing-items#intable-symbol, availability of each item>>.

[#100]
== Configuring the availability levels

Enter the availability texts one-time only in the plentymarkets back end. You can also replace the default availability icons with your own icons.

[.instruction]
Setting the availability options:

. Go to *Setup » Item » Availability*.
. Carry out the settings. Note <<table-define-availability>>.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

|Setting |Explanation

| *ID*
|The IDs 1-10 are automatically assigned by plentymarkets and cannot be changed.

*_Use case_*: Imagine you want to <<data/importing-data/sync-types/elasticSync-item#2300, import lots of item data with the help of a CSV file>>. Among other things, you want to specify the availability of each item. You can use the IDs 1-10 to specify the availability of each item.

| *Backend icon*
|The default availability icons of the system are displayed here. These icons are set by default and can be replaced with individual icons.

| *Name*
|Enter a name or a description for the delivery time, e.g. ships within 48 hours, 3-5 business days, etc.

*_Tip_*: Choose a different language from the drop-down list if you want to save the availability texts in multiple languages.

| **Average delivery period**
|Enter the average delivery time in days. These values will be analysed by search engines.

*_Tip_*: Enter realistic delivery times, as this information is considered to be a promise and it is also relevant in terms of competition law.

| *Online store icon*
|Here you’ll see three buttons.
Click on the button on the far left to open a detailed view of the symbol.
