Who makes your products? Do your manufacturers get paid a commission? plentymarkets helps you manage your manufacturers.
You can either <<item/settings/manufacturers#150, manually create>> manufacturer data records or you can <<item/settings/manufacturers#200, import>> them. You can also <<item/settings/manufacturers#300, save commissions for your manufacturers>> and specify <<item/settings/manufacturers#400, who manufacturers each of your items>>.

[#100]
== Creating manufacturer data records

Create a data record for each of your manufacturers.
If you only want to create data records for a few manufacturers, then we would recommend <<item/settings/manufacturers#150, creating them manually>>.
However, if you have a lot of different manufacturers, then it will probably be quicker to <<item/settings/manufacturers#200, import your manufacturer data>>.

[#150]
=== Manual creation

. Go to *Setup » Item » Manufacturers*.
. Click on icon:plus[role="green"] *New*. +
→ The *New manufacturer* tab opens.
. Enter the manufacturer data. Note <<table-add-manufacturers>>.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings. +
→ The manufacturer is added.

| *External name*

| *Position*
|Enter a position number for the manufacturer.
If you leave this field blank, then the position number 0 will automatically be assigned.

Manufacturer data records can be sorted by their position number in the menu *Setup » Item » Manufacturers*.
Move your mouse cursor over the column header *Position*.
Click on the small triangle (icon:caret-down[role="darkGrey"]) to sort the manufacturers in ascending or descending order by their position number.
Manufacturers with identical positions are sorted by name.

|Enter an optional comment about the manufacturer.
This is an internal comment, i.e. it is only visible in your plentymarkets system.

[TIP]
.Can I save my manufacturer data in the CRM menu instead?
====
Maybe you noticed that it’s possible to <<crm/managing-contacts#90, create manufacturer data records in the CRM menu>>. But be careful. This data is _not_ transferred over to the menu *Setup » Item » Manufacturers*. Therefore, we recommend that you ignore the manufacturer data in the CRM menu for now.
====

[#200]
=== Import

plentymarkets has an <<data/importing-data/ElasticSync#, import tool>>.
The idea is simple. Rather than manually saving manufacturer information in plentymarkets, you’ll <<data/importing-data/sync-types/elasticSync-manufacturer#, enter the same information into a CSV file>> and then import this file into your system.

[#300]
== Adding commissions

Have you already <<item/settings/manufacturers#100, saved basic manufacturer data>>? Then you’re ready to add commission models as needed.

[.instruction]
Adding manufacturer commissions:

. Go to *Setup » Item » Manufacturers*.
. Click on *Edit* (icon:pencil[role="yellow"]). +
→ The manufacturer data record opens in a new tab.
. Open the *Commissions* tab.
. Click on *Add* (icon:plus[role="green"]). +
→ A new line for commissions is added to the table.
. Enter information about the commission. Note <<table-add-manufacturer-commission>>.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings. +
→ An ID is assigned to the commission automatically.

[[table-add-manufacturer-commission]]
.Adding commissions for manufacturers
[cols="1,3"]
|====
|Setting |Explanation

| *Client (store)*
|Which company does the commission apply to? Select a client from the drop-down list.

| *Referrer*
|Which market or sales platform does the commission apply to? Select the order referrer from the drop-down list.

| *Commission*

[TIP]
.Transferring commissions to other manufacturers
====
Do the same commission models apply to several different manufacturers? You don’t have to manually save each commission! Simply copy a commission and transfer it to other manufacturers.

First, click on *Copy commission to other manufacturers* (icon:copy[set=plenty, role="yellow"]). Then use check marks (icon:check-square[role="blue"]) to specify which commission you want to copy and which manufacturers you want to transfer it to.
Finally, click on icon:save[role="green"] *Copy commission*.

== Linking manufacturers to items

Once you’ve saved your manufacturer data in plentymarkets, you’ll specify who manufactured each individual item. This is done by linking each item with a manufacturer.

There are several different ways to link items to manufacturers:

* Specify the manufacturer <<item/import-export-create/create/new-item#200, while you manually create a new item>>.
* Specify the manufacturer <<item/managing-items#40, in an existing item’s Global tab>>.
* <<item/import-export-create/create/mass-processing#100, Use the group function>> to manually specify the manufacturer for several existing items at once.
* Do you want to import your items? Then <<data/importing-data/sync-types/elasticSync-item#2260, specify each item’s manufacturer in the CSV file>> that you will import.

[#500]
