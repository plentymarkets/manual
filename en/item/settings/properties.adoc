Some items stand out from the crowd. Be it a watch that is water resistant or a loudspeaker that has Bluetooth technology.

In plentymarkets, such distinguishing features are called characteristics and properties. The difference is that <<item/settings/properties#500, properties>> define _specific variations_ whereas <<item/settings/properties#100, characteristics>> define _entire items_.

With the help of characteristics and properties, for example, you can:

* highlight the technical features of a product.
* <<item/frontend-item-search#80, set up filters in your online store>> that help customers refine their search results.
* sell <<item/use-cases/personalised-items#, personalised items>>.

[TIP]
.Other ways to characterise products
====
Do you want to simultaneously characterise your products and create <<item/introduction/structure#, saleable variations>>, e.g. a t-shirt in the colour red and the size S? This can be done with the help of <<item/settings/attributes#, attributes>>!

[#100]
== Characteristics

Characteristics are _passive features_ of an item. That means they are not linked to stock.
With characteristics, you can highlight features of items, for example technical details such as Bluetooth or Wi-Fi, etc.
Such details can also be <<item/frontend-item-search#80, turned into the filters>> that customers use to narrow down their search results in the online store.

image::item/settings/assets/filter.png[]

With the help of so-called _order characteristics_, you can also sell <<item/use-cases/personalised-items#, personalised items>>.
For example, services for an additional fee or special requests when placing an order.

[TIP]
.What’s the difference between characteristics and properties?
====
Characteristics are linked to items. As such, they apply to all variations of the item. Characteristics are out of date and will gradually be replaced by <<item/settings/properties#500, properties>>. Properties are linked to variations. As such, they are much more flexible.
====

[#200]
=== Creating characteristic groups

There are two typical applications for characteristic groups. On the one hand, if you have lots of characteristics, then you can group them together so that it’s easier to keep track of them in your plentymarkets back end.

On the other hand, characteristic groups help you sell <<item/use-cases/personalised-items#, personalised items>> in your online store.
You can use characteristic groups to sort the additional options and services that you offer under one heading.

[TIP]
.Example: Group various trimmings
====
Imagine you sell wedding rings. Your customers can choose an optional gold or diamond trim for an additional fee.
You can create a characteristic group called “Trim” to clearly display these options.
Within this group, customers can choose the options “Gold trim” or “Diamond trim”.
====

[.instruction]
Creating a new characteristic group:

. Go to *Setup » Item » Characteristics*.
. Click on the *New characteristic group* tab.
. Carry out the settings. Note <<table-create-characteristic-groups>>.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

[#300]
=== Creating characteristics

Characteristics allow you to highlight a product’s features.
For example, you might want to specify technical details like Bluetooth or WLAN. Or you might want to offer extra services and options for an additional fee.

[.instruction]
Creating a new characteristic:

. Go to *Setup » Item » Characteristics*.
. Click on the *New characteristic* tab.
. Carry out the settings. Note <<table-create-characteristic>>.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

[#350]
=== Linking characteristics to items

include::../_textblocks/config/link-characteristic-to-item.adoc[]

[#500]
== Properties

Properties help you highlight items, contacts or storage locations. For example, you can use properties to:

* highlight a variation’s technical features such as Bluetooth or WLAN
* specify which storage locations are appropriate for <<#550, items requiring refrigeration>>
* display text fields that customers can write additional requests in

Properties are <<#600, created centrally>> in the menu *Setup » Settings » Properties » Configuration* and then they are linked to <<item/managing-items#4800, variations>>, <<crm/managing-contacts#, contacts>> or <<stock-management/setting-up-a-warehouse#500, storage locations>>.

Properties that are assigned to the *Item* section are linked to variations. These properties differ from <<#100, characteristics>>, which are linked to items. You can create up to 500 variation properties and link them to variations.

Unlike <<item/settings/attributes#, attributes>>, properties are passive. As such, properties cannot be used to create variations. Properties are not linked to stock and also cannot be selected in the detailed view of an item in the online store.

You can also use properties to link your variations with the <<markets/amazon/amazon-setup#1390, properties used on markets like Amazon>>. Furthermore, your customers can <<item/frontend-item-search#, search for properties in the online store>> and find variations linked to this property.

[#550]
[TIP]
.Practical example: Storing items in the right spot
====
Do you have items that need to be stored in a specific place? For example, some food items should _only_ be stored in refrigerators or freezers. Characterise your storage locations and make sure your items always end up in the right spot.

What you’ll need to do:

* <<#600, Create a property>> and assign it to the section *Storage location*.
* Link the property to all of the <<item/managing-items#4900, appropriate items>>, e.g. with perishable goods.
* Link the property to all of the <<stock-management/setting-up-a-warehouse#500, appropriate storage locations>>, e.g. with refrigerators and freezers.
* <<stock-management/new-incoming-items#450, When receiving items>>, you’ll automatically be suggested the appropriate storage location for the item.
