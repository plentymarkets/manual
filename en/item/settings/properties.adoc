Some items stand out from the crowd. Be it a watch that is water resistant or a loudspeaker that has Bluetooth technology.

In plentymarkets, such distinguishing features are called characteristics and properties. Characteristics and properties help you highlight a product’s technical features. The difference is that <<item/settings/properties#500, properties>> define _specific variations_ whereas <<item/settings/properties#100, characteristics>> define _entire items_.

[TIP]
.Other ways to characterise products
====
Do you want to simultaneously characterise your products and create <<item/introduction/structure#, saleable variations>>, e.g. a t-shirt in the colour red and the size S? This can be done with the help of <<item/settings/attributes#, attributes>>!
====

[#100]
== Characteristics

Characteristics are the distinguishing features of an item. Unlike <<item/settings/attributes#, attributes>>, characteristics are passive. As such, characteristics are not required to create variations. Besides, characteristics cannot be selected in the detailed view of an item in the online store. With characteristics, you can highlight features of items, for example technical details such as Bluetooth or Wi-Fi, etc.

Characteristics are passive and are not connected to stock. By using order characteristics, you can provide services for an additional charge or integrate a text field for a customer's additional requests. When setting up the characteristics search, you can use characteristics to provide your customers with a more specific search. Characteristics also allow you to link your items with the characteristics for variations of a market.

[TIP]
.What’s the difference between characteristics and properties?
====
Characteristics are linked to items. As such, they apply to all variations of the item. Characteristics are out of date and will gradually be replaced by <<item/settings/properties#500, properties>>. Properties are linked to variations. As such, they are much more flexible.
====

[#200]
=== Creating characteristic groups

Create characteristic groups to sort your characteristics into groups. If you need a large number of characteristics, then use groups to keep track of them all. When linking items with characteristics, the characteristics will be displayed in the assigned characteristic groups.

[.instruction]
Creating a new characteristic group:

. Go to *Setup » Item » Characteristics*.
. Click on the *New characteristic group* tab.
. Carry out the settings. Note <<table-create-characteristic-groups>>.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

|*Language: Name*
|Enter the name in the selected language. The name is displayed in the online store.

|*Language: Description*
|Enter a description in the selected language.

|*Surcharges*
|*Flat rate* or *in percent*. This setting is used for calculating surcharges.

|*Grouping of order characteristics (type: "none")*
a|This option can only be used for order characteristics of the type *none*. How should the order characteristics be grouped?

* *None* = Order characteristics are not grouped by default.
* *Single selection* = One of the grouped order characteristics can be selected from the drop-down list.
* *Multiple selection* = Multiple order characteristics can be selected. +

|*OTTO characteristic group*
a|If needed, link a characteristic group to OTTO. All of the characteristics in this group will be transferred to OTTO. All of the characteristics will be grouped into a SellingPoint.

* *None* = No link to OTTO.
* *SellingPoint with group names* = Link to OTTO. The name of the group will be transferred.
* *SellingPoint without group names* = Link to OTTO. The name of the group will not be transferred.

[[table-create-characteristic]]
.Creating a new characteristic
[cols="1,2"]
|====
|Setting |Explanation

|*Name (internal)*
|Enter an internal name for the characteristic. The internal name is displayed in the *Characteristics* tab of an item.

|*Online store: Language*
|Select the language in which the characteristic is displayed in the online store.

|*Online store: Name*
|Enter a name for the characteristic. The name is displayed in the detailed view of an item in the online store.

|*Online store: Description*
|Enter a description for the characteristic. The description will be displayed if you place the cursor on the characteristic.

|*Unit*
|Select a <<item/settings/units#, unit>>.

|*Characteristic group*
|Select a <<item/settings/properties#200, characteristic group>>.

|*Characteristic type*
a|Select the characteristic type. Once a characteristic has been linked to one or more items, it is no longer possible to change the characteristic type.

* *No* = Do not select a characteristic type.
* *Whole number* = Allows you to enter a whole number between -2,147,483,648 and 2,147,483,647 into the item’s *Characteristics* tab. For example, the number could be a size.
* *Decimal number* = Allows you to enter a number with decimal places in the item's *Characteristics* tab, for example a measurement.
* *Text* = Allows you to enter text in the item's *Characteristics* tab.
* *Selection* = Additional options will be displayed.

. Save.
. Scroll down in the window and enter another name, for example version 2.0.
. *_Optional:_* Repeat the process. +
→ Every time you save your entry, a new empty field for further selection will be created.

* *File* = Allows you to upload a file in the item's *Characteristics* tab.

|*Surcharge*
a|Enter a value if a surcharge is to be added for the characteristic. Surcharges will automatically be added to the item price in the detailed view of an item and in the order process. The value *0.00* is set by default, i.e. no surcharge will be calculated.

* *Display as additional costs* = VAT will not be taken into account for the entered surcharge. One possible use for this option is to set up a bottle deposit which is added to the item price without calculating VAT. Characteristics that have this option selected will be displayed as separate items on invoices etc. These items will be displayed with the *ID -2*.

|*Position*
|Enter the position number. Characteristics can be sorted by their position numbers.

|*Searchable*
|Activate to search for items with this characteristic when entering the characteristic as the search term.

|*Show*
a|Activate options.

* *Show on the item's page in the online store* = The characteristic will be displayed on the product page.
* *Show in the item listing in the online store* = The characteristic will be displayed in the item list.
* *Display in order process* = The characteristic will be displayed in the order process.
* *Show in PDF documents* = The characteristic will be displayed in PDF documents.

|*Order characteristic*
|Activate to make the characteristic available in the order process. Depending on the *characteristic type*, the customer can for example enter a text or value or select an option from a drop-down list.

|*Note*
|Enter a note, for example to display specific information about the characteristic.

|Characteristic links for markets and price comparison portals
|Select the marketplace characteristic from the drop-down list. This links the characteristic with a <<markets/amazon/amazon-setup#1400, characteristic on a marketplace like Amazon>>.
|====

<<item/managing-items#80, Link any number of characteristics with an item>>. Customers can search for characteristics in the online store by using the linked characteristics.

[#400]
=== Changing characteristic values via group function

The *group function* allows you to edit the characteristic values for all items linked with this characteristic value at once.

[.instruction]
Changing a characteristic's value with a group function:

. Go to *Setup » Item » Characteristics*.
. Click on the *Group function* tab.
. Select the characteristic's language.
. Select the characteristic from the *Characteristic selection* drop-down list for which you want to change a value.
. Enter the old value into the *Value to be changed* field.
. Enter the *new value*.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings. +
→ The characteristic value is changed for all items with this value.

[#500]
== Properties

Properties help you highlight items, contacts or storage locations. For example, you can use properties to:

* highlight a variation’s technical features such as Bluetooth or WLAN
* specify which storage locations are appropriate for <<item/settings/properties#550, items requiring refrigeration>>
* display text fields that customers can write additional requests in

Properties are <<item/settings/properties#600, created centrally>> in the menu *Setup » Settings » Properties » Configuration* and then they are linked to <<item/managing-items#4800, variations>>, <<crm/managing-contacts#, contacts>> or <<stock-management/setting-up-a-warehouse#500, storage locations>>.

Properties that are assigned to the *Item* section are linked to variations. These properties differ from <<item/settings/properties#100, characteristics>>, which are linked to items. You can create up to 500 variation properties and link them to variations.

Unlike <<item/settings/attributes#, attributes>>, properties are passive. As such, properties cannot be used to create variations. Properties are not linked to stock and also cannot be selected in the detailed view of an item in the online store.

You can also use properties to link your variations with the <<markets/amazon/amazon-setup#1390, properties used on markets like Amazon>>. Furthermore, your customers can <<item/frontend-item-search#, search for properties in the online store>> and find variations linked to this property.

[#550]
[TIP]
.Practical example: Storing items in the right spot
====
Do you have items that need to be stored in a specific place? For example, some food items should _only_ be stored in refrigerators or freezers. Characterise your storage locations and make sure your items always end up in the right spot.

What you’ll need to do:

* <<item/settings/properties#600, Create a property>> and assign it to the section *Storage location*.
* Link the property to all of the <<item/managing-items#4900, appropriate items>>, e.g. with perishable goods.
* Link the property to all of the <<stock-management/setting-up-a-warehouse#500, appropriate storage locations>>, e.g. with refrigerators and freezers.
* <<stock-management/new-incoming-items#450, When receiving items>>, you’ll automatically be suggested the appropriate storage location for the item.
