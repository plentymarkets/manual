Barcodes are used to uniquely identify items. They are often displayed e.g. on item labels or on documents like invoices and delivery notes. This pages helps you configure barcodes step by step in plentymarkets.

First, you’ll <<item/settings/barcodes#100, configure barcode types>>. In other words, you’ll specify whether you need GTIN, ISBN, UPC or QR barcodes and which sales platforms you need the barcodes for.

If you don’t get barcodes directly from your manufacturer, i.e. if you sell your own brand of products, then you’ll need to <<item/settings/barcodes#200, acquire the actual barcodes from an organisation like GS1>>. For example, you might buy a range of 1000 barcode numbers. You’ll tell plentymarkets which barcodes you’ve bought by saving information about the number range.

Then you’ll <<item/settings/barcodes#300, assign the barcodes to your items>>. In other words, you’ll link your barcodes to your item variations.

Finally, you’ll decide where you want the barcodes to be displayed. For example, if you want to display barcodes on item labels, then you’ll need to <<item/settings/barcodes#900, design the labels>> and <<item/settings/barcodes#1000, print them out>>.

== Configuring barcode types

Which types of barcodes do you need? Which sales platforms will you use each type of barcode on? First, save some basic information about your barcodes.

[.instruction]
Configuring barcodes:

. Go to *Setup » Item » Barcode*.
. Click on icon:plus[role="green"] *New barcode*. +
→ The *New barcode* window opens.
. Enter the name.
. Select the type. Note <<table-barcode-types>>.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings. +
→ The barcode configuration is automatically given an ID and the settings open in a new tab.
. Select (icon:check-square[role="blue"]) one or more referrers.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

.Barcode types
[cols="1,2"]
|====
|Setting |Explanation

|*GTIN 8*; +
*GTIN 13*; +
*GTIN 14*; +
*GTIN 128*
|The Global Trade Item Number (formerly European Article Number, EAN) is a product barcode for items. The GTIN consists of 8, 13, 14 or a maximum of 128 characters and is centrally administered and issued for manufacturers upon request.

13-digit GTINs consist of the basic group, the item reference and the check digit. The basic group has 7 to 9 digits and contains the GS1 prefix with the country code, for example 500 to 509 for the UK, as well as the company number. The item reference of the manufacturer consists of 3 to 5 digits (depending on the basic group's length). The check digit is the last digit.

|*ISBN*
|The International Standard Book Number is a unique number of 10 or 13 characters to register books and other independent, discontinuous publications like multimedia products and software.

|*QR*
|Quick Response Code. The code contains data such as the version, the data format and other information.

|*CODE 128*
|Alphanumeric barcode. The Code128 consists of start character, encoded data, check character and stop character.

|*UPC*
|The Universal Product Code is a product barcode for items. The UPC is a 12-digit number. By adding a leading *0*, this barcode can be used as a 13-digit GTIN.
|====

[TIP]
.Example: FNSKU barcodes
====
Even though there’s not a specific barcode type for FNSKU, you can still configure FNSKU barcodes in plentymarkets. Enter a meaningful name and select the desired type, e.g. Code 128.
====

[#200]
== Acquiring barcodes and saving a number range

Many sellers do not have GTINs (barcodes) for their items because they directly import their items and the manufacturer does not assign GTINs. In this case, sellers can acquire GTINs from an organisation like link:https://www.gs1uk.org/[GS1^]. For example, sellers can buy a range of 1000 barcode numbers.

But how do you get these barcodes into plentymarkets? You don’t need to import them! Simply tell plentymarkets how many GTINs you have and which number your range begins with. Then when you <<item/settings/barcodes#300, assign a barcode to an item>>, the next available barcode will automatically be used.

[.instruction]
Saving a GTIN number range:

. Go to *Setup » Item » GTIN*.
. Enter the starting value. +
→ For 13 digit GTINs this must be a 12 digit value. The check digit is entered automatically.
. Enter the number of GTINs.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

[TIP]
.Why doesn't the number range look consecutive?
====
At first glance, it might not look like the numbers always increase by 1. But don’t forget that the last digit is a check digit. The 12 places before it are consecutive. Leave out the check digit when you enter the starting value.
====

[#300]
== Assigning barcodes to items

How many products would you like to add barcodes to? If you only have a few products, then it will probably be quickest to <<item/settings/barcodes#400, manually link barcodes>>. However, if you have a lot of products, then it will probably be faster to <<item/settings/barcodes#500, import the barcodes>>.

But what if you purchased your own barcodes and saved a number range? In this case, plentymarkets can <<item/settings/barcodes#600, automatically assign the next available barcode>> to your products.

[TIP]
.Barcodes are saved for individual variations
====
Technically speaking, a barcode is linked to <<item/introduction/structure#, an individual variation>> and not to the item as a whole. So if you sell a t-shirt in the colours red or blue, for example, then the red and blue t-shirts will each have their own barcode.
====

[#400]
=== Manually assigning barcodes to items

[.instruction]
Manually assigning barcodes to items:

. Go to *Item » Edit item*.
. Open the item. +
→ The *Settings* tab of the main variation opens.
. In the *Barcode* area, select the <<item/settings/barcodes#100, previously saved barcode configuration>> from the drop-down list.
. Click on *Add* (icon:plus[role="green"]). +
→ The barcode type is added and displayed in the list.
. Enter the code into the *Code* field.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

[#500]
=== Importing barcodes with ElasticSync

<<data/importing-data/ElasticSync#, ElasticSync>> is a useful tool for importing several barcodes at once. The idea is simple. Rather than manually assigning barcodes to items, you’ll enter the same information into a CSV file and then import this file into your system.

Instead of selecting the barcode type in the item data record, you’ll <<data/importing-data/sync-types/elasticSync-item#1910, use the barcode type as a matching field>>. And instead of manually entering the barcode in the item data record, you’ll <<data/importing-data/sync-types/elasticSync-item#2320, enter the barcode in a mapping field>>.

[#600]
=== Automatically assigning barcodes from the number range

If you bought a <<item/settings/barcodes#200, range of GTIN 13 barcodes>>, then plentymarkets can automatically assign the next available barcode to your item.

[.instruction]
Automatically assigning barcodes from the number range:

. Go to *Item » Edit item*.
. Open the item. +
→ The *Settings* tab of the main variation opens.
. In the *Barcode* area, select the <<item/settings/barcodes#100, previously saved GTIN 13 barcode configuration>> from the drop-down list.
. Click on *Add* (icon:plus[role="green"]). +
→ The barcode type is added and displayed in the list.
. Click on *Generate GTIN* (icon:cog[role="darkGrey", stack="arrow-right,lr"]) to automatically insert the next available barcode.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

[TIP]
.Editing several variations at once
====
//nachdem die Artikel-Verwalten-Seite überarbeitet wurde, passe den Links an, da sie vermutlich nicht zum gleichen Ziel führen sollen.
Use the <<item/managing-items#330, variation group function>> or <<item/managing-items#330, variation batch processing>> to assign GTINs to several variations at the same time.
====

[#700]
=== Troubleshooting: Finding duplicate barcodes

It’s technically possible to save the same barcode for multiple variations. If you don’t want duplicate barcodes, then you can search for and correct any duplicate codes in the system. The search is designed to locate identical codes of the same barcode type that are saved for different variations.

[.instruction]
Finding duplicate barcodes:

. Go to *Setup » Item » Barcode*.
. Click on *Search* (icon:search[role="blue"]). +
→ The *Duplicate barcodes* tab opens.
. In the filter options, click on *Search* (icon:search[role="blue"]) to list all of the duplicate barcodes. +
*__Tip:__* In the filter options, enter a *Variation ID* or a *Barcode* to limit the search results. +
→ The duplicate codes are listed.
. Click on the variation you want to edit. +
→ The variation opens.
. Edit the variation's code.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

[#800]
== Labels

Item labels are attached to an item or to the item packaging. They include information like the price, content, barcode etc. First, you’ll <<item/settings/barcodes#900, design your labels>> with the help of templates. Then you’ll <<item/settings/barcodes#1000, generate your labels>> and print them out.

[#900]
=== Designing labels

You’ll design your labels with the help of templates. Each template includes information about the size of the label, which data should be displayed on the label and where each piece of data should be positioned on the label. You can create up to 10 label templates.

[.instruction]
Creating a label template:

. Go to *Setup » Item » Labels*.
. Expand the *New template* area (icon:plus-square-o[role="darkGrey"]).
. Carry out the settings. Note <<table-create-label-template>>. +
*_Tip:_* The labels only show values for which X and Y coordinates have been saved.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings. +
→ The label template is created.

[TIP]
.Working with the X-Y coordinate system
====
Use X-Y coordinates to specify _which information_ should be displayed on the label and _where each piece of information_ should be positioned.

*_Which info_*: The labels only show values for which X and Y coordinates have been saved. In other words, enter coordinates for each piece of information that should appear on the label.

*_Position of the info_*: Enter coordinates to position the item data on the label. The values are based on a coordinate system with an x-axis and a y-axis. The X-axis runs from left to right and the Y-axis from top to bottom. The points of origin are in the upper left corner.
====

[TIP]
.Controlling the appearance of the label
====
Do you want to display the item data in normal or bold font? Should the data be small or large? Use the drop-down lists to choose the font size and style.

Do you want to display the title of certain item parameters? Should the text wrap around to the next line if it exceeds the width of the label? Place check marks (icon:check-square[role="blue"]) next to the options *Hide title* and *Allow line break*.

=== Generating and printing labels

Do you want to generate the label for a _specific variation_ or for _all of the items that belong to a specific order_? Do you want to generate the item label _manually_ or _automatically_? There are many different ways to generate labels.

* You manually generate a <<item/settings/barcodes#1050, label for a specific storage location>>.
* You manually generate a <<item/settings/barcodes#1100, label for a specific variation>>.
* You manually generate <<item/settings/barcodes#1200, labels for all of the items in a specific order>>.
* You manually print item labels <<item/settings/barcodes#1300, with the plentymarkets app>>.
* You automatically print labels <<item/settings/barcodes#1400, while receiving goods>>.

[#1050]
==== Generating a label for a specific storage location

[.instruction]
Generating a label for a storage location:

. Go to *Item » Edit item*.
. Open the item.
. Open the variation.
. Click on the *Warehouse* tab.
. Make sure you’ve selected a storage location in the field *Suggested storage location*.
. Click on the label symbol (icon:barcode[role="blue"]) further to the right. +
→ The *Generate labels* window opens.
. Enter the number of labels to generate.
. Select a label template from the drop-down list.
. Click on *Generate labels* (icon:cog[role="darkGrey", stack="arrow-right,lr"]). +
→ A PDF file with the selected number of labels is generated.

[TIP]
.Why do I only ever see the default storage location on my labels?
====
Have you saved a suggested storage location for the variation? Open the variation and click on the *Warehouse* tab. Make sure you’ve selected a storage location in the field *Suggested storage location*. If no storage location was selected for a variation, then the default storage location will automatically be used as a placeholder instead.

Did you click on the correct label symbol? Click on the label symbol (icon:barcode[role="blue"]) further to the right in the *Warehouse* tab. If you click on the label symbol in the item toolbar further up, then the default storage location will be displayed on your label. Remember that each variation can be stored in a different location. In other words, an item can have multiple storage locations. So if you generate a label for the entire item, then plentymarkets won’t know which storage location is intended. It will use the default storage location instead.
