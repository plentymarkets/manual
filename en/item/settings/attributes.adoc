Some items like shoes and t-shirts are sold in various sizes and colours. In plentymarkets, such characteristics are called attributes. Attributes help you simultaneously characterise your products and create <<item/introduction/structure#, saleable variations>>, e.g. the t-shirt in the colour red and the size S.

The procedure is as follows. First, you’ll create <<item/settings/attributes#100, attributes>> like colour and their corresponding <<item/settings/attributes#200, values>> like red, blue and green. Then you’ll combine attribute values together to <<item/settings/attributes#300, create variations>>. For example, you would get 9 different variations if you combine the sizes S, M, L with the colours red, blue and green. This video offers you a playful introduction to the topic:

Do you sell your products on markets like Amazon and eBay? Some markets require you to <<item/settings/attributes#500, link your own attribute values with their attribute values>>.

Optionally, you can also <<item/settings/attributes#600, add images>> to visually represent your attribute values. Or you can save the names of attributes and their values <<item/settings/attributes#1000, in multiple languages>>.

[TIP]
.Other ways to characterise products
====
Do you want to characterise your products _without_ building variations? For example, do you only want to highlight the technical features of a product in your store? This is done with the help of <<item/settings/properties#, properties and characteristics>>! The difference is that properties define _specific variations_ whereas characteristics define _entire items_.

|*Position*
a|Which attribute should be displayed first, second, third, etc? Enter a position number into this field. If an item has multiple attributes, then the attributes will be displayed in the store in ascending order according to their position number.

|[#allow-image-link]*Image link possible*
a|Select this option (icon:check-square[role="blue"]) if you want the item image to change, e.g. on eBay, depending on which size or colour a customer chooses. In other words, the appropriate images will automatically be displayed on eBay.

*_Note:_* Although multiple attributes can be linked with one variation, the image link is only possible for one attribute per variation. +
*_Additional settings_*: Link your variations to the appropriate images. Make sure that you’ve made these images available for the marketplace. Then link the variation images to the market attributes. These steps are described in further detail <<item/settings/attributes#900, in another chapter>>.

|[#attribute-selection]*Attribute selection in store*
a|How do you want customers to choose sizes or colours in your store? Should they choose the name from a drop-down list or click on an image?

== Creating variations with the attributes

It’s technically possible to select attributes while <<item/managing-items#20, manually creating a new item>>. However, we don’t recommend doing so.

Rather, we recommend that you first create a new item, i.e. a main variation, without any attributes. Afterwards, we recommend that you select attributes while you <<item/managing-items#160, create additional variations>>.

Why? If you link attributes while creating a new item, then _all of the following variations_ will have to be created from the same attributes too. This is not the case if you wait to link attributes while creating variations. In other words, it makes you much more flexible in the future.

=== Linking attribute values with marketplaces

Some markets, such as <<markets/amazon/amazon-setup#1350, Amazon>> and <<markets/ebay/ebay-setup#6100, eBay>>, require you to link _your own_ attribute values with _their attribute values_.
For example, image you sell a turquoise t-shirt. But the market you want to sell it on only accepts the colours green and blue. Link your own attribute values with the ones on the other market. This ensures that your items are displayed correctly.

This video illustrates the idea with a playful example:

.Link your attributes to those on Amazon

[TIP]
.Linking attribute values with variation images too
====
Should the item image also change depending on which size or colour a customer chooses?
Some markets, such as eBay, require you to also <<item/settings/attributes#900, link your variation images with the appropriate attribute values>>.
====

[#600]
=== Visually displaying attributes

[#700]
==== Displaying attribute values as images

Should the item image change in the online store depending on which size or colour a customer chooses?
Follow the steps below if the appropriate images should automatically be displayed.

[#variation-image-link]
[.instruction]
Linking variations to the appropriate images:

. Go to *Item » Edit item*.
. Open the item.
. Click on the *Images* tab.
. <<item/managing-items#90, Upload the necessary images>>.
. Select the images (icon:check-square[role="blue"]) that you want to link.
. Click on *Variation link* (icon:plus[role="green"]). +
→ The *Variation link* window is displayed.
. Use the filters on the left as needed.
. Choose which variations (icon:check-square[role="blue"]) should be linked to the selected images.
. Click on *Link* (icon:check[role="green"]). +
→ The images are linked with the selected variations.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings. +
→ If a customer chooses the variation in your online store, he will see the appropriate item image.

[#900]
===== Linking variation images to market attributes

Should the item image change, e.g. on eBay, depending on which size or colour a customer chooses?

Some markets like eBay not only require you to <<item/settings/attributes#500, link your attributes with the market>>, but also to link your variation images with the appropriate attribute values.

[TIP]
.Have you met all of the requirements?
====
//nachdem alles umgestellt ist, mache den Link auf Marktplatz-Verfügbarkeit eindeutiger, nicht ganze Kapitel sondern Einstellung
Make sure you’ve already <<item/settings/attributes#variation-image-link, linked your variations with the appropriate images>> and that you’ve <<item/managing-items#90, made the images available for the marketplace>>. Furthermore, make sure you’ve <<item/settings/attributes#allow-image-link, allowed image links in the basic settings>>.
====

[.instruction]
Linking variation images to market attributes:

. Go to *Item » Edit item*.
. Open the item.
. Click on the *Images* tab.
. Select the appropriate attribute value for the item image from the *Market attribute link* drop-down list.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings. +
→ If a customer chooses the variation on eBay, he will see the appropriate item image.

[TIP]
.Where do I find the “Market attribute link” field?
====
This option is only displayed if the image has been <<item/settings/attributes#variation-image-link, linked to one or more variations>>.
====

[#1000]
=== Saving the names in multiple languages

Is your store available in multiple languages? Then you’ll also need to translate the names of your attributes and attribute values.
[.instruction]
Translating the names of attributes:

. Go to *Setup » Item » Attributes*.
. Click on the attribute.
. Click on the *Name* tab.
. Enter the name in as many different languages as needed.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

[TIP]
.How the attribute name is displayed in the online store
====
The name should be as short as possible since it will appear next to a selection box in the online store.
====

[.instruction]
Translating the attribute values:

. Go to *Setup » Item » Attributes*.
. Click on the attribute.
. Click on the *Values* tab.
. Select a language from the *Show language* drop-down list in the header. +
→ Only the text in the *Name* column will change.
. In the *Name* column, enter the attribute values in the selected language.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

[TIP]
.Displaying the name in one language and saving it in another
====
The drop-down list *Save language* indicates which language the name will be saved in when you click on the save icon.
You _won’t_ usually work with this drop-down list since the language is _automatically_ selected here when you choose a language from the *Show language* drop-down list.

However, you can choose a different language from the *Save language* drop-down list if you want to see the name in one language and save it in a different one.

[#1100]
== Deleting attributes

Before you can delete an attribute, you have to delete all of the variations that are linked with this attribute.

→ All items linked with this attribute are displayed.
. Select all of the items (icon:check-square[role="blue"]).
. Click on *Variation group function*. +
→ The *Variation group function* window opens.
. In the *Procedures* area, select the option *Delete variations* (icon:check-square[role="blue"]).
. Click on *Execute* (icon:cog[role="darkGrey", stack="arrow-right,lr"]). +
→ The variations are deleted. +
→ The attribute can now be deleted.

[.instruction]
Deleting an attribute:

. Go to *Setup » Item » Attributes*.
. Click on *Delete* (icon:minus-circle[role="red"]) in the line of an attribute. +
→ A new window opens.
. Click on *Delete* (icon:minus-circle[role="red"]) again to confirm your decision. +
→ The attribute is deleted.
