=== Do the variations have positive net stock?


Note the stock limitation!

The stock level is only important if the variations are limited to net stock.
If you do not manage the stock or if you do not have a limitation, then your variations do not need to have positive net stock.


=== Did you activate the availabilities for the store? +

Open the menu *Setup » Client » Standard Shop » Item layouts » Availability* and make sure you’ve activated the availabilities.

.Your store’s availabilities are activated in this area.

[IMPORTANT]
.Cache
====
Even if the variation is configured correctly, it can still take an hour before the item becomes visible in the online store. This is due to the cache.
