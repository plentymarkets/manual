|Select an existing <<item/settings/prices#1000, price calculation>>.
This will link the price calculation to the selected variations. The variations’ prices will be calculated accordingly.

| *Price change*

. Select a source price and target price.
. Select an operator and enter an absolute value or a percentage.

*_Note_*: You can also apply the operators to one single price. Do so by selecting the same sales price as the source and target.

+ The current price is increased by the amount entered. +

| Setting | Explanation

| **Extra charge 1; +
Extra shipping charge 2**
|Activate and enter a value. This value will be saved as the extra shipping charge for the selected variations.

| *Customs tariff number*
//nach Umstrukturierung, includes verwenden, da Inhalt gleich ist wie für das Varianten-Datenfeld
a|Activate and enter a <<orders/accounting#620, customs tariff number>>.
In plentymarkets, it’s possible to save a different customs tariff number for each variation.

*_Example_*: In some countries, children’s clothing is taxed differently depending on the size.
In this case, it makes sense to save the customs tariff number separately for each variation.

*_Inheritance_*: The customs tariff number is automatically <<item/introduction/inheritance#, passed down>> from the main variation to the sub-variations. This means:

* _you don’t need to enter customs tariff numbers_ for your sub-variations if you want them to have the same customs tariff number as the main variation.
* _you’ll need to enter a different customs tariff number_ for all of the sub-variations that should differ from the main variation.

a|Activate and enter a <<orders/accounting#620, customs tariff number>>.
In plentymarkets, it’s possible to save a different customs tariff number for each variation.

*_Example_*: In some countries, children’s clothing is taxed differently depending on the size.
In this case, it makes sense to save the customs tariff number separately for each variation.

*_Inheritance_*: The customs tariff number is automatically <<item/introduction/inheritance#, passed down>> from the main variation to the sub-variations. This means:

* _you don’t need to enter customs tariff numbers_ for your sub-variations if you want them to have the same customs tariff number as the main variation.
* _you’ll need to enter a different customs tariff number_ for all of the sub-variations that should differ from the main variation.
