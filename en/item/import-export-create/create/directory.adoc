This page serves purely as a reference.
It explains the various tabs and data fields within an item data record.
Links direct you to further information and step-by-step instructions for using the individual data fields in a larger context.

[IMPORTANT]
.Settings differ for each item type
====
Depending on which <<item/import-export-create/create/new-item#intable-type, type of item>> you’re working with, you might see some of the settings described on this page and not others. Don’t worry!
plentymarkets automatically displays the settings that are relevant to your item type and hides the rest.

===== Why are there two rows of tabs?

////
zukunftsmusik - einleitung mit include anpassen, damit die gleiche inhalte hier sind wie in artikel/einleitung/struktur#300
////

An item is a complete data record that always includes one more more variations. An item is composed of general data that applies to _all_ of the item variations (item data) as well as data that is managed separately for each variation (variation data).

In the item data record, you’ll find the item data displayed in the upper row of tabs and variation data displayed in the lower row of tabs.

image::item/introduction/assets/upper-lower-tabs.png[]

[#30]
== Upper row of tabs

Item data is found in the upper row of tabs.
In other words, the upper row of tabs includes general data that applies to _all_ of the item’s variations.

[#40]
=== Global

This tab includes a wide range of basic item options.
Here you’ll also find a timestamp, which tells you when the item data record was created and when it was last modified.

[.instruction]
Saving global item data:

. Go to *Item » Edit item*.
. <<item/introduction/search#100, Search for>> and open the item.
. Click on the *Global* tab in the upper row. This tab is divided into several areas.
. Carry out the settings.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

==== Basic settings

////

[cols="1,3"]
|====
|Setting |Explanation

|[#intable-condition]*Condition*; +
*Condition for API*
|Select the item's condition. **New** is set by default. The *Condition for API* setting is used for the market <<markets/amazon/amazon-setup#, Amazon>>.

| *Type*
//Beschreibung zu einem späteren Zeitpunkt verständlicher machen - die Einstellung hat wohl keine Funktion außer Colli, was für Packstücken verwendet wird
//Beschreibug des Feldes ist auch in die Neue-Artikel-Seite vorhanden
//https://forum.plentymarkets.com/t/warentyp-colli/583522/15

//https://forum.plentymarkets.com/t/woher-kommen-die-zusaetzlichen-versandpakete/356920/25

| Choose **Stocked item** (default setting), **Production item**, **Colli** or **Special order item**. +
**Coli** = Select if the item is to be shipped in several packages. For additional packages, individual items with the stock type Colli must be created in plentymarkets, but these items should not be activated for the plentyShop.

|[#intable-manufacturer]*Manufacturer*
//include mit der Neue-Artikel-Seite einbauen

|Who makes this item? Choose the appropriate manufacturer from the drop-down list.

*_Note_*: This list only includes the <<item/settings/manufacturers#, manufacturer data records>> that you’ve already saved in plentymarkets.

| *Manufacturing country*
|Select the country where the item was manufactured.

| *Revenue account*
|Enter up to 11 digits for the <<orders/accounting#800, revenue account>>.

| *Max. order quantity*
a|Enter a value to limit how many copies of the item can be bought at once.

* 0 = The maximum order quantity applies per variation. This quantity is saved in the variation's tab *Settings* under the option *Max. order quantity*.
* Value greater than 0 = Customers cannot order more than this total quantity. This limit applies to all of the item's variations. Decimal values are possible, e.g. allowing customers to order products by weight or length. This value takes priority over the maximum order quantity saved within the individual variations.

| *Age rating*
|Select the age rating for the item. Items with an **18+ age rating** must be linked to a <<fulfilment/preparing-the-shipment#1000, shipping profile>> for which the **PostIdent** option was activated.

| *Promotional coupon/POS discount*
a| * *Permitted* = Customers can redeem <<pos/integrating-plentymarkets-pos#2100, promotional codes>> when they buy a variation of this item. Cashiers can grant discounts while selling the item with plentyPOS. Customer class discounts are applied automatically. +
* *Not permitted* = Customers cannot redeem <<pos/integrating-plentymarkets-pos#2100, promotional codes>> when they buy a variation of this item. Cashiers cannot grant discounts while selling the item with plentyPOS. Customer class discounts are not applied. +
* *Purchasable with coupon only* = The item variation can only be purchased if a <<pos/integrating-plentymarkets-pos#2100, promotional code>> was entered. +

| *Subscription*
|Specify whether a <<orders/scheduler#, subscription>> is available for the item. Subscriptions are set up in the scheduler. The scheduler is an individual module in plentymarkets that allows an item to be shipped in regular intervals. The scheduler menu is only visible in plentymarkets if you’ve **link:https://www.plentymarkets.com/product/pricing/[booked the module]{nbsp}icon:external-link[]**.

| *Shipping package*
|Do you want to use <<fulfilment/preparing-the-shipment#1900, shipping packages>> for this item? Shipping packages have specific dimensions. If you enter <<item/managing-items#270, dimensions for your variations>>, then the appropriate shipping package will automatically be assigned.

| *Serial number*
|Should it be possible to <<item/use-cases/serial-numbers#800, scan this item’s serial number during a process>>?
|====

==== Item image

Click on the image to access <<item/managing-items#90, the *Images* tab>>.


==== Shipping profiles

Select (icon:check-square[role="blue"]) at least one <<fulfilment/preparing-the-shipment#1000, shipping profile>> per item. Otherwise the shipping costs may not be calculated correctly. No shipping profile is selected by default.
If an order contains items without a shipping profile, then the items will be given <<online-store/setting-up-ceres#260, the default shipping profile for the default online shop>>. If no default shipping profile was specified, then the shipping profile with the highest priority will be used.

==== Online store

[cols="1,3"]
|====
|Setting |Explanation

| *Store special*
|Should this item be highlighted with a <<item/online-store/store-specials#, store special>>?
If so, then specify whether you want the item to be a special offer, a new item or a top item.

| *Item feedback*
|Enter a number between **1** and **5** or **1** and **10** for the initial item feedback. When using the item feedback function, the number entered here will be displayed as the item’s initial rating. Every time new feedback is submitted, an average value will be calculated automatically from these numbers. Go to **Setup » Client » Settings » Feedback » Tab: Item** if you want to change the **Maximum rating**.

////

Open this tab to:

* <<item/introduction/search#400, Search for>> variations within the item data record.
* Apply the <<item/import-export-create/create/mass-processing#100, group function>> to several of the item’s variations.
* Create <<item/import-export-create/create/new-item#400, new variations>> for the item.

[#43]
=== Set

[IMPORTANT]
This tab is only visible for <<item/import-export-create/create/new-item#intable-type, items of the type Set>>.

////
zukunftsmusik - auch hier eine Tabelle mit den Optionen (evtl mit includes machen)
////

Open this tab to:

* <<item/use-cases/combining-products#3500, Add items to a set>>.
* Edit various <<item/use-cases/combining-products#3500, settings for the set>>.

[#45]
=== Multi-Channel

You’ll need to save settings in this tab if you’re preparing items to be sold on marketplaces like <<markets/amazon#, Amazon>>, <<markets/ebay/ebay-setup#, eBay>> or <<markets/neckermann/neckermann-at-setup#, Neckermann.at>>.

[.instruction]
Saving settings for marketplaces:

. Go to *Item » Edit item*.
. <<item/introduction/search#100, Search for>> and open the item.
. Click on the *Multi-Channel* tab in the upper row. This tab is divided into several areas.
. Carry out the settings.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

==== Amazon

These settings are only relevant if you want to <<markets/amazon#, sell on Amazon>>.

include::../../../markets/amazon/_textblocks/instructions/amz-variation-availability.adoc[tag=table]

==== Listing default settings

These settings relate to <<markets/ebay/ebay-setup#5500, listing templates>>.
The basic idea is simple. Rather than individually configuring the settings for every single eBay, Hood or Ricardo offer, you create a template, which includes the typical offer settings.

[cols="1,3"]
|====
|Setting |Explanation

| *Listing template*
|Choose a <<markets/ebay/ebay-setup#5500, previously created listing template>> to link it with this item.

| *Category 1*; +
*Category 2*
|Enter the eBay category IDs for this item. +
*_Use case_*: in the first step, you’ll create listing templates that apply to all categories. Then in the second step, you’ll specify the category ID for each individual item.

| *Store category 1*; +
*Store category 2*
|Enter the eBay store category for this item. +
*_Use case_*: in the first step, you’ll create listing templates that apply to all store categories. Then in the second step, you’ll specify the store category for each individual item.

|====

==== eBay title

Enter the eBay listing’s title here. This links the listing title to the item.

*_Background info_*: Listings are retrieved on an hourly basis.
While being retrieved, the listing is assigned to an item.
<<markets/ebay/ebay-setup#10400, Listings and items are matched>> smoothly if the listing was created with plentymarkets or if the item has the same name as the listing title.

If the item name differs, you can enter the listing title.
This improves the matching accuracy.
This link also makes it possible to import listings that were set up with other tools into plentymarkets and have them automatically assigned to the correct item.

==== Category link

////
Portlet fällt vermutlich weg in die neue Artikel-UI, da Rakuten DE geschlossen ist
////

This setting is only relevant if you sell on Rakuten.
Here you’ll link the item with a Rakuten category.

Either enter the category ID directly into the text field. Or choose a main category from the drop-down list and then use the pop-up window to figure out the category ID.

==== Neckermann.at Enterprise

////
zukunftsmusik - ausführlicher machen
////

These settings are only relevant if you want to <<markets/neckermann/neckermann-at-setup#, sell on Neckermann.at>>.

[#50]
=== Texts

In this tab, you’ll save item texts like a preview text, technical data and keywords.
It’s possible to save the texts in multiple languages, e.g. if you want to sell your products abroad.

[.instruction]
Saving item texts:

. Go to *Item » Edit item*.
. <<item/introduction/search#100, Search for>> and open the item.
. Click on the *Texts* tab in the upper row.
. Choose the appropriate language from the left drop-down list.
. Enter the item texts in this language.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

.Entering item texts
[cols="1,3"]
|====
|Setting |Explanation

| **Language**

|Deletes the texts of whichever language was selected under **Open language**. All text fields are emptied.

| **Name 1; +
Name 2; +
Name 3**
a|Enter the item's name.

* *Name 1* = The item’s default name, which is used in the plentyShop and on marketplaces. +
* *Name 2*; *3* = Alternative item name that can be used for example for markets. +
The maximum length of the item name is 240 characters. The item name is used to build the item URL.

//siehe zwischengespeicherte Callisto-Infos zum Thema SEO - evtl ist etwas hilfreiches dabei, um die Beschreibung hier ausführlicher zu machen


| **Preview text**
|Enter the preview text. The preview text is a short text which can be displayed in item lists. The preview text can be entered in HTML format or as plain text.

| **Item text**
|Enter the item text. The item text is a detailed description displayed in the item layout in the plentyShop.

| **Technical data**
|Enter the item’s technical data.

| **URL path**
|The item's URL path in the plentyShop. By default, the URL path consists of the categories and the item name. plentymarkets automatically assigns the path when the item is created. The path is displayed as part of the URL when the item is viewed in the plentyShop.

| **Meta description**
|Enter a description which is used when searching for the item with search engines (max. 350 characters).

| **Meta keywords**
|Enter keywords to improve search engine performance.

| **Item template**

|====

[#70]
=== Fields

////
zukunftsmusik - die Beschreibungen hier und unter vorbereitende Einstellungen etwas ausführlicher machen
////

Add free text fields to the detailed view of an item. Customers can then enter values into the free text fields, such as an additional request or dimensions.

Once you’ve <<item/settings/free-text-fields#, defined free text fields>>, you’ll activate them here for the appropriate items.

[.instruction]
Activating free text fields:

. Go to *Item » Edit item*.
. <<item/introduction/search#100, Search for>> and open the item.
. Click on the *Fields* tab in the upper row.
. Enter the values into the required free text fields.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

[#80]
=== Characteristics

include::../../_textblocks/config/link-characteristic-to-item.adoc[]

[#90]
=== Images

First, you’ll upload images of the item and its variations here. For example, you could upload images of a t-shirt in red, blue and green.
Then you’ll assign the images to the appropriate variations. This causes customers e.g. to automatically see an image of the green t-shirt when selecting this variation in the plentyShop.

[IMPORTANT]
.100 images can be uploaded per item
====
You can upload up to 100 images per item, i.e. per item ID.
This is a hard limit in the user interface.
If you were to upload e.g. 150 images, then only the first 100 would appear in the user interface.
Note that the limit applies to the entire item, i.e. to all of the variations together.
====

[discrete]
==== Uploading images

. Go to *Item » Edit item*.
. <<item/introduction/search#100, Search for>> and open the item.
. Click on the *Images* tab in the upper row.
. Drag-and-drop images into the appropriate area or click on icon:upload[set=plenty, role=purple] *Select files* and upload the images.
. Carry out the additional settings. Note <<table-upload-item-image>>.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

[TIP]
.Do you want to upload lots of images?
====
<<item/settings/images#, Use an FTP server>> to upload large quantities of images.
====

[[table-upload-item-image]]
.Uploading an item image
[cols="1,3"]
|====
|Setting |Explanation

| *0*
|The first image automatically receives the position number 0. Additional images are then given the position numbers 1, 2, 3 etc.
Enter different position numbers if you want to sort the images in your plentyShop.
Alternatively, click on the symbols icon:chevron-down[role="darkGrey"] *Down* or icon:chevron-up[role="darkGrey"] *Up* to change the order of the images.

| *Availability*
|Which sales channels should this image appear on?
Select (icon:check-square[role="blue"]) the appropriate clients and/or markets.

| *Market attribute link*
|Select an attribute value to link the item image for marketplaces with this attribute value. The image will only be transferred to marketplaces where item variations have this attribute value. +
*_Note_*: This option is only shown if the image is linked with at least one variation.

| *Alternative text; +
Name*
| *_Optional:_* Enter an alternative text and name. Entries in both fields help search engines index the item. Use appropriate keywords in the image names to make the images more relevant to search engines. This also increases traffic on the page, for example if the image is found with the Google image search.

| *Size*
|Displays the image size in pixels and kilo bytes.
|====

[discrete]
===== Technical specifications

[cols="1,3"]
|====

| *File formats*
|The file formats supported for images are: PNG, JPG, GIF, SVG

| *File names*
a|Image file names may contain the following characters:

* Letters (a-z, A-Z) excluding umlauts
* Numbers (0-9)
* Underscores (_)
* Hyphens (-)

Spaces and special characters such as umlauts are not permitted. When you upload images, spaces and special characters are replaced by hyphens (-).

| *Image sizes*
a|Every time an item image is uploaded, plentymarkets creates the following versions:

* High-resolution item image
* Medium-sized item image
* Item attribute image
* Two preview images

Since plentymarkets does not scale up images, the source image must have at least the size and quality specified in the <<item/settings/images#500, Sizes>> area. Larger images will be scaled down to the specified size.
|====

[discrete]
==== Linking images with variations

Once you’ve uploaded the images, you’ll match them with the appropriate variations.
This causes customers e.g. to automatically see an image of a green t-shirt when selecting the green variation in the plentyShop.

[.instruction]
Linking images with variations:

. Go to *Item » Edit item*.
. <<item/introduction/search#100, Search for>> and open the item.
. Click on the *Images* tab in the upper row. +
→ You’ll see a list of all the images saved for the item.
. Select the images (icon:check-square[role="blue"]) that you want to link.
. Click on icon:plus[role="green"] *Variation link*. +
→ A pop-up window will open.
. If needed, use the filters on the left to find specific variations.
. Choose which variations (icon:check-square[role="blue"]) should be linked to these images.
. Click on icon:check[role="green"] *Link*.

[TIP]
.Removing the link again
====
Underneath an image, click on icon:chevron-down[role="darkGrey"] *Variation link* to see which variations were linked to the image.
Select the variations (icon:check-square[role="blue"]) that should no longer be linked and click on icon:exclamation-circle[role="darkGrey"] *Unlink*.
====

[TIP]
.Alternative: upload images in the lower row of tabs
====
Search for and open a variation. Then click on <<item/managing-items#330, Images>> in the lower row of tabs.
Here you can upload an image for the currently opened variation. In other words, the image is simultaneously uploaded and linked to the variation.
====

[#95]
=== Stock

////
zukunftsmusik - includes verwenden, um die inhalte auch hier anzuzeigen
////

In this tab:

* you’ll see an <<stock-management/managing-stocks#400, overview of the item’s stock levels>>. In other words, you’ll see how many copies of each variation are in stock.
* you can <<stock-management/managing-stocks#700, reorder>> items that are running out of stock.
* you can <<stock-management/managing-stocks#500, redistribute stock>>, i.e. move stock to a different storage location.

[#100]
=== Cross-selling

In the <<item/online-store/cross-selling#, Cross-Selling>> tab, you can link items to any number of similar items from your assortment.

[#110]
=== Media

[WARNING]
.Tab is outdated
====
This tab is no longer supported.
Files that you upload in this tab _can not_ be used for the plentyShop.
Instead of uploading files in this tab, <<item/settings/properties#600, create a property>> of the type "File".
====

This tab is only relevant for the outdated Callisto webshop.
Here you can upload files such as product information or brochures.
Your customers can then download these files from the product page or from the "my account" area.
The files that you upload in this tab must meet the following requirements:

* The file must be intended for the old Callisto webshop
* *Permitted file formats:* PDF, EXCEL, X_EXCEL, DOC, DOCX, MSWORD, RTF, TEXT, RICHTEXT, ZIP, HTML, SWF
* *Maximum file size:* 10 MB per file
* *Maximum number of files:* 10 files per item (of which a maximum of 1 file in SWF format)

[#130]
==== Inserting a download link into the online store

Use the template function *GetDocumentLinks()* of the Callisto design to add download links to the files saved in the *Media* tab to the old online store Callisto. This template function can be used in all templates in the *ItemView* folder. The function returns a list of links that customers can use to download the saved documents.

[.instruction]
Inserting the template function:

. Go to *CMS » Web design*.
. Open a template in the *Layout » ItemView* folder.
. Insert the code example into the template.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings. +
→ A list of download links is displayed at the respective position in the online store.

[source,plenty]
----
include::../../assets/EX-EN-GetDocumentLinks.html[]

----
[TIP]
.Limiting the list of download links to specific data types
====
Limit the list of download links to specific data types by specifying a file ending. The template function *GetDocumentLinks(".pdf")*, for example, displays only the download links to saved PDF files.
====

[#140]
=== Statistics

In the tab *Statistics*, you can analyse <<business-decisions/plenty-bi/statistics#90, statistical data about the item>>.
For example, there are statistics that let you analyse the item’s revenue according to various criteria.

[#170]
== Lower row of tabs

Variation data is found in the lower row of tabs.
In other words, the lower row of tabs contains data that applies to _a specific variation_.
Namely, the variation whose ID is currently displayed in the upper tab row.

Keep in mind that the <<item/introduction/structure#600, main variation>> can pass data onto its sub-variations, i.e. they can <<item/introduction/inheritance#, inherit>> its data.
You can deactivate the inheritance function if you would prefer to modify the variations individually.

[#180]
=== Settings

This tab includes a wide range of basic options for the variation.
Here you’ll also find a timestamp, which tells you when the variation was created and when it was last modified.

[.instruction]
Saving settings for the variation:

. Go to *Item » Edit item*.
. <<item/introduction/search#400, Search for>> and open the variation.
. Click on the *Settings* tab in the lower row. This tab is divided into several areas.
. Carry out the settings.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

[#190]
==== Basic settings

[cols="1,3"]
|====
|Setting |Explanation

| *Variation name*
|Enter a name for the main variation.

|[#intable-variation-number]*Variation No.*
|Enter a number for the main variation.

*_Recommendation_*: If you leave this field blank, then plentymarkets will automatically assign the <<item/settings/variation-numbers#, next available variation number>>.
The number will be assigned according to the pattern saved in the menu *Setup » Item » Settings*.

| *External variation ID*
|Enter an external variation ID for the main variation.

*_Use case_*: The external variation number facilitates importing items and variations from an external system.

| *Model*
|Enter a model name for the main variation.

| *Position*
|Enter a position number for the variation.
Variations can be sorted by their position number in the back end and the front end.

*_Back end_*: Search for items in the menu *Item » Edit item*.
Move your mouse cursor over the column header *Position*.
Click on the small triangle (icon:caret-down[role="darkGrey"]) to display the items in ascending or descending order by their position number.

*_Front end_*: Select the appropriate <<welcome/quick-start/quick-start-online-store#120, sorting option in the Ceres assistant>>.

*_Note_*:
Open the Ceres assistant and navigate to *Pagination and sorting » Additional sorting options*.
If the option *Calculate the variation position based on monthly sales* is set to *Yes*, then manually entered position numbers will be overwritten.
|====

[#200]
==== Availability

Ask yourself a few questions. For example:

* Should plentymarkets <<item/managing-items#intable-limitation, monitor the stock of this product>>?
* If the product is out of stock, should customers still be able to <<item/managing-items#intable-client-visible, see it>> or even <<item/managing-items#intable-online-store-available, buy it>> in the plentyShop?
* And if so, should customers only be able to access the product <<item/managing-items#intable-item-list, via the direct URL>>?

Such questions relate to the item availability. In other words, _when_ the variation is visible or purchasable.

Note that there is also the <<item/managing-items#340, Tab: Availability>>, which you’ll use to specify _where_ the variation is available.

[cols="1,3"]
|====
|Setting |Explanation

|[#intable-active]*Active*
|Variations only become visible in the plentyShop or on marketplaces once they have been activated. In other words, you can work on inactive variations without your customers noticing.
Activate the variation (icon:check-square[role="blue"]) when you’re ready for it to go live.

*_Item search_*: inactive variations are _not_ found with the <<item/introduction/search#100, default search settings>>.
Set the search filter *Active* to *No* if you want inactive items to be included in the search results.

2+| *Availability*

|[#intable-symbol]*Symbols 1-10*
|Select the appropriate availability level.

*_Note_*: Which exact delivery time this symbol represents is configured in the <<item/settings/availabilities#, preparatory settings>>.

*_Note_*: The availability is a static setting. That means that the availability level selected does not change irrespective of actual stock levels. The setting is relevant only if stock availability is not set automatically.

a|[#intable-online-store-available]*Show in online store:*

* *Available automatically if net stock is positive*
* *Not available automatically if net stock is 0 or negative*
a| * *Available automatically if net stock is positive* = Select this option if you want the variation to automatically be available and purchasable in the plentyShop if the net stock is positive.
* *Not available automatically if net stock is 0 or negative* = Select this option if you want the variation to automatically be unavailable if it is out of stock.

Both functions complement each other and are only applied if the <<item/managing-items#intable-limitation, Limitation>> option is set to *To net stock*.

2+| *Visibility*

a|[#intable-client-visible]*Client:*

* *Visible automatically if net stock is positive*
* *Invisible automatically if net stock is 0 or negative*
a| * *Visible automatically if net stock is positive* = Select this option if you want the variation to automatically be visible in the plentyShop if the net stock is positive.
* *Invisible automatically if net stock is 0 or negative* = Select this option if you want the variation to automatically be invisible if it is out of stock. When this happens, customers will not be able to access the variation with a <<item/managing-items#intable-item-list, direct URL>> either.

Both functions complement each other and are only applied if the <<item/managing-items#intable-limitation, Limitation>> option is set to *To net stock*.

*_Note_*: These options take priority over the *Item list* options further below.
So if you combine the “Client” and “Item list” options and a variation is out of stock, then customers will not be able to access the variation via the direct URL. Therefore, we recommend that you either control the visibility with the plentyShop visibility or with the item list visibility. We do not recommend combining these settings.

|[#intable-item-list]*Item list*
a| * *Always invisible* = Activate to make the variation invisible in the item list of the plentyShop. When the option is activated, the variation can only be opened using the direct URL to the variation. The variation is not shown in the categories, search results or item lists, i.e. store specials, cross-selling and last seen items. +
* *Visible automatically if net stock is positive* +
*Invisible automatically if net stock is 0 or negative* = Activate to automatically make the variation visible in the item list if the net stock is positive and invisible if the net stock is 0 or negative. Both functions complement each other and are only applied if the *Limitation* option is set to *To net stock*. When the options are activated and no net stock is available for the variation, the variation can only be opened using the direct URL to the variation. The variation is not shown in the categories, search results or item lists, i.e. store specials, cross-selling and last seen items. +

*_Note:_* The options *Client: Visible automatically if net stock is positive* and *Client: Invisible automatically if net stock is 0 or negative* take priority. If these options are activated and a variation is out of stock, then customers will not be able to access the variation via the direct URL. Therefore, we recommend that you either control the visibility with the plentyShop visibility or with the item list visibility. We do not recommend combining these settings.

==== Sales prices

Here you can link <<item/settings/prices#, existing sales prices>> to the variation and enter monetary prices.
The monetary prices can be:

* manually entered for the variation.
* automatically calculated with the help of an <<item/settings/prices#1000, existing price calculation>>.

. Go to *Item » Edit item » [Open variation] » Tab: Settings » Area: Sales prices*.
. Select the previously created <<item/settings/prices#, sales price>> from the left drop-down list.
. Click on *Add* (icon:plus[role="green"]). +
→ The sales price is added and displayed in the list.
. Enter the monetary price into the *Price* field.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

[TIP]
.plentymarkets works with gross prices
====
Behind the scenes, plentymarkets works with gross prices.
Technically, you can use the middle drop-down list to decide whether you want gross prices or net prices to be displayed in the item data record.
But this only affects how the prices are displayed.
_Only_ gross prices are saved internally in the database.
====

[TIP]
.Deleting the link again
====
Open the variation and click on *Delete* (icon:minus-circle[role="red"]) in the line of a sales price.
This deletes the link between the sales price and the variation.
The sales price itself is not deleted.
The sales price is simply removed from the variation.
Afterwards, the sales price will be available in the left drop-down list again.
====

[TIP]
.Inheritance behaviour
====
If <<item/introduction/inheritance#, inheritance>> is active, then combinations of sales price and monetary price will be passed down from the main variation to the sub-variations.
If you want to maintain individual prices for the sub-variations, deactivate the inheritance and then add the sales price.
====

[#250]
==== Barcode

Barcodes such as GTIN, ISBN, UPC and QR are used to identify items in plentymarkets. Link <<item/settings/barcodes#, barcodes>> with your item variations.

[.instruction]
Manually linking barcodes with variations:

. Go to *Item » Edit item*.
. <<item/introduction/search#400, Search for>> and open the variation.
. Click on the *Settings* tab in the lower row.
. In the *Barcode* area, select the <<item/settings/barcodes#100, previously saved barcode configuration>> from the drop-down list.
. Click on *Add* (icon:plus[role="green"]). +
→ The barcode type is added and displayed in the list.
. Enter the code into the *Code* field.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

[TIP]
.Automatically assigning barcodes from the number range
====
If you bought a <<item/settings/barcodes#200, range of GTIN 13 barcodes>>, then plentymarkets can automatically assign the next available barcode to your item.

To do so, proceed as described above. Rather than manually entering the barcode into the *Code* field, click on *Generate GTIN* (icon:execute[set=plenty]).

==== ASIN/ePID/MOIN

[cols="1,3a"]
|====
|ID |Explanation

| *ASIN*
|The "Amazon Standard Identification Number" is a 10-digit, alphanumeric product identification that is provided by <<markets/amazon/amazon-setup#, Amazon>>.
The ASIN and ISBN are identical for books.
The ASIN can be found on Amazon's product page.

| *ePID*
|The "eBay Product ID" is a product identification that is provided by <<markets/ebay/ebay-setup#, eBay>>.
The ePID is provided by eBay.

| *MOIN*
|The "My OTTO Identification Number" is an alphanumeric product identification that is provided by <<markets/otto-market#, OTTO Market>>.
Starting August 11th, 2021, every product on OTTO Market must have a MOIN.

*_Note_*: The MOIN is assigned by OTTO Market.
You do not create it yourself.
If you sell a product on OTTO Market and it's also available through other sellers, then all of the offers will have the same MOIN.
|====

[.instruction]
Manually linking the ASIN, ePID or MOIN with a variation:

. Go to *Item » Edit item » [Open variation] » Tab: Settings » Area: ASIN/ePID/MOIN*.
. Click on *Add* (icon:plus[role="green"]). +
→ A new entry is added to the list.
. Select *ASIN*, *ePID* or *MOIN* from the right drop-down list.
. If needed, select the country platform from the left drop-down list.
. Enter the ASIN, ePID or MOIN into the field.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

[IMPORTANT]
This area is only visible for <<item/use-cases/combining-products#2000, item bundles>>.

Choose settings in this area to have the <<item/managing-items#270, weight>> and <<item/managing-items#280, purchase price>> automatically <<item/use-cases/combining-products#2000, calculated for item bundles>>.

[#267]
==== Item image

Click on the image to access <<item/managing-items#90, the *Images* tab>>.

[#268]
==== Tags

Here you can link the variation to any number of <<welcome/general-functions/tags#, tags>>.

. Click in the text field.
. Select the tag from the drop-down list or enter the first few letters of the tag’s name and then use the auto-complete function.
. The tag will be link to the variation when you save your changes. +
→ Use the <<item/introduction/search#intable-tags, tag filter>> to search for all of the variations that have this tag.

*_Note_*: Here you can only link the tags that were made available for the *Variation* area.

[TIP]
.inheritance behaviour
====
Tags that you link to the main variation are passed on to the item’s other variations. To save other tags for a variation, deactivate inheritance and save different tags.

If you remove all tags from a variation, inheritance is not activated. This behaviour differs from other inheritance settings in the system. Instead, the variation is saved without any tags.

[#270]
==== Dimensions

[cols="1,3"]
|====
|Setting |Explanation

|[#intable-content]*Content*
|Enter the content and select a <<item/settings/units#, unit>> from the drop-down list.

| **Length/Width/Height**
|Enter the variation’s dimensions in millimetres.

| *Gross weight*
|Enter the variation's gross weight in grams or kilograms. This weight includes the packaging for variations that are packaged separately. The value entered here is used to calculate shipping packages and weight-based shipping costs. +

*_Item bundles_*: the gross weight can <<item/use-cases/combining-products#2500, automatically be calculated based on the bundle components>>.

| *Net weight*
|Enter the variation's weight without packaging in grams or kilograms. +

*_Item bundles_*: the net weight can <<item/use-cases/combining-products#2500, automatically be calculated based on the bundle components>>.

| **Units contained**
|Units contained describes several sales units combined in one package. Default setting: **1**. +

*_Note_*: This value does not influence how the <<item/managing-items#intable-unit-price, unit price>> is calculated.

|[#intable-unit-price]*Show unit price*
|Select this option (icon:check-square[role="blue"]) if you want the unit price to be displayed in the plentyShop.

*_Background info_*:
The unit price tells you how much the item costs per pound, litre or other unit of measure.
It’s calculated based on the item’s <<item/settings/units#, unit>>, <<item/managing-items#intable-content, content>> and <<item/managing-items#240, price>>.
The unit price allows consumers to compare prices. In some countries, the unit price must be specified for products that are sold by weight, volume, length or surface area.
|====

[#280]
==== Costs

[TIP]
This data is used to <<item/settings/prices#1000, calculate>> your sales prices.

[cols="1,3"]
|====
|Setting |Explanation

| icon:calculate_acquisition_pricepng[set=plenty] *Acquisition price*
|Click on this button to see the acquisition price in gross and net.
The acquisition price results from the procurement calculation. It is calculated based on the price requested by the supplier minus discounts and bonuses. Plus procurement costs for transportation, insurance and packaging.

| **VAT**
|Select the <<orders/accounting#550, VAT rate>> for the variation.

| *Net purchase price*
|The net purchase price. The purchase price is either calculated automatically or managed manually depending on how the settings were saved in the menu *Setup » Stock » Stock » Incoming items*. +
The net purchase price is used, e.g. for price calculations. +

*_Item bundles_*: the net purchase price can <<item/use-cases/combining-products#2500, automatically be calculated based on the bundle components>>.

| *Moving average purchase price (net)*
|The net moving average purchase price. It is recalculated every time stock is booked in. It is calculated from the purchase prices of all stocks that are available for the variation in the warehouse. +

*_Note_*: Go to *Setup » Stock » Stock » Incoming items* and see which warehouses were activated with the setting *Warehouse for moving average price*. The moving average purchase price only takes items into account that were booked into one of these warehouses. If no warehouse is active, then no moving average purchase price is calculated. +

*_Item bundles_*: the moving average purchase price can <<item/use-cases/combining-products#2500, automatically be calculated based on the bundle components>>.

| **Net transportation costs**
|Enter the net transportation costs for the variation. This value is used for price calculations and for calculating the acquisition price.

| **Net storage costs**
|Enter the net storage costs for the variation.

| **Customs**
|Enter a value in percent for customs.

| *Customs tariff number*
a|Enter the <<orders/accounting#620, customs tariff number>>.
In plentymarkets, it’s possible to save a different customs tariff number for each variation.

*_Example_*: In some countries, children’s clothing is taxed differently depending on the size.
In this case, it makes sense to save the customs tariff number separately for each variation.

*_Inheritance_*: The customs tariff number is automatically <<item/introduction/inheritance#, passed down>> from the main variation to the sub-variations. This means:

* _you don’t need to enter customs tariff numbers_ for your sub-variations if you want them to have the same customs tariff number as the main variation.
* _you’ll need to enter a different customs tariff number_ for all of the sub-variations that should differ from the main variation.

| **Operating costs**
|Enter a value in percent for operating costs.
|====

[#290]
==== Shipping

[cols="1,3"]
|====
|Setting |Explanation

| *Order picking*
a|Specify the type of picking.

* *Empty option* = The order picking type will not be specified.
* *Single order picking possible* = Not currently functional.
* *Single order picking not possible* = Not currently functional.
* *Exclude from pick list* = This option is well-suited, e.g. for variations that do not have barcodes and thus can not be processed with <<orders/order-documents/pick-list#, normal pick lists>>. +
*_Relationship to other settings_*: Do you use the plugin link:https://marketplace.plentymarkets.com/en/eafshipableitemcount_6919[Filter for shippable items]?
Then take a look at the plugin's filter descriptions. Some filters only apply to variations that are excluded/not excluded from the pick list.

| **Main warehouse**
|Select the variation's main warehouse.

| **Pallet type**
|Select the pallet type.

| **Packing units**
|Select the number of packing units and the type of packaging if the item consists of multiple packages. +
Select the value **0** if you always want the item to be shipped in a single package, regardless of the quantity. This setting also applies to various items. This means that all items of an order that have the value **0** will be packed into one package.

| *Extra shipping charge 1; +
Extra shipping charge 2*
a|Enter a fee that should be charged _in addition_ to the normal shipping costs.
Such extra shipping charges are useful for large or bulky items that are particularly expensive to ship.

* Extra shipping charge 1 applies to the first item.
* Extra shipping charge 2 applies to each additional item.

*_Additional settings_*: In each of your <<fulfilment/preparing-the-shipment#1000, shipping profiles>>, specify whether these extra charges should be added to the basic shipping costs.

The manual also includes several <<fulfilment/preparing-the-shipment#1100, example calculations for extra shipping charges>>.
|====

[#300]
=== Categories

<<item/import-export-create/create/new-item#, While creating the variation>>, you already specified which category the variation should be sorted into.
Here in this tab, you can _link additional categories_ to the variation.
The variation will be displayed in all of the selected categories in the plentyShop.

[.instruction]
Linking additional categories:

. Go to *Item » Edit item*.
. <<item/introduction/search#400, Search for>> and open the variation.
. Click on the *Categories* tab in the lower row.

→ The category is linked and displayed in the *Linked categories* area.

[TIP]
.Inheritance behaviour
====
By default, the main variation passes category links on to its sub-variations.
However, you can deactivate the <<item/introduction/inheritance#, inheritance function>> if you want to configure differing settings for a sub-variation.

. Open the sub-variation and click on the tab *Categories*.
. Click on *Deactivate inheritance* (icon:item_variation_inheritance[set=plenty]).
. Configure the category settings for the sub-variation.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

|Setting |Explanation

| *Client (store)*
|If you work with multiple clients, then you will see them displayed here.
You can set the default category for each client individually.

=== Availability

Where do you want to sell this variation? Answer the question by selecting the corresponding marketplaces and plentyShops.

[.instruction]
Choosing sales channels for the variation:

. Go to *Item » Edit item*.
. <<item/introduction/search#400, Search for>> and open the variation.
. Click on the *Availability* tab in the lower row. This tab is divided into several areas.
. Carry out the settings.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

[TIP]
.Additional availability settings
====
Note that there is also the <<item/managing-items#200, Tab: Settings » Area: Availability>>, which you’ll use to specify _when_ the variation should be visible or purchasable.
====

[#350]
==== Markets

Which marketplaces do you want to sell the variation on?

. Click in the text field and select (icon:check-square[role="blue"]) the appropriate marketplaces from the drop-down list.
. Click on *Add* (icon:plus[role="green"]).

[TIP]
.Your market isn’t in the list?
====
The drop-down list only includes active referrers.
So if you can’t find a specific market in the list, then open the menu *Setup » Orders » Order referrer* and make sure the market was activated (icon:check-square[role="blue"]).
====

[TIP]
.The markets do not affect the online store.
====
The markets control the visibility on the marketplaces themselves.
They do not affect the visibility in the plentyShop Ceres.
There is in fact a marketplace called "Store".
However, this was relevant for the old "Callisto" online store.
Nowadays, it's no longer used.

There are a few different settings that control the visibility of an item in the online store.
You can learn more about these settings in our <<item/online-store/checklist-items-visibility#, checklist for item visibility in the online store>>.
====

[#360]
==== Client (store)

With plentymarkets, you can manage several online stores, i.e. <<online-store/setting-up-clients#, several clients>>, with only one software. Consequently, it is possible to manage several different areas of business with one plentymarkets system. That’s a great advantage. But it also means that you’ll always need to tell plentymarkets which online store a variation should appear in.

[.instruction]
Linking a client to the variation:

. Go to *Item » Edit item*.
. <<item/introduction/search#400, Search for>> and open the variation.
. Click on the *Availability* tab.
. Choose whichever store (icon:check-square[role="blue"]) the variation should appear in.
. Save (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.


[TIP]
.Setting is greyed out? Check the stock level!
====
plentymarkets can automatically remove items from the plentyShop if they are no longer in stock.
This automatic process is controlled by the settings in <<item/managing-items#200, Tab: Settings » Area: Availability>>.
More specifically, it’s controlled by the settings *Show in online store: Not available automatically if net stock is 0 or negativ* and *Client: Invisible automatically if net stock is 0 or negative*.

If one of these options is activated and the variation is no longer in stock, then the client setting here will be greyed out.
Reorder the variation to get it back in stock. Alternatively, click on the lock symbol (icon:lock[role="darkGrey"]) if you want to manually make the variation visible in the plentyShop despite the fact that it’s not in stock.

This setting remains valid until new stock is booked for the variation. Once net stock for the variation becomes positive, the availability and visibility settings if net stock is 0 or negative take effect again.
====

[#370]
==== SKU

Here you’ll add market-specific SKUs as needed.

. Click on *Add* (icon:plus[role="green"]). +
→ The *New SKU* window opens.
. Select the referrer and the account if needed. +
*_Note_*: Not every marketplace has an account. In this case, the setting is greyed out.
. Enter the SKU.
. Click on icon:plus[role="green"] *Add*.

[#2090]
=== Notes

In the *Notes* tab, you can save notes about a variation. Notes are only visible in your plentymarkets back end. As such, notes will not be displayed in the plentyShop.

[.instruction]
Saving a note:

. Go to *Item » Edit item*.
. <<item/introduction/search#400, Search for>> and open the variation.
. Click on the *Notes* tab in the lower row.
. Enter the note and format the text.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the note.

[TIP]
.Notes can be deleted
====
If you no longer need a note, then you can remove it by clicking on the delete icon (icon:minus-circle[role="red"]).
====

[TIP]
.Notes are visible in the item overview
====
The <<item/introduction/search#800, symbols in the item overview>> help you quickly see whether a note was saved for the variation.
The symbols are found in the *Procedures* column:

* icon:order_note[set=plenty, role="blue"] = The variation _has a note_.
Click on this symbol to open a pop-up window where you can directly view and manage your notes.
* icon:order_note_create[set=plenty, role="green"] = The variation _does not have a note yet_.
Click on this symbol to open a pop-up window where you can directly save a new note.

Depending on how you configured the <<item/introduction/search#intable-table-type, Table type>> filter, this symbol either refers to the main variation or to a specific sub-variation.
In other words:

* Table type Item = There is only one note symbol per item. This symbol manages notes for the main variation.
* Table type Variations = There’s a separate note symbol for each variation.
