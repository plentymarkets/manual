You decide what the search bar looks like in the plentyShop and which results it delivers.
For example, you can decide:

* Which <<item/online-store/search-bar#60, type of search results>> your customers should see.
** Items that match the search term.
** Categories that match the search term.
* Whether customers should see a <<item/online-store/search-bar#60, list of suggested search terms>> when they enter vague or misspelled text.
** "Did you mean…​"?
* <<item/online-store/search-bar#70, Which item data>> the search term should correspond to, in order for the item to be included in the list of results.
** Item name, description, keywords, etc.

[IMPORTANT]
.Customisable item search for plentyShop LTS
====
It’s possible to customise the front end item search for link:https://marketplace.plentymarkets.com/en/plugins/sales/online-shops/ceres_4697[plentyShop LTS]{nbsp}icon:external-link[].
Lower versions do not support this function.
====

[TIP]
.Partial words also get results!
====
It’s no big deal if your customer only enters part of a word.
The search suggestions give results for prefixes, suffixes and partial words.
For example, the word "Couch" is suggested even if the customer enters "Couc" or "uch".

== Optional: Renaming texts

////

////

You can change the texts in the plentyShop to meet your needs.
For example, you could change the text in the search bar from “Items” to “Products”.

[.instruction]
Renaming texts:

. Go to *CMS » Multilingualism*.
. Choose a source language and a target language from the drop-down lists. +
*_Note_*: You can select the same language from both lists.
. Expand the area *plentyShop LTS » Item search* (icon:chevron-down[role="darkGrey"]).
. Rename the text on the right side. +
*_Example_*: Find the field *ITEMSEARCHPRODUCTS* and change the text from "Items" to "Products".
. *Save* (icon:save[set=plenty, role="green"]) the settings.
. <<welcome/quick-start/quick-start-online-store#270, Deploy the plentyShop LTS plugin>> to apply the changes.

== Optional: Which item data should be considered?

////

once it's been developed, add info that the seller can choose a text property to have a specific variation found under a different term like Blume and Tulpe
////

//tag::boost[]
You decide _which item data_ is relevant to the search function.
During a search, only the item data that you selected will be queried.
You also decide _how heavily weighted_ each piece of item data should be.
The higher the number entered, the higher the item data field will be prioritised in the search result.

[.instruction]
Choosing and prioritising item data:

. Go to *Setup » Item » Search » Frontend » Search settings*.
. Activate the item data fields (icon:toggle-on[role="green"]) that should be included in the search results and search suggestions.
. If needed, enter a value into the *Boost* column.
. *Save* (icon:save[set=plenty, role="green"]) the settings.

[TIP]
.Which boost value should I enter?
====
You can enter any number as a boost value.
The default settings are appropriate in most cases.
These default settings prioritise the variation ID and the item ID.
So if someone searches for a number in your plentyShop, then the search results will give priority to these ID fields.
====

[TIP]
.What’s the difference between search results and search suggestions?
====
* Search results are the items or categories that match the search term.
* Search suggestions are similar words to whatever terms the customer entered.
Search suggestions help customers find what they’re looking for, even if they enter vague or misspelled text.
"Did you mean..."?

*_Note_*: If you activate an item data field for the search suggestions on the right, then the field will automatically be activated for the search results on the left too. Why? Otherwise you would be suggesting customers to use a search term that doesn’t deliver any results.
====
//end::boost[]

== Optional: Changing languages

////

////

//tag::sprachen[]
The search function can be activated for up to three languages.
The languages German, English and French are activated by default.
If you run plentyShops in other languages, you can select different languages.

[IMPORTANT]
.Search index is completely rebuilt after any changes
====
If you change the language settings, the search index is completely rebuilt.
That means that all items are added to the index again from scratch.
Depending on how many items you have, this process can take several days.
====

[.instruction]
Changing the languages:

. Go to *Setup » Item » Search » Frontend » Languages*.
. Activate or deactivate languages as needed (icon:toggle-on[role="blue"]). +
*_Note_*: Only three languages can be activated per system at the same time.
. *Save* (icon:save[set=plenty, role="green"]) the settings. +
→ The items are added to the search index for the activated languages.
