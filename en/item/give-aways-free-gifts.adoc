Use give-aways to generate more revenue in your online store by motivating your customers to buy more items and more frequently. The basic idea is simple: You offer a variation as a give-away when customers reach a defined value of items per order. Instead of adding these give-aways to each order manually, you can use an **<<basics/automation/event-procedures#, event procedure>>** to automatize this process.

You can also add promotional items that you do not want to sell in the online store. To do so, set the variation to **invisible** and link it to an invisible category, i.e. a category that is not activated for the online store.

[TIP]
.Tip: Bonus item scale
====
Use more than one event procedure to offer a bonus item scale. This allows you to offer different variations depending on the value of items customers buy. In the first event procedure, e.g. set the item value filter to **&gt;= 100.00 GBP** and **&lt; 200.00 GBP**. In the second event procedure, set an item value filter of **&gt;= 200.00 GBP** and select a different, more attractive variation.
