I want to update PayPal. How should I proceed?::
    If you want to update the PayPal plugin in a copy of your plugin set, you have to change the back end plugin set that is linked to your user account. For further information on how to change your back end plugin set, refer to the page <<installing-added-plugins#back-end-plugin-set, Installing added plugins>>. After reloading your back end, you can use the assistant normally.
