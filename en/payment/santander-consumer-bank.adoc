After the AKB Privat- und Handelsbank merged with the CC-Bank in Germany, the company began operating under the new name Santander Consumer Bank AG in 2006. The bank focuses on the areas of consumer finance, retail banking and online banking. Santander also specialises in instalment financing. Santander integrates several payment methods in your online store - via one interface only.

Payment process

The customer will be forwarded to a page on the Santander Consumer Bank website after having clicked on the link. The customer has to enter the necessary data for the loan request. Once the customer has entered and confirmed the data, he or she will be forwarded to the order confirmation page.
