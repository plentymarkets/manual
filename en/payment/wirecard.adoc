== Important notes

This chapter provides you with important information about integrating the payment provider in plentymarkets.

[#20]
=== Payment process

The customer is forwarded to Wirecard for the payment process and an iframe prompts the customer to enter his or her necessary data. The payment method is selected in the online store. Afterwards, the customer is forwarded directly to Wirecard and the additional content is made available in an iframe. The customer enters his or her data here. In other words, the data is not entered in the online store, but rather in Wirecard. Once the customer has entered and confirmed the data, he or she will be forwarded to the order confirmation page.

[#30]
=== SSL certificate

You need to have an <<start/plentymarkets-account/service-center/ssl-certificate#, **SSL certificate**  >> in order to correctly use the payment method.

[WARNING]
.Ask your bank
====
Ask your bank whether it can process payments with iframe before you integrate this payment method.
