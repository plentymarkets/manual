**link:http://www.postpay.de/de/p/postpay/postpay.html[POSTPAY, window="_blank"]** (only available in German) is a payment service offered by Deutsche Post. This service provider allows you to offer your customers a payment and order process that is already used by many Deutsche Post customers. POSTPAY offers the payment methods **Direct debit**, **Cash in advance**, **Giropay**, **Sofortbanking**, **Credit card** and **Purchase on invoice**.

== Important notes

This chapter provides you with important information about integrating the payment provider in plentymarkets.

[IMPORTANT]
.Order generation
====
An order is not generated in plentymarkets until the incoming payment is received. In other words, the order is not yet created during the order process when the customer clicks on the **POSTPAY** button in the shopping cart.
====

[.subhead]
Payment process
After confirming the order, the customer will be redirected to the POSTPAY website. The customer logs into his or her POSTPAY account, selects a payment option and confirms the payment. The customer may have to enter his or her invoice and delivery address on POSTPAY. It depends on whether the customer has already gone through the checkout process in your online store and selected POSTPAY as the payment method or whether the customer clicked on the POSTPAY button in the shopping cart without logging in.

Here is an overview of both variations:

* The customer logged into your online store and has already entered the invoice and delivery address. This data will automatically be entered when the customer is forwarded to POSTPAY. However, the customer can still change this data if desired.
* The customer has not logged into your online store and clicks on the POSTPAY button in the shopping cart. The customer is forwarded to POSTPAY where he or she can log in using the POSTPAY data. The primary payment method and the address are already saved there. The purchase can be completed with only one click. If the customer does not already have a POSTPAY account, he or she has to enter the invoice and delivery addresses here.

== Registering with POSTPAY

If you already have an **link:https://de.allyouneed.com/de/customerlogin.html[Allyouneed.com, window="_blank"]** seller contract, you do not need to register again. You can directly begin to **<<payment/postpay#30, set up POSTPAY >>**.

If you do not have a contract yet, register with link:https://de.allyouneed.com/de/dealer/page/selfsignup/step1?ssu=postpay[**POSTPAY**, window="_blank"] (German only). Afterwards you will receive the Allyouneed.com &amp; POSTPAY seller contract by post or by email. Sign the contract and send it back. Add information about the beneficial owner and the legal representative. Your account will be activated once it was checked by POSTPAY. You will receive an email confirmation that includes your access data. You need the access data to set up the interface in plentymarkets.

|Setting |Explanation

|**User name**
|Enter the user name that you received from POSTPAY.

|**Password**
|Enter the password that you received from POSTPAY.

|**Activate test mode**
