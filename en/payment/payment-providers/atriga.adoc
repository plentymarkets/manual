== atriga conditions for plentymarkets

plentymarkets customers don't have to make any advance debt collection payments and they don't incur any costs in the case of failure. They receive 100% payment in the case of success. You can get information about any detail of your debt collection processes around the clock. This information can either be made available online with the DebitManager, email, and/or RSS feed. Your debtor's SCHUFA credit check* is included free of charge in atriga's link:http://gateway.atriga.com/dls/services/?DID=400002000[debt collection process^]. The report provides you with a solid assessment of how your debtor is doing financially.

[.subhead]
The atriga guarantee

With atriga debt collection, no additional costs will be incurred afterwards – regardless of success or failure. If the total debt claim is paid, then you will receive 100% of your main and accessory claims including interest rates. That is why you can immediately make use of professional help, also for small invoice amounts, without risking any costs. +
With the help of the SCHUFA-declaration (credit insurance agency)*, atriga will customise the debt collection process according to the economic situation of your debtor. This way atriga ensures that all measures that can balance your pending debt claims will be taken. If possible, these measures include e.g.: dunning letters that will be individually discussed with you and could also be sent via email, fax or text message, reporting the payment history of your debtor to the SCHUFA*, skilled atriga employees and lawyers will contact the debtor by telephone, a personal visit to the debtor is possible and at last legal dunning procedures can be taken.

[.subhead]
Dunning procedure plus

If you should decide to take legal action in carrying out the dunning procedure then, with a good debtor credit rating, you will only incur costs for external advance payments (e.g. court fees, marshal's fees), which you would have to pay in advance anyway until the debtor has paid these back.

== Registering with atriga

Go to the atriga link:http://dm.atriga.de/[DebitManager™^] to register online for free and without any obligation.  +

atriga transfers money to your account as soon as a debtor has paid. If possible, they transfer your money the same day. However, atriga can only transfer money to you if they have information about an authorised bank account. Provide atriga with this information before you have finished the activation process. This authorised account is saved under your bank details in your DebitManager™.

== Setting up the interface to atriga

The interface is divided into 2 sections. Not only is it possible to activate debt collection by atriga, but it is also possible to activate the credit rating atrigapaymax.

[#40]
=== Setting up atriga debt collection

You will need your authentication code from atriga for setting up the interface. The authentication code can be found in the back end of your DebitManager™. The query for the XML interface has to be activated in order for atriga to create and display the authentication code. Carry out the following settings in plentymarkets after having copied the authentication code.

[.instruction]
Setting up the interface to atriga debt collection:

. Go to *Setup » Client » Select client » Services » atriga*.
. Insert the copied *authentication code*.

→ For example, 5555 from the customer number a-DE.0005555.
. *Save* the settings.

[IMPORTANT]
.Finding the customer ID
====
The customer ID is part of your atriga customer number starting with the first number greater than 0. You can find the customer number in the so-called *InfoPanel* in the DebitManager™. For example, enter 123456 into plentymarkets if your customer number is a-DE.00123456.

[cols="1,3"]
|====
| Setting  | Explanation

|*Validation method*
|*Retrospective credit rating* = Customers agree to the credit check before it is carried out. Customers who do not agree to the credit check will not be able to use the payment methods invoice, debit and credit card. You need to make a few changes to your design for the credit check. In the <<payment/payment-providers/atriga#120, PageDesignPrepareMainColumn>> template, the template variables *AtrigaRequireUserConfirmation* and *AtrigaShowValidationError* must be set.

|*Minimum shopping cart value*
| Enter a monetary amount. The customer's credit will be checked for purchases that equal or exceed this amount. If you do not enter anything, then the customer's credit will be checked for purchases starting from 0 EUR.

|*Maximum shopping cart value*
| Enter a monetary amount. The customer's credit will be checked for purchases that equal or are below this amount. If the shopping cart value is greater than the value entered here, then the customer's credit will not be checked and the customer will not be able to use the payment methods invoice, debit and credit card. This entry is optional.

|*Differing delivery address*
| Decide whether you want to permit a differing delivery address for the 3 payment methods that require the customer's credit to be checked. +
*permitted to invoice address only* = A different delivery address will not be permitted. +
*delivery permitted to separate delivery address* = A different delivery address will be permitted.

|*Permitted payment methods based on credit rating*
| Select which payment methods should be visible for every credit rating result. +
*Green* = The payment method will be visible to customers who receive a green credit rating. +
*Yellow* = The payment method will be visible to customers who receive a yellow credit rating. +

|====

[.subhead]
Payment method cannot be changed after it is selected

If atrigapaymax is activated, then registered customers will not be able to change an order's payment method in their account. The payment method cannot even be changed if the option *Permit changes to orders retroactively* is set to *Yes* in the *Setup » Client » Select client » Order process » Settings* menu.

[.subhead]
Customers receive a negative rating if the credit check fails

Customers will receive a negative, i.e. red, credit rating if the credit check fails. Access the <<basics/data-exchange/api-log#, API log>> to see whether a credit check has failed. The credit check failed if an error is listed in the response from atrigapaymax. The customer's credit will be checked again the next time that they make a purchase.

[#60]
== Changing the validity of the checkout URL

Debt collection service providers such as atriga receive a URL for the order overview of the order for which the dunning procedure was initiated. You will receive an error message if this URL is not valid for a long enough time, e.g. if it is only valid for 7 days. (Example: "Code: 111 The order information can no longer be retrieved with this address. Please access the order information by logging into your account with your email address and password."). In this case, increase the validity:

[.instruction]
Changing the validity:

. Go to *Setup » Client » Select client » My Account » Settings*.
. Select a higher value for the option *Validity of checkout URL*.
. *Save* the settings.

[#70]
== Transferring orders

You can transfer orders to a debt collection service manually or automatically.

. Select one or more orders by placing check marks.
. Click on *Group function*.
. Place a check mark next to the option *Transmit to atriga (debt collection)*.

== Resetting an order that was not transferred correctly

An order is blocked once it is transferred to atriga. It cannot be transferred again. An exception is made if the first transfer was not successful, e.g. because the address was incorrect. In this case, you can reset this order specifically and transfer it again correctly.

[.instruction]
Resetting an order:

. Go to *Orders » Handover for debt collection*.
. Select one or more orders.
. Click on *Reset orders*. +
→ You can transfer the order again.

[#110"]
== Notifying atriga if you receive payment for a previously transferred order

If an order has already been transferred to atriga, then information about any subsequently received payments will not be communicated to atriga. Unfortunately, the atriga interface does not provide a way to do this. In this case, notify atriga directly that the order was paid for.

[#120"]
== Customising the design for credit rating

With the template variables *AtrigaRequireUserConfirmation* and *AtrigaShowValidationError* you can integrate a checkbox which allows your customer to accept a credit rating.
