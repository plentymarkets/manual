With the PayPal plugin, you integrate the PayPal payment methods in your online shop and make them available to your customers. To do so, download the PayPal plugin from the link:https://marketplace.plentymarkets.com/en/payone_5434[plentyMarketplace^]{nbsp}icon:external-link[]. Setup of the payment method is done with an assistant. You also have to carry out a few basic settings in your plentymarkets system so that the payment methods are activated in your system. +
The explanations in this section apply after adding the plugin. You can find more information on adding and installing plugins in the <<plugins#, Plugins>> section of the manual.

[#10]
== Requirement: Opening a PayPal business account

To work with PayPal, you first need a PayPal business account. You get information as well as login details when you open the account. Without these, the plugin cannot be set up and is not usable. If you don’t have one yet, open a link:https://www.paypal.com/de/business[PayPal business acount^]{nbsp}icon:external-link[] first.

== Completing the assistant

[IMPORTANT]
.Activating the plugin set in the main client
====
For account linking and the functionality of event procedures, the PayPal plugin has to be activated in the plugin set used for the main client. Since there is a dependency on the IO plugin, IO must be active for the deployment process (saving the plugin set).

.*Information about address validation*
--

The PayPal assistant contains the option *Address validation* in the section *Order processing*. This validation is _automatically activated_. You have to select to deactivate the validation. You can either deactivate the validation for selected or for all countries. To do so, check (icon:check-square[role="blue"]) the countries for which addresses are not to be validated. +
If the payment should also be executed with an incomplete address you should deactivate the address validation.

The default validation is a PayPal requirement. The validation checks if there is a complete address. It is not validated whether this is an actually existing address. The payment is only executed successfully if there is a complete address. +
The PayPal address validation is important for the coverage when shipping goods. Moreover, PayPal offers buyer and customer protection, which is especially important when orders are processed with PayPal Express. In this case, the address is transmitted by PayPal itself.

== Linking template containers

[IMPORTANT]
.Information about linking containers

====

You have different options how to integrate PayPal PLUS, the PayPal Express Checkout button and the Banners for PayPal Installments in your online shop. To do this, the plentymarkets system offers containers at relevant places which can be filled with content to meet your needs.

. Go to *Plugins » Plugin set overview*.
. Open the plugin set you want to edit.
. Open the plugin *PayPal*.
. Click on *Container links*.
. From the drop-down list, select the data provider you want to link.

|Content |Explanation

2+| *General*

| *PayPal Checkout Scripts*
|The container *Checkout: After scripts loaded* has to be linked.

| *PayPal Confirmation Scripts*
|The container *Script loader: After scripts loaded* has to be linked.

| *PayPal Express Button Scripts*
|The container *Script loader: After scripts loaded* has to be linked.

|*PayPal Styles*
|	The container *Template: style* has to be linked to activate the styles required by PayPal and to offer optimal functionality.

|*PayPal Express Checkout button*
|Optional: The PayPal Express Checkout button can be individually placed, e.g. next to the shopping cart.  By clicking on this button, customers can purchase the content of the shopping cart immediately without going through the regular checkout. Instead, the customer is immediately forwarded to the PayPal payment process. The shipping address is provided by PayPal.

|*Banners for PayPal Installments*
|Optional: The Banners for PayPal Installments can be placed in many different ways to promote this payment method. You can choose between a graphic banner (PayPal Installment Graphical Promotion Banner) and a text banner (PayPal Installment Text Promotion Banner). A separate integration is not necessary. In the assistant, the banners can automatically be linked to an item page, the cart or the checkout. Additionally, the banners are also available to you as widgets in the ShopBuilder. Thus, they can be placed where they are needed, e.g. on landing pages, item pages, the shopping cart or the checkout.

|*PayPal Reinitialize Payment / PayPal PLUS Reinitialize Payment*
|A link with the container *My account: Additional payment information* allows the customer to reinitialise the payment in the *My account* area after an unsuccessful transaction. For PayPal, the *Order now* button is displayed, for PayPal PLUS, the Wall is displayed. +

2+| *PayPal PLUS*

| *PayPal PLUS Wall*
|A link with the container *Checkout: Override payment method* replaces all previous payment methods with the PayPal PLUS Wall.  Any payment methods offered in addition to those included in the Wall – PayPal, Debit, Credit card and Payment upon invoice – are displayed below these four inside the wall in the order of their priority. +
In the assistant, different options how to display the PayPal PLUS Wall are available: *Wall replaces the payment list*, *Wall within the payment list* or *Wall in an overlay during the purchase*. +
Also pay attention to <<payment/payment-plugins/paypal#50, Additional information about the PayPal PLUS Wall>>. Additional information as well as restrictions are described there.

|====

[#50]
=== Additional information about the PayPal PLUS Wall

Apart from the PayPal PLUS payment methods, 10 further payment methods can be shown in the checkout within the PayPal PLUS Wall. +
For Germany, for example, the payment methods Debit, Credit card and Invoice are possible. With this, a maximum of 14 payment methods can be shown in the checkout.
But if, for example, only PayPal and Credit card are allowed for a certain delivery country, the maximum number is restricted to 12.

Moreover, PayPal PLUS limits the number of characters for the names of the other payment methods. The maximum number of characters is limited to 25.  If a name has more than 25 characters, it is truncated. +
Note that special characters, e.g. an umlaut, reduces the number of characters, because they are read out in HTML-style.

PayPal states the following:

* max. image size of 100 x 25 px +
* max. 25 characters for *methodName* +
* max. 120 characters for *description*

==== I am using Ceres and the PayPal Plugin. What am I to do if I am not redirected to plentymarkets after I activated my PayPal account?

Please check first whether the <<plugins/updating-installed-plugins#, latest PayPal plugin version>> is installed and deployed in your plentymarkets system.

[WARNING]
.Activation and preview of the plugin
====
Make sure that the PayPal plugin is already activated and deployed in the Plugin-Set of the main client when you are linking your account with plentymarkets. If this is not the case, malfunctions can occur. +

Attention: The plugin-set preview must _not_ be open while the PayPal account is linked with plentymarkets.
====

.Redirection to plentymarkets is not possible
image::_best-practices/auftragsabwicklung/Payment/assets/PP-Plugin_Fehler_1.png[Plugin Fehlermeldung 1]

[%interactive]
* *Solution 1*: Change the browser and try again. plentymarkets supports the browsers Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox.
* *Solution 2*: There is still an active API right in the PayPal account. Remove the rights for plentymarkets. Die API-Berechtigung ist unter folgender URL zu finden: link:https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_profile-api-list-auths[]{nbsp}icon:external-link[].

[WARNING]
.NOTE
====
With removing the API rights, all linked PayPal accounts are disconnected from your plentymarkets system. In case a PayPal account is linked with the market *eBay*, this account has to be linked with the PayPal interface again.
