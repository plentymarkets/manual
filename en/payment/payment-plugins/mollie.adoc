With the Mollie plugin, you integrate the Mollie payment methods in your online shop and make them available to your customers. To do so, download the Mollie plugin from the link:https://marketplace.plentymarkets.com/en/mollie_6272[plentyMarketplace^]{nbsp}icon:external-link[]. Setup of the payment method is done with an assistant. You also have to carry out a few basic settings in your plentymarkets system so that the payment method is activated in your system. +
The explanations in this section apply after adding the plugin. You can find more information on adding and installing plugins in the <<plugins#, Plugins>> section of the manual.

== Requirement: Registering with Mollie

To use Mollie, you need a Mollie account and the login data. Without these, the plugin cannot be set up and is not usable. If you don’t have a Mollie account yet, link:https://www.mollie.com/dashboard/signup/5543454?lang=de[register first^]{nbsp}icon:external-link[] .

== Completing the assistant

:name-assistant: Mollie
:name-payment-method: Mollie

include::../../_includes/textblocks/instructions/completing-assistant-payment-method.adoc[]

[IMPORTANT]
.Completing the assistant again
====
In some cases, you have to complete the assistant again. If you deactivate a Mollie payment method, which is activated in your plentymarkets system, directly via the dashboard in your Mollie account after you have already completed the assistant, you have to complete it again. If you run it again, the settings will match and cannot lead to a misconfiguration.

.*Single-click payments*
--

With the function Single-click payments, your customers can save their credit card details directly with Mollie by creating a Mollie customer account. This way, they don't have to enter their payment details every time they buy something and payment processing is faster. If you want to make this function available to your customers, you have to activate it in the assistant. +
If you have activated Single-click payments, you can see which of your customers use this function. In this case, a unique ID assigned by Mollie is saved in the corresponding contact data set in plentymarkets. In addition, the customers who use Single-click payments are also listed in your Mollie account.

== Setting up event procedures

To send all the necessary data to Mollie, 3 separate event procedures are needed. These events are the shipping of the order items, cancellations of orders and the creation of refunds. Mollie needs to be informed if any of these are initiated. Proceed as described in the next chapters to set up the event procedures.

Additionally to the three necessary event procedures *Registering shipment*, *Registering cancellation* and *Registering refund*, which are used to send important data to Mollie, the event *Mollie | Payment failed* is also available for use. It is an optional event, though. You could use it to determine how orders for which payments are failed are to be handled.

=== Registering shipment with Mollie

:table-event-procedure: <<table-procedure-mollie-shipment>>

This event procedure can also be used for delivery orders. The delivery order is then registered with Mollie as a partial shipment.

[#90]
=== Registering refunds with Mollie

If you create a credit note order for an order which was paid with Mollie, Mollie has to be informed about this. Make sure that the order items which are to be refunded are contained in the credit note order. You can find more information about credit note orders in general in the chapter <<orders/managing-orders#500, Working with credit note orders>> of the manual.

[TIP]
.E-Mail-Versand
====
We recommend to connect the registration of a refund with the status change of an order as an event.

Following the procedure *Mollie | Register refund*, two additional events are available to illustrate the further process of the order: *Mollie refund failed* and *Mollie refund successful*.   You can optionally set up event procedures with these events in the same way as described above.
