With the Mollie plugin, you integrate the Mollie payment methods in your online shop and make them available to your customers. To do so, download the Mollie plugin from the link:https://marketplace.plentymarkets.com/en/mollie_6272[plentyMarketplace^]{nbsp}icon:external-link[]. Setup of the payment method is done with an assistant. You also have to carry out a few basic settings in your plentymarkets system so that the payment method is activated in your system. +
The explanations in this section apply after adding the plugin. You can find more information on adding and installing plugins in the <<plugins#, Plugins>> section of the manual.

== Requirement: Registering with Mollie

To use Mollie, you need a Mollie account and the login data. Without these, the plugin cannot be set up and is not usable. If you don’t have a Mollie account yet, link:https://www.mollie.com/dashboard/signup/5543454?lang=de[register first^]{nbsp}icon:external-link[] .

== Completing the assistant

:name-payment-method: Mollie

include::../_textblocks/completing-assistant.adoc[]

[IMPORTANT]
.Completing the assistant again
====
In some cases, you have to complete the assistant again. If you deactivate a Mollie payment method, which is activated in your plentymarkets system, directly via the dashboard in your Mollie account after you have already completed the assistant, you have to complete it again. If you run it again, the settings will match and cannot lead to a misconfiguration.
