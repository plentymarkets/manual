== Saving the customer's bank details

You can save the customer's bank details in the *Settings* tab of a customer's data record or delete them again as needed. Bank details are needed, e.g. for the payment method <<payment/managing-payment-methods#40, debit>>. There is also an <<payment/managing-payments#10, import function>> for bank details in plentymarkets. Contact a legal adviser for information about the current laws in your own country as well as in other countries of delivery.

[IMPORTANT]
.Pay attention to subscription orders
====
Note that the bank details saved here will also be used for subscription orders with the payment method *Debit*. If you delete bank details that are connected to such a subscription order, then the payment method in the <<orders/scheduler#, scheduler>> will be changed to the <<payment/managing-payment-methods#25, default payment method>> for the particular client (store). The subscription order will then no longer be paid for as an automatic bank transfer. In such a case, only delete the bank details if absolutely necessary. If possible, save new bank details for the customer.

== Setting up SEPA direct debit mandate

As part of the SEPA initiative (Single Euro Payments Area), euro payments were standardized in Germany and 35 other European countries on February 1st, 2014. Bank transfers and direct debits can now only be carried out with IBAN and BIC. You can <<payment/managing-bank-details#67, migrate>> your customers' bank details automatically in the plentymarkets system. There are different types of direct debits:

* *SEPA core direct debit* → Allows a biller to collect funds from a payer's account, provided that a signed mandate has been granted by the payer to the biller
* *SEPA business to business direct debit* → Enables business customers in the role of payers to make payments by direct debit

Business to business direct debits are only permitted between companies (B2B) and they require a separate mandate. You need to receive a SEPA direct debit mandate from your customers. This replaces the previous direct debit authorisation. This mandate is the new legal authorisation for using SEPA direct debit to withdraw funds from another account.

[#230]
=== Creating a document template

Go to *Setup » Orders » Documents* and click on the *SEPA direct debit mandate* submenu. There is a template for configuring the SEPA direct debit mandate. For further information about documents, refer to the <<orders/order-documents#, Document templates>> page of the manual.
