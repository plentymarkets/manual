Instructions for setup are also in the plentyMarketplace or in the manual section <<payment/payment-plugins#, Payment plugins>>. +
On this page, you will find information on how to manage payment methods and which settings to select.  Moreover, you will find an overview of <<payment/managing-payment-methods#65, payment methods in your plentymarkets system>> as well as an overview of <<payment/managing-payment-methods#70, marketplace payment methods>>.

== Specifying the default payment method

Proceed as follows to specify the payment method to be set by default in the order process in your online shop.

[.instruction]
Specifying the default payment method:

. Go to *Setup » Client » [Select client] » Orders*.
. Select a payment method from the *Default payment method* drop-down list.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

[#30]
== Permitting the payment method in a customer class

You need to permit payment methods in the basic settings of your customer classes. These settings also relate to the *standard end customers*. New payment methods need to be added to the list of permitted payment methods. Vice versa, you can exclude payment methods from this list to prevent the payment methods from being used by a particular customer class. After having set up a new payment method in your system, check the settings under *Permitted payment methods* for each of your customer classes. For further information, refer to the <<crm/managing-contacts#15, Creating a customer class>> page.

[TIP]
.SSL certificate and encryption
====
We generally recommend that you use <<business-decisions/system-administration/domains#, SSL encryption>> for your online shop if you work with payment data and customer data. This is required for payment methods that work with an iframe.

[#50]
== Offering a discount based on a payment method

You can offer your customers a discount when they use a specific payment method. This is a customer class setting which enables you to offer a discount on payment methods in the online shop. For information on how to set this up, refer to the chapter <<crm/managing-contacts#28, Setting up a discount based on the method of payment>> of the manual.

[#60]
==  Shipping without payment

Some payment methods require items to be shipped before the payment was received, e.g. with payment on invoice. If the <<stock-management/managing-stocks#, stock>> is limited to net stock, then the system will check whether stock is available and will set the corresponding order in status 4 or 5. To apply this setting, go to <<orders/basic-settings#, Setup » Orders » Settings>> and select *YES* for the option *Status changes to 4 instead of 5 if stock is missing*. If you select *NO* for this setting, no stock limitation is set. The order will then be directly cleared for shipping and set to order status 5.

The following payment methods require shipping before payment:

*  Invoice
*  Debit
*  Cash on delivery
*  Amazon

For further information, refer to the <<stock-management/managing-stocks#, Stocks>> page of the manual.

[#65]
== Overview of payment methods in the system

You can find an overview of all payment methods and their IDs in your plentymarkets system in the *Setup » Orders » Payment » Methods* menu. By default, the plugin payment methods are displayed. If you want to see all the existing system payment methods, use the toggle (icon:toggle-on[role="green"]) above the table.

In this overview, payment methods cannot be activated. If you want to integrate a payment methods into your plentymarkets system and thus make it available for your customers, you have to download the corresponding plugin from the link:https://marketplace.plentymarkets.com/en/plugins/payment[plentyMarketplace^]. Instructions for setup are also in the plentyMarketplace or in the manual section <<payment/payment-plugins#, Payment plugins>>.
