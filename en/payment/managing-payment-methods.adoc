Learn how to set up this discount on the <<crm/managing-contacts#28, Discount based on the payment method>> page. Besides, enter information about *early payment discount* and *valuta* directly in the <<crm/managing-contacts#300, data record of a customer>>.

[[table-overview-non-contract-payment-methods]]
.overview of non-contract payment methods
[cols="1,3"]
|====
|Payment method |Explanation

|*Pay upon pickup*
|Use this payment method to allow your customers paying cash when picking up an item. Then, manually book the incoming payment in your system. Assign the payment to an order afterwards.

|*Cash sale / cash card*
|Use the *Cash sale / cash card* payment method, e.g. with your plentymarkets POS system in your stationary retail store, enabling your customers to pay cash or with cash card. Incoming payments will be transmitted from the cash card terminal or the POS system to your plentymarkets back end.

|*Credit card*
|The buyer transmits their credit card data to the seller, e.g. in the online store. The item is shipped as soon as the payment is received. +
*_Important_*: For data protection reasons, the payment method *credit card (manual processing)* cannot be used in a plentymarkets online store. Use a different payment method in your online store or use an individual solution for your customers.

|*Debit*
|The seller receives the bank details from the buyer and is allowed to collect the amount due from the bank account of the buyer. You can offer a payment method globally or for <<crm/managing-contacts#300, certain customers only>>. +
*_Important_*: Customers are able to cancel debits at their banks.

|*Cash on delivery*
|The buyer pays for the item upon receipt. The delivery person collects the payment and writes a receipt. +
*_Important_*: A fee is charged for cash on delivery orders.

|*Invoice*
|With this payment method, the customer can order an item via invoice. Payment is made after the item has been received. To pay for the item, the customer receives an <<omni-channel/online-store/standard/documents/invoice#, invoice document>> with the bank details of the seller. Incoming payments have to be <<payment/managing-payments#30, imported>> and assigned to orders in the plentymarkets system. You can offer a payment method globally or for <<crm/managing-contacts#300, certain customers only>>. For further information about this payment method, refer to <<payment/managing-payment-methods#55, Carrying out settings for the purchase on invoice>>.

|*Cash in advance*
|In this case, the buyer receives a message with the order data and the seller's bank details. After the buyer has paid for the item, the payment must be <<payment/managing-payments#30, imported>> into your plentymarkets system. Then, the items will be delivered. Learn how to make your bank data available to your customers on the <<payment/managing-bank-details#, Providing bank data>> page.

==  Shipping without payment

Some payment methods require items to be shipped before the payment was received, e.g. with payment on invoice. If the <<stock-management/managing-stocks#, stock>> is limited to net stock, then the system will check whether stock is available and will set the corresponding order in status 4 or 5. To solve this, go to <<orders/basic-settings#, System » System settings » Orders » Settings>> and select *YES* for the option *Status changes to 4 instead of 5 if stock is missing*. If there is no limitation set up for the stock, then the order will be placed directly in status 5.

The following payment methods require shipping before payment:

*  Invoice
*  Debit
*  Cash on delivery
*  Amazon
*  Credit card (manual processing)
*  Coupon
*  RatePAY invoice
*  MeinPaket payments
*  Hitmeister payment
*  PAYONE cash on delivery
*  PAYONE invoice

For further information, refer to the <<stock-management/managing-stocks#, Stocks>> page of the manual.

== Payment methods for markets

Payment methods for markets are payment methods which are necessary to flag incoming payments from integrated markets. In general, the market payment methods do not have to be completely set up. They only have to be activated. Not activating the payment method can cause problems during payment processing. Learn how to activate the payment methods for markets on the respective markets' pages. <<table-overview-payment-method-markets>> provides an overview.

[#80]
== Rounding differences

Some payment providers require you to specify the item quantity per stock unit as well as the unit price rounded to exactly 2 decimal places. If items are *discounted*, then this can lead to discrepancies in the way that plentymarkets and the payment provider calculate the total. Discrepancies frequently occur for large quantities of items with low prices per stock unit. In such cases, the payment provider will calculate the discount per item and then multiply it by the entire quantity of items. In plentymarkets, the discount is applied to the total value of items. <<table-rounding-differences-discounts>> provides you with an overview of how a 5 percent discount is calculated for large quantities of items. It shows you which rounding differences are caused if the discount is calculated per item (payment provider) and if the discount is calculated for the total value of items (plentymarkets).

[[table-rounding-differences-discounts]]
.rounding differences for discounts
[cols="1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3"]
|====
|Quantity |Unit +
price |Total +
price |Unit price minus 5% discount |Discounted unit price, rounded |Payment +
provider |Total price minus 5% discount |Discounted total price, rounded |plentymarkets

|*10*
|2.25
|22.50
|2.25 - 0.1125 = 2.1375
|2.14
|21.40
|22.50 - 1.125 = 21.375
|21.38
|

|*15*
|3.75
|56.25
|3.75 - 0.1875 = 3.5625
|3.56
|53.40
|56.25 - 1.875 = 53.4375
|53.44

|
|
|
|*Total:*
|*74.80*
|*Total:* *74.8125* (basis for plentymarkets)
|*Total:*
|*74.81*
|====

In this case, the total difference is 1 cent. If only the first item were counted, then the difference would be 2 cents. If only the second item were counted, then the difference would be 4 cents.

[WARNING]
.Transaction refused
====
Such differences, even though they are minor, can cause the payment provider to refuse the transaction.
====

[TIP]
.Offering other payment providers or item bundles
====
If you encounter such problems, you can offer alternative payment providers who do not have this problem or that you contact the payment provider to discuss a solution. You can also avoid this phenomenon by offering <<item/managing-items#920, item bundles>> for those items that typically cause rounding differences (items with low prices).
