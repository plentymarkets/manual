==  The statistics module

The **statistics module** makes it possible for you to analyze different parameters of your plentymarkets system and display them in a clear and meaningful chart. At a glance, this gives you a good overview of what is going on in your plentymarkets system and how much growth there has been in your webshop. Besides the analysis of revenues, processes and stock, you can also create your own statistics regarding e.g. leads or messages sent.

Select a **type of statistic** and click on the **save icon** to actually generate the statistic.

[IMPORTANT]
.
====
**Type of statistic**
====

Once you have created a particular **type of statistic**, you can not change it to a different type. If necessary, delete the statistic and create a different type.

==  Editing a statistic

You can **edit** a statistic by clicking on the **pencil icon** to the right of the title bar.

The following table contains explanations of the most important options for the statistics. More detailed explanations can be found on the pages that correspond to individual statistics.

[TIP]
.Tip
====
**Values used for comparing statistics**
====

If you want to **compare** several statistics, e.g. compare the revenue that was generated on various markets, then make sure that you select the same settings when creating these statistics. For example, the **time span** and the **range of statuses** should be the same for all of the statistics that you want to compare.

[cols="a,a"]
|====
| Entry/Setting | Explanation

|**Name**
| Shows the **name** of the statistic that was entered when the statistic was created. You can change the name here.

|**Time span**
| Each type of statistic has a default setting for **time span**. You can see the default values in table 1. You can choose from a number of predefined time spans in a drop-down menu. In addition for some types of statistics you have the possibility to enter a time span by entering a **start and end date**. +
**Change** the **time span** if no data or little data is shown and then click on the save icon to see the result. Choosing a **larger time span** will give you more information. If there is a lot of data, then a **shorter time span** may make more sense in order to be able to actually interpret the graphic.

|**Status options**
| Depending on the type of statistic there are different options available to narrow down the **status**. There are standard values set by default.

|**Multishop**
| Select the **webshops** or **multishops** that you would like to include into the statistic.

|**Raw data export**
| You can export up to **10,000 rows of data**. If you exceed this amount, then only the first 10,000 rows will be exported. In this case, you should use the filter options, e.g. the time span, to limit the amount of data that is exported.
|====

__Table 2: **editing a statistic**; options__

==  Data export

You can use the statistic's export icons (see image 3, top middle) to export the data from the statistic into a **CSV file**. You can then edit the file with a spreadsheet program, e.g. Excel.

Please be aware of a peculiarity when working with **Excel**. Incorrect values may be displayed depending on how the separators are configured. The following image shows an example of this. This example relates to Excel 2007 on Windows.

image::start/assets/EN-Start-Statistik-04-SI.png[]

__Image 4: **exporting a statistic;** incorrect value__

Carry out the following settings to correct this error:

__Image 5: **exporting a statistic;** Excel settings__

**Configuring the separator options:**

.  Go to **Settings / Advanced**.
.  Remove the check mark next to the option **Use system separators**.
.  Enter a **period** as the **decimal separator** (see image 5).
.  Click on **OK** to save the setting.
.  Use Excel to open the particular **CSV file** again.

The incorrect value should now be fixed:

==  Statistic layouts

There are several different **types of diagrams** that you can use for **displaying** your statistics. These will be briefly explained below. The diagram types available depend a little on the type of statistic, but there are always 2 or 3 different ones available. Which layout makes sense for you depends on the combination of your relevant statistical data.

[TIP]
.Tip
====
**Varying diagram types**
====

Try out which **diagram type** best works for each statistic and choose the settings that get the best result. Pay attention to the selected **time span** as well (see tips in section 2).

[IMPORTANT]
.
====
**Showing information**
====

Depending on which diagram type was selected, certain **information** about the graphic will be shown as a **mouseover** (see image 4, red arrow).

Stacked column chart

__Image 7: diagram types; **stacked column chart**__

[IMPORTANT]
.
====
**Information colors**
====

The information displayed as a mouseover (see image 4) is given in the color that corresponds to the statistical value. This makes it possible to distinguish the different values even if there are a lot of small values next to one another.

====
**Moving pie pieces**
====

Clicking on a **pie piece** will move this piece a little outwards. This can help you get a better look at small pieces. Clicking on the piece again will move it back into the pie.

Zoom function

You can **enlarge** the window of a statistic by clicking on the **zoom icon**. Within the zoom window you have further options:

*  You can choose a **time span** from the time line scroll bar.
*  You can show **values** with the mouseover function.
*  You can display or hide certain **parameters** (in the footer). In the image these parameters are e.g. the **number of sales orders** and the **revenue**.

image::start/assets/EN-ENG-Statistik-Allgemein-10-SI.png[]

__Image 10: **zoom function**__

**Displaying a statistic enlarged with the zoom function:**

*  Click on the **zoom icon** (see image 7, arrow) to see the statistic **enlarged** and with further **details**.
*  Clicking on **show all** will remove the limitations and reset the layout so it includes the entire time span again.

Totals

**Totals** are displayed in the data table. They are shown underneath each of the individual columns. There you will see the **column's total value** (see image 8, red arrow) as well as the **column's average value** (see image 8, blue arrow).

[WARNING]
.
====
**Totals are displayed for the entire statistic**
====

If the data table spans **several** different pages, then the totals will be calculated for the **entire table** and not simply for the page that is currently visible.

image::start/assets/EN-ENG-Statistik-Allgemein-11-SI.png[]

__Image 11: **displaying the totals**__

==  Amounts

This section provides you with information about the different types of monetary **amounts** that are used in the statistics.

**Net** = Amount minus VAT +
**Gross** = Amount including VAT +
**Adjusted revenue** = Revenue minus credit notes +
**Contribution margin I** = Revenue minus the purchase price, taxes and shipping costs +
**Contribution margin II** = Revenue minus the purchase price, taxes, shipping costs and any additional costs that were selected

==  Creating specific statistics

[TIP]
.Tip
====
Not only can you analyze a statistic's fixed parameters, but you can also analyze several parameters that are not directly displayed but are still included in the statistic.
====

For example, the **Returns** statistic includes the parameters **Returns** (quantity), **Revenue** and **Reason for return**. These parameters are also analyzed, e.g. in regards to specific **markets**. This makes it possible to isolate and display individual parameters that are not displayed by default. For example, if you want to create a statistic to analyze the returns for a specific market or even for several markets, then proceed as described below. We will show you an example of how you can analyze returns from the market **Amazon**.

**Creating a statistic for returns from the market Amazon:**

.  Create the **Returns** statistic.
.  Select the desired **time span**.
.  Select the **status range**.
.  Select the market **Amazon**.
.  Add Amazon to the **name** of the statistic so that you can recognize what the statistic relates to.
.  Click on the **save icon** to save the settings.
.  If required, create further statistics for other markets.

You can use this procedure to create individual statistics that are customized to meet your needs.
