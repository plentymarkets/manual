==  Memory capacity and traffic

Each plentymarkets system comes with enough **memory capacity** and **traffic** to manage day-to-day business operations. Traffic is generated every time a customer visits your online store, clicks on various items, clicks on images to enlarge them, downloads files, etc.

Additional traffic is generated if you are registered with various **markets** e.g. Yatego, Amazon, eBay, etc.

**SOAP calls** also generate additional traffic, since they create connections to the server. Depending on the type of call, they may generate a substantial amount of traffic. You should optimize your calls, e.g. so that you do not retrieve all of the information, but rather only the changes.

[IMPORTANT]
.
====
For further information about SOAP calls, refer to the **SOAP API / link::/[Troubleshooting]** page of the manual. There you will find information about the **SOAP log**.
====

Even more traffic is generated if your website is "scanned" by so-called **bots** (Info: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_crawler). Bots do the following: They look at your website and save it (content download = traffic). For example, a Google bot does this so that Google can find items from your store along with their descriptions. Bots are controlled by their own algorithms, which makes it impossible to predict when they will visit your website.

If your **collection of items** has expanded (meaning more images etc.) and more bots have discovered your page, then there will also be a higher amount of traffic.

You can check this by going to **Settings &gt; Client (store) &gt; Global settings &gt; Statistics** and looking at your **Webalizer statistics**.

In this menu, you will see your required **memory capacity**, the amount of **traffic** used as well as an overview of the available **data records** for items, auctions, sales orders and customers in your plentymarkets system. The number of items and traffic included in your system varies depending on the contract that was agreed upon. This means that you will be billed if you happen to exceed the amount of memory available to you. You can use this overview to help keep track of these parameters.

If you want to minimize the amount of **robots** accessing your website, then you can block them with the **robots.txt file**.

[WARNING]

The "robots.txt" file is **not a 100% guarantee**! +
For further information about robots, refer to: link:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robots_exclusion_standard[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robots_exclusion_standard] +
Pay attention to these points in order to avoid unnecessary traffic.
