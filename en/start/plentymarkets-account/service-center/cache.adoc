==  Cache function

The **static content** of your online store, e.g **item images**, are stored in the **cache** for a certain amount of time. This makes it possible to display such content as quickly as possible. If you make changes, e.g. to an image, then these changes will not go into effect immediately. Rather, they will only become visible once a certain amount of time has passed. It may take up to one hour.

Take a look at our link:https://www.plentymarkets.co.uk/blog/Im-Rollout-Mehr-Geschwindigkeit-bei-durchgehender-SSL-Verschluesselung/b-1207/[**blog entry**] about this topic (only available in German).

==  Deactivating the cache temporarily

Additionally, you can deactivate your system's cache for a limited period of time. Select the start and the end of your deactivated cache from the drop-down menu. Once you have selected a time in the drop-down menu **From**, you will be able to select a subsequent time from the drop-down menu **To**.

==  Permanent SSL redirect

If you booked an SSL certificate, then your website will be completely encoded. The technology (SNI/TLS) is a common standard that has been used for years. It is supported by all current browsers. However, some of your visitors may use older browsers that do not support this standard. If you deactivate the SSL redirect, then visitors with older browsers will also be able to click through your online store. However, customers will only be able to place an order with current browsers. The sales order process is always encoded, even if the SSL redirect was deactivated. You can inform customers here that it is only possible to place an order with current browsers.
