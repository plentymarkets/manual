In the menu **Start » plentymarkets account » Service center » Tab: Your agency**, you can grant up to two plentymarkets certified service providers access to specific areas of your system. As such, you allow a design agency and/or a consultant to carry out the following tasks in your plentymarkets system:

* Your service provider can delete the cache or temporarily deactivate the cache whilst working on the design in order to work more efficiently.
