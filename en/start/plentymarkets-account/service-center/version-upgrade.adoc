plentymarkets is continuously being developed and optimized. Usually, a new beta and stable version are released each week and your system is automatically updated. We publish a changelog for every new version so that you can always keep track of the changes. The changelogs can be found in the plentymarkets Forum. This also includes important notes about the new version, e.g. ToDos. In some cases, adjustments may have to be carried out manually or settings may have to be checked and tested after upgrading from one version to another. Your current version of plentymarkets is displayed at the top left in your plentymarkets backend.
