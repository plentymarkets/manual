== Content of this page

This page provides information about SSL certificates. You will find out how to check for the expiration date of your SSL certificate and how to order a new SSL certificate or deactivate your active SSL certificate if necessary.

== Information about SSL certificates

An __**SSL certificate**__ is used to __**encode**__ your website. It also provides a __**secure connection**__ to your website and online store. An SSL certificate is required for certain __**markets**__ and for receiving the __**Trusted Shops**__ certification. Your customers can easily see when you are using an SSL certificate as your website will then be accessed via __**https**__.

An SSL certificate is valid for **__at least one year__**. It is **__not renewed automatically__**. Therefore, you need to access the **plentymarkets Service Center** and order a new SSL certificate before your old certificate expires. You always order a new certificate. This means that even if you already own an SSL certificate that is about to expire, you still select a certificate provider and duration from scratch. plentymarkets will place the order on your behalf with the certificate provider you choose and will bill you for the purchase price. There will be no monthly fee for using SSL.

You order the SSL certificate for your **<<start/plentymarkets-account/service-center/domain#, main domain  >>**, i.e. the one that you set as the main domain in the **<<start/plentymarkets-account/service-center/domain#, Start » plentymarkets account » Service Center » Tab: Domain  >>** menu. If you want to use an SSL certificate for a different domain, you will have to set this domain as your main domain first.

[IMPORTANT]
.No SSL certificates for canceled domains or test domains
====
You cannot order SSL certificates for canceled domains or for start-up / test domains, i.e. domains with names that contain **plenty-testdrive.eu**, **plentymarkets-x1.com** etc. For this reason, the **Order SSL certificate** button is not displayed for these types of domains.
====

== Expiration date of your SSL certificate

You can check the expiration date of your SSL certificate and order a new SSL certificate in the <<start/plentymarkets-account/service-center/domain#, **Domain**  >> tab of your plentymarkets Service center.
// Vor Ablauf Ihres SSL-Zertifikats erhalten Sie außerdem eine E-Mail von plentymarkets, die Sie über das bevorstehende Ablaufdatum informiert.

A new certificate becomes valid immediately or, if the certificate provider carries out some quality controls, within about 24 hours. You cannot select a later starting date for the certificate's validity. This means that the certificate becomes valid as soon as the certificate provider confirms your order.

== Ordering a new SSL certificate

Before you order, check that the E-mail address **__hostmaster@yourDomain__** is set up in your system and that E-mails to this address are not forwarded to the plentymarkets support. Then proceed as described below to order a new SSL certificate.

[IMPORTANT]
.Setting up the E-mail address hostmaster@yourDomain
====
Before ordering, set up the <<crm/sending-emails#, **E-mail address**  >>__**hostmaster@yourDomain**__. During the order process, you will receive one E-mail from plentymarkets and another from the SSL certificate provider at this address. +
If this E-mail address is already set up in your system, you need to check that E-mails sent to it are not <<crm/sending-emails#, **forwarded**  >> to the E-mail address __**support@plentymarkets.com**__. Deactivate any forwarding to make sure that you receive the E-mails yourself.
====

[.instruction]
Ordering a new SSL certificate:

. Go to **Start » plentymarkets account » Service center » Tab: Domain**.
. Click on the **blue plus icon** to open your __**main domain**__.
. Click on **Order SSL certificate**. +
→ If your current SSL certificate is valid for at least another 21 days, you will be prompted to confirm that you want to proceed with your order. Confirm your selection if you want to order a new certificate ahead of time.
. Click on **Continue order** in the window **Confirm SSL certificate**.

[NOTE]
.Do not log out of the Service center
====
Do not log out of the plentymarkets Service center during the order process. Stay logged in until you have completed the order process and received and confirmed both E-mails.
====

plentymarkets will now send an **__E-mail__** to your E-mail address __**hostmaster@yourDomain**__. Read the information it contains and then click on the link **Confirm SSL order**. If your current SSL certificate is valid for at least another 21 days, you will again be prompted to confirm that you want to proceed with your order. Confirm your selection if you want to order a new certificate ahead of time.

The available SSL certification bodies and durations are now displayed. Decide which certificate you want to order and then proceed as described below.

[.instruction]
Selecting the SSL certificate provider and duration:

. Click on the **Order now** button for the SSL certificate you want to buy. +
→ The certificate provider sends an E-mail to your E-mail address __**hostmaster@yourDomain**__.
. Read the information in this E-mail and then click on the link it contains. You will be directed to the confirmation page of the certificate provider.
. Check the information displayed on this page and then confirm your order by clicking on the relevant button. +
→ Your order is complete. If the certificate provider does not carry out any quality controls (see note below), then the validity details of your new SSL certificate are displayed in the **Domain** tab of the Service center after about 10 minutes.

[IMPORTANT]
.Quality control measures by the certificate provider
====
In some cases, the certificate provider will carry out some quality controls before it activates the SSL certificate. Therefore, you should always read the confirmation message displayed on the screen closely. These quality controls usually take up to 24 hours. If the status has not changed to "Done" after 24 hours in the plentymarkets Service center, create a new topic in the plentymarkets forum and include your domain details.
====

== Deactivating the SSL certificate

You can deactivate an active SSL certificate temporarily or permanently. To do so, proceed as follows.

[.instruction]
Deactivating the SSL certificate:

. Go to **Start » plentymarkets account » Service center » Tab: Domain**.
. Click on the **blue plus icon** to open your __**main domain**__.
. Click on the **Deactivate SSL certificate** button. +
→ Your SSL certificate will be deactivated.

You can reactivate your SSL certificate at any time by clicking on the **Activate SSL certificate** button. It can take up to 4 hours for the SSL certificate to be deactivated or activated.

[TIP]
.Expiration date remains the same
====
The total validity period of your SSL certificate is not extended when it is temporarily deactivated.
====

== External domain or external SSL

A domain can be hosted externally. The **external domain** then needs to be forwarded to us via A resource record (forwarding of the IP address).

The **SSL certificate** needs to be saved close to the system. This means even if the domain is hosted externally, the actual encoding is done directly in the system after the domain forwarding via IP address was carried out. For security reasons, it is not possible to use an external SSL certificate. The SSL certificate needs to be ordered from us.
