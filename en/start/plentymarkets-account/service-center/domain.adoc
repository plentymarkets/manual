== Information about domains

The following table includes explanations of the various domain types:

[cols="a,a,a,a,a"]
|====
|Type |Additional information |Example name |TLD |Explanation

|Domain
|---
|yourstore
|.com
|The word "domain" refers to an Internet address in the form of a name and an extension, i.e. the top level domain. The name can be chosen freely. A domain is unique, i.e. the exact same domain may never be used twice. Therefore, when registering a desired domain, e.g. with a hosting service provider, it is necessary to check whether the domain has already been used.

|Subdomain
|info.
|yourstore
|.com
|It is possible to create as many subdomains as desired for a domain. Subdomains do not need to be registered. Subdomains use variations of the domain name. They are either placed in front of or behind the domain name and they are separated from it with a period.

|Additional domains
|---
|your-store  +
your_store
|.com
|You can create additional domains that have slightly different names than the main domain. They forward to the main domain so that it can be found, e.g. even if an alternate spelling was used. The additional domain **your-store.com** could be useful for the example above. This would allow the main domain **yourstore.com** to be accessed even if a hyphen was used in the spelling. The names and top level domains can be chosen freely for additional domains. Every additional domain receives the main domain's IP address.

== New domains in plentymarkets

This chapter teaches you how to order new domains, how to create new external domains or subdomains and how to delete a subdomain.

[WARNING]
.Availability after the initial setup or changes
====
It can take up to 24 hours until all of the settings are available on all systems. If settings were changed after 4 p.m., then they will not be processed until after 4 p.m. the following day. If settings were changed on the weekend, then they will not be processed until after 4 p.m. the following Monday. It can take up to 12 hours to process these changes.
====

=== Ordering a new domain

Proceed as described below to order a new domain.

[.instruction]
Ordering a new domain:

. Go to **Start » plentymarkets account » Service center » Tab: Domain**.
. Click on **Order a new domain**.
. Enter the desired domain name.
. Select the top level domain (TLD) from the drop-down menu, e.g. **co.uk** or **com**.
. Click on **Check**.  +
→ The system will check whether the domain is available.

You will receive information about how much it costs to use the domain per month. Enter the contact details (domain handle) and assign the corresponding plentymarkets system. Then order the domain by clicking on **Place order**.

[IMPORTANT]
.Registering .com domains
====
You will receive an email when registering a .com domain. This email will ask you to confirm the WHOIS data that was entered. This email is sent to the email address that was entered under ADMIN-C in the handle data (WHOIS). If you did not receive an email, check whether this email address is available and working.
====

=== Relocating a domain

If the domain is already available, then you can relocate it. To do so, proceed as described in the chapter **Ordering a new domain**. Follow the instructions in the menu.

[.instruction]
Important information about relocating a domain:

* Please have your previous provider's authentication code ready as you will need to enter it.
* The processing times may vary depending on the Top Level Domain.
* **.de** domains: up to 24 hours
* **.com** and **.net** domains: 3 to 7 days
* **.eu** domains: up to 5 days

* You will receive an email if you relocate a **.com** or **.net** domain. The email will ask you to confirm the relocation. This email is sent to the email address that was entered under ADMIN-C in the handle data (WHOIS). If you did not receive an email, check whether this email address is available and working. If the email address no longer exists, then ask your current domain provider to change the email address.

=== Creating a new external domain

Use the option **Create a new external domain** to link an existing external domain to the desired plentymarkets system. The domain's IP address will then be displayed in the overview of domains. Save the IPv4 in the DNS zone (A-Record) of the hosting service provider. If there is an IPv6 A-Record in your externally managed domain, then remove it.

=== Creating a new subdomain

You can create as many subdomains as you want for a domain. You do not need to register these subdomains. For example, if you have the domain **yourstore.com**, then you could create the subdomain **info.yourstore.com** to provide special information about your online store with this domain. Use the drop-down menu to select which main domain you want to link with the subdomain. Select the corresponding plentymarkets system as well.

[IMPORTANT]
.Availability and updates
====
It can take up to 24 hours for new domains or changes to become available. This is because the servers need to be restarted periodically and the data is not distributed in the cloud immediately.
====

=== Deleting a subdomain

You can delete a subdomain. To do so, proceed as follows.

[.instruction]
Deleting a subdomain:

. Go to **Start » plentymarkets account » Service center » Tab: Domain**.
. Click on the **blue plus** icon next to the subdomain that you want to delete.  +
→ Data will be displayed for the selected subdomain.
. Click on **Delete a subdomain**.  +
→ The subdomain will be deleted from the system.

== Carrying out domain settings

Different areas will be available depending on your system configuration. In some cases, you may only be able to see the settings in these areas but not edit them.

=== Domain handle

Save the contact data for the domain owner here.

[.instruction]
Saving contact details:

. Click on **Domain handle**.
. Save the contact data for the domain owner in the window that is displayed.
. Click on the **save icon** to save the settings.

=== Canceling a domain

Proceed as described below to cancel a domain.

[.instruction]
Canceling the domain:

. Click on **Cancel domain**.
. Click on **Yes** in the confirmation window in order to cancel your domain.  +
→ The end of the contract is displayed in a new window.

[WARNING]
.Canceling the main domain
====
Only cancel your main domain if you also want to cancel your plentymarkets system's contract. Otherwise you will have to save a new main domain.  +
If you want to cancel your system's contract, also pay attention to our cancellation deadlines. If you cancel your main domain too early, the domain's contract might well end earlier than the system's contract. The system will no longer be available in this case, even though the contract has not ended yet.
====

[WARNING]
.Canceling a client (store)
====
If you cancel a client (store), the domains associated with this client are also canceled. To continue using these domains, link them to a different client.
====

=== Current DNS settings

In this area of the Service Center, you can view the DNS settings of your domain. DNS is short for Domain Name System. DNS makes it possible for your customers to enter the domain name instead of the numerical IP address of your online store.

==== Updating DNS settings for external domain providers

If your domain is hosted by an external provider, you need to save the DNS settings of your plentymarkets system with your external domain provider. Proceed as described below to view the DNS settings that need to be saved with the external provider.

[.instruction]
Viewing DNS settings:

. Go to **Start » plentymarkets account » Service center » Tab: Domain**.
. Click on the blue plus icon next to the domain to view the DNS settings.
. The table **Current DNS settings** shows the DNS settings.

Checking the DNS:

. Click on **DNS check**.  +
→ The information is displayed in a new window.

**MX** stands for Mail Exchange Resource Record. <<start/plentymarkets-account/service-center/domain#3-5, **Mail server** >> parameters that are available for receiving and sending emails.

=== Name server

Displays the currently used Domain Name Server (DNS).

[#130]
=== Mail server

The mail servers that are available for receiving and sending emails. You do not need to carry out any additional settings if you use the plentymarkets mail server. If you use your own server, then save the values for the IP address as well as MX10 through MX40 if available. The server MX10 takes priority over MX20. In other words, emails are first sent to mail server MX10. If it is not available, then they will be sent to mail server MX20. The lower the MX number, the higher its priority. You should save at least two mail servers to ensure that the availability is never compromised. For example, if a server is down or needs to be maintained, then it will still be possible to receive emails with the other one.

The mailbox.org mail server is selected by default when you order a new domain. The plentymarkets mail server is not available for external domains or domains with external system links.

[.instruction]
Saving the mail server:

. Go to **Start » plentymarkets account » Service center » Tab: Domain**.
. Click on the **blue plus** icon next to the domain that you want to save a mail server for.
. Select the option **plentymarkets mail server** or **Own mail server** from the **Mail server** drop-down menu.
. If you use your own mail server, then pay attention to the explanations given in table 2.
. Click on **Save mail server** to save the settings.

[IMPORTANT]

=== Linking a system

Here you can link the domain to a plentymarkets system or you can edit an existing system link. If you set up multiple domains, then you can select which one should be used as the main domain for each plentymarkets client. The URL will then be displayed in the browser's address line. This is even true for the other domains. It may take up to 24 hours until all of the settings or changes are available on all systems.

[WARNING]
.Switching the main domain
====
If you switch the main domain, then change the URL accordingly on all platforms and in the interface settings in your plentymarkets system, e.g. in the settings for payment providers.  +
Furthermore, go to <<payment/managing-bank-details#70., **Settings » Orders » Payment » EBICS** >> and save the data there once again, in order to update the basic settings.
====

[WARNING]
.Linking a external system
====
The plentymarkets system cannot be linked to an external server if the domain is a main domain. In this case, save a different domain as the main domain before proceeding.
====

[.instruction]
Linking a plentymarkets system:

. Select the plentymarkets system that you want to link the domain to.
. If you use your own server, then select the setting **external server**.
. Enter the server's IP address (A-Record).
. Click on the **Save system link** button.

=== Domain auth code

You need to have an authentication code for your domain if you switch to a different <<start/plentymarkets-account/service-center/domain#3-10, **provider** >>. This auth code proves that you own the domain. You can generate the auth code in this area.

[.instruction]
Generating the domain auth code:

. Click on **Generate domain auth code** in order to generate the authentication code.  +
→ The code will be generated and displayed in the **Domain auth code** line.

[IMPORTANT]
.Validity of the domain auth code
====
A domain auth code is valid for 30 days. If you do not use the code during this time, then you will have to generate a new code after the 30 days.
====

=== CNAME Resource Record

A Canonical Name or CNAME record is a type of DNS record that links an alias name to another canonical domain name (Source: http://support.google.com/a/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=112037). For example, you can use it along with the provider **Shopgate** to create a mobile version of your online store or you can use it to set up an external email service. In the example, the source __**mobile.your-shop.com**__ is the mobile version of the domain __**your-shop.com**__. Use the Shopgate subdomain __**cname.shopgate.com**__ as the target (image 1). This CNAME entry ensures that your store will have the correct resolution with Shopgate.

image::start/plentymarkets-account/service-center/assets/EN-Service-Center-Domain-01.png[]

__Image 1: entering the CNAME__

=== TXT Record

Use the TXT Resource Record to save a user-definable text within a DNS zone. This can be done for your main domain as well as for all sub-domains of your online store. For example, email or newsletter service providers may require such entries. You will receive the texts to be entered here directly from your service provider.

[#200]
=== Saving name servers for sub-domains

In the **Name server for sub-domains** area, enter one or more name servers for a sub-domain.

* Name servers can be saved for sub-domains of a main domain only.
* Enter more than one name server separated by commas.
* Enter the name server's domain name.

Save a name server for sub-domains e.g. to send Newsletter2Go newsletters from an link:https://www.newsletter2go.co.uk/features/newsletter-dispatch-dedicated-ips/[**exclusive, dedicated IP address**, window="_blank"] to optimise delivery rates. If you have booked this Newsletter2Go service, enter the Newsletter2Go name server as the target server. You will receive the necessary information regarding sub-domains and name server from Newsletter2Go.

Proceed as described below to save a name server for a sub-domain.

[.instruction]
Saving name servers for sub-domains:

. Go to **Start » plentymarkets account » Service center » Tab: Domain**.
. Click on the **blue plus** icon of the main domain.
. In the **Name server for sub-domains** area, enter the sub-domain in the **Sub-domain** field.
. Enter the domain name of the target server in the **Target** field. Separate several domain names by commas.
. **Save** the settings.

=== Domain transfer

If you want to switch to a different webhosting provider, then you will need to carry out a domain name transfer (also known as a KK or auth info procedure in Germany). You need to fill out a standardized form of authorization in order for the domain to be transferred. The German form is called a connectivity coordination application, abbreviated as a KK-Antrag. The connectivity coordination application regulates the switch from one provider to another. The auth info procedure is becoming more and more popular.

Please note the following points when switching to a different web hosting provider:

* Generate an <<start/plentymarkets-account/service-center/domain#3-7, **auth code** >>.
* Do not delete your previous domain name with your current provider.
* Tell your current provider about your plans to transfer the domain and let them know that they will soon receive an authorization form.
* Contact the new provider in regards to the transfer. Your new provider will ask you to sign a form and confirm that you want to transfer the domain.

It is usually possible to transfer the domain without any problems. The process can be completed in a short amount of time. However, if you have any problems with the domain transfer because of incomplete or unclear data, then your old provider may initially reject the transfer. In such a case, contact the old provider as soon as possible. The current provider can only accept the transfer once there are no further uncertainties.

[TIP]
.IPS tag
====
If you want to transfer your **.uk** or **co.uk** domain to us from a different domain provider, you need to have your current domain provider adapt the IPS tag in advance. The IPS tag of our domain provider is:

**UNITEDDOMAINS-DE**
====

=== URL forwarding

The **URL forwarding** area allows you to set up forwarding for an extra charge. Proceed as described below to set up forwarding.

[.instruction]
Setting up URL forwarding:

. Go to **Start » plentymarkets account » Service center » Tab: Domain**.
. Click on the **blue plus** icon next to the domain that you want to forward from.
. Click on the **URL forwarding instructions**.
. Read the information that is displayed.
. Pay attention to the instructions and enter the forwarding information into the designated field.
. Click on **Save URL forwarding**.
