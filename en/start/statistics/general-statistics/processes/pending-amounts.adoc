==  1) Info: pending amounts according to payment methods

Pending amounts are shown according to their **payment method** and **dunning level (0 - 4)**. You can precisely define which sales order statuses should be taken into account. Default setting of the **status section**: from **status 1** to **status 7**.

==  2) Details about the statistic

The total **pending amount** and **dunning level** will be displayed for each individual **payment method**. You can limit the information included in the statistic by selecting a specific **status range**. If no pending amounts are available for a particular payment method, then this payment method will not be displayed. The total pending amount that corresponds to each dunning level will be displayed as **mouseover information** for a particular payment method. Each dunning level is displayed in a different color (see image 1). In this statistic you can see, e.g. which **payment methods** currently have the largest **pending amounts** and the highest **dunning levels**.
