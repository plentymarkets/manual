== 1) Info: status of the current orders

This statistic shows the current orders according to the **order status**. It displays the **number of orders** and the **gross revenue in Euro** for each order status. The individual order statuses can be clearly defined by choosing a **start** and an **end status**.

== 2) Details about the statistic

The **number of orders** and the **revenue in Euro** will be displayed for each **order status**. If no orders are available for a particular status, then the point **0** will be displayed on the line graph and no column will be displayed behind it. The **amount in Euro** and the **number of orders** will be displayed as **mouseover information** for a particular order status (see image 1). This statistic gives you an idea of how your orders are distributed among the different statuses. For example, you can easily recognize how many orders have not yet been paid for.
