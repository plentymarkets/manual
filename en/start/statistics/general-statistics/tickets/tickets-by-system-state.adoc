==  Info: tickets by system state

Displays the **tickets according to their system state** during a specific time span. The system states are displayed for the **type of ticket** that was selected. Default setting for the time span: **The last 6 months**. The particular system state is automatically assigned to a ticket and can not be changed. The system states are:

* **Created** = the ticket has been received.
* **Pending** = the ticket is currently being edited.
* **Closed** = the ticket is no longer being edited. It has been completed.

==  Details about the statistic

The **number of tickets** will be displayed for the selected **time period**. The tickets are grouped according to **system state**. The number of tickets and the corresponding **system state** will be displayed as **information in a mouseover**. Furthermore, a second color displays the exact **time period**, during which the corresponding tickets were received or edited (see image 1). If no tickets are available for a specific system state, then this system state will be displayed along with the **number 0**. In this statistic, you can select a specific **type of ticket** and see how many of these tickets are in a particular system state.
