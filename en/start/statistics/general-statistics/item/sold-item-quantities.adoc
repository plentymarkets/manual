== 1) Info: sold item quantities

This statistic shows the **number of items sold** within the selected time span and the **percentage of revenue** that was generated by these sales. Furthermore, the items are grouped into specific **sales ranges**, which you can change according to your needs. In addition the **total number of all items sold** within one sales range will be shown. Default settings of the time span: **the last half a year** and default setting of the sales ranges: **&lt; 1**, **2-5**, **6-10**, **11-15**, **&gt;20**.

[IMPORTANT]
.**Sold quantities**
====
The sold item quantities are grouped together into what we will call **sales ranges**.
====

== 2) Details about the statistic

Each item is grouped into a different **sales range** depending on how many times it was sold within the selected **time span**. Furthermore, the **total number of sold items** and the **percentage of total revenue** is displayed for each **sales range**. If no items were sold within a specific sales range, then the point **0** will be displayed on the line graph and no column will be displayed behind it. The **percentage of total revenue** and the corresponding **number of items sold** will be displayed as **mouseover information** (see image 1). In this statistic you can see, e.g. how many items were sold in each sales range and what percentage of the revenue each sales range generated.

[NOTE]

Explanations of the options

|Entry/Setting |Explanation

|
|Diagram view

|**Type of diagram**
|In this drop-down menu, you can choose how you want the statistics to be displayed. +
**Column and line chart** = Displays the values as columns and lines +
**Data table** = An overview of the data in table format

|**Export**
|The data for this diagram is exported in a **CSV file**. The file contains the same parameters as are displayed with the **Data table** diagram.

|**Raw data export**
|The raw data export also generates a **CSV file**. However, the file contains a more detailed set of data. For example, instead of simply indicating the number of sales orders that were generated on a specific day, the CSV file includes relevant data fields for each individual sales order, such as the **sales order ID**, **price** etc.

|Settings

|**Name**
|Shows the **name** of the statistic that was entered when the statistic was created. You can change the name here.

|**Time span**
|Each type of statistic has a default setting for **time span** that you can see in table 1 on the <<start/statistics#, **Statistics**  >> page of the manual. You can choose from a number of predefined time spans in a drop-down menu. In addition for some types of statistics you have the possibility to enter a time span by entering a **start and end date**.

|
|**Change** the **time span** if no or only very few data is shown and then click on the save icon to see the result. Choosing a **larger time span** will give you more information. If there is a lot of data, then a **shorter time span** may make more sense in order to be able to actually interpret the graphic.

|**Starting date ... Ending date**
|You can enter a specific **starting and ending date** here instead of selecting a **time span** (optional).

|**Multishop**
|Select the **webshops** or **multishops** that you would like to include into the statistic.

|**Sales order referrer**
|Here you can select one or more **item referrers**. You can also use the option **All** to select all of the available item referrers at once.

|**Payment method**
|**Select** which **payment method** should be included in the statistic or use the option **All** to include all of the payment methods.

|**Shipping profile**
|**Select** which **shipping profile** should be included in the statistic or use the option **All** to include all of the shipping profiles.

|**Partition**
|Here you can save the values that you want to use for the different **sales ranges**. Enter the highest value that you want to use for each time period. The lowest value will automatically be calculated by adding 1 to the highest value of the previous time period. You can save additional sales ranges by clicking on the **plus icon**.
