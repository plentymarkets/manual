== Returns

This statistic shows the monetary amounts of **returns** according to the selected **time span** and the **reason for return**. As an alternative to selecting a certain predefined time span, you can also choose an individual **start** and **end date**. Default setting for the **time span**: the **last 10 days**.

== Details about the statistic

The **number of sales orders** and the corresponding **revenue in Euro** will be displayed for the selected **time span**. Furthermore, the returns are sorted according to the **reason for return**. If a particular type of sales order did not occur during the selected time span, then this type of sales order will not be displayed. The name of the **reason for return** and the corresponding **amount in Euro** will be displayed as **information in a mouseover** (see image 1). In this statistic you can see, e.g. how many **returns** were made during a particular time period and how much of your **revenue** was affected. Furthermore, you can see how the **number** of returns and the corresponding **amounts** are divided up among the different **reasons for returns**. This can help you monitor your refunds.

[WARNING]
.**Item bundles**
====
The **number of returned items from item bundles** will be analyzed. However, the corresponding pass:q[<u>revenue will not</u>]. **Item bundles** do not have any data available within the **Statistics** tab.

|Entry/Setting |Explanation

|Diagram view

|**Type of diagram**
|In this drop-down menu, you can choose how you want the statistics to be displayed. +
**2D pie chart** = Displays the values as a two-dimensional pie chart +
**3D pie chart** = Displays the values as a three-dimensional pie chart +
**Data table** = An overview of the data in table format

|**Export**
|The data for this diagram is exported in a **CSV file**. The file contains the same parameters as are displayed with the **Data table** diagram.

|**Raw data export**
|The raw data export also generates a **CSV file**. However, the file contains a more detailed set of data. For example, instead of simply indicating the number of sales orders that were generated on a specific day, the CSV file includes relevant data fields for each individual sales order, such as the **sales order ID**, **price** etc.

|
|Settings

|**Name**
|Shows the **name** of the statistic that was entered when the statistic was created. You can change the name here.

|**Time span**
|Each type of statistic has a default setting for **time span** that you can see in table 1 on the <<start/statistics#, **Statistics**  >> page of the manual. You can choose from a number of predefined time spans in a drop-down menu. In addition for some types of statistics you have the possibility to enter a time span by entering a **start and end date**.

|
|**Change** the **time span** if no or only very few data is shown and then click on the save icon to see the result. Choosing a **larger time span** will give you more information. If there is a lot of data, then a **shorter time span** may make more sense in order to be able to actually interpret the graphic.

|**Starting date ... Ending date**
|You can enter a specific **starting and ending date** here instead of selecting a **time span** (optional).

|**Status options**
|Depending on the type of statistic there are different options available to narrow down the **status**. There are **standard values** set by default.

|**Multishop**
|Select the **webshops** or **multishops** that you would like to include into the statistic.

|**Sales order referrer**
|Select one or more **sales order referrers**. You can also use the option **All** to select all of the available sales order referrers at once.

|
|If you want to **compare** the **returns** for different markets, then create several different copies of this statistic and select only one market in each of them. Specify the particular market within the name of the statistic. This will allow you to easily compare them later on.

|For further information, refer to the **Start / Statistics** page of the manual.
