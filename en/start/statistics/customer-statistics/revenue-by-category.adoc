==  Info: revenue by category

This shows the **revenue (gross) per category** as well as the **number of items** that one specific customer purchased during a certain time span. Default setting for the **time span**: the **last 30 days**.

==  Details about the statistic

The **revenue (gross) per category** and the **number of items** purchased by the customer will be displayed for the selected **time span**. If no revenue is available, then the corresponding category will not be displayed. The **number of sold items** and the corresponding total **revenue** that the customer generated with this number of items will be displayed as **information in a mouseover** (see image 1). In this statistic you can see, e.g. how much revenue the customer generated in each of the different categories. If you change the time span, then you can also see how much revenue the customer generated in the different categories during a specific period of time.

| Entry/Setting | Explanation

|
| Diagram view

|**Type of diagram**
| In this drop-down menu, you can choose how you want the statistics to be displayed. +
**Bar and line chart** = Displays the values as bars and lines +
**3D pie chart** = Displays the values as a three-dimensional pie chart +
**2D pie chart** = Displays the values as a two-dimensional pie chart +
**Data table** = An overview of the data in table format

|**Export**
| The data for this diagram is exported in a **CSV file**. The file contains the same parameters as are displayed with the **Data table** diagram.

|**Raw data export**
| The raw data export also generates a **CSV file**. However, the file contains a more detailed set of data. For example, instead of simply indicating the number of sales orders that were generated on a specific day, the CSV file includes relevant data fields for each individual sales order, such as the **sales order ID**, **price** etc.

|**Displaying the values**
| Click on the diagram legend in the lower left corner to make a specific set of values **visible** or **invisible** in the diagram. This allows you to display data separately, i.e. to look at some aspects of the data and hide others. This can help you recognize individual values more easily if your data set is very complicated.

| Settings

|**Name**
| Shows the **name** of the statistic that was entered when the statistic was created. You can change the name here.

|**Time span**
| Each type of statistic has a default setting for **time span** that you can see in table 1 on the <<start/statistics#, **Statistics**  >> page of the manual. You can choose from a number of predefined time spans in a drop-down menu. In addition for some types of statistics you have the possibility to enter a time span by entering a **start and end date**.

|
|**Change** the **time span** if no or only very few data is shown and then click on the save icon to see the result. Choosing a **larger time span** will give you more information. If there is a lot of data, then a **shorter time span** may make more sense in order to be able to actually interpret the graphic.

|**Starting date ... Ending date**
| You can enter a specific **starting and ending date** here instead of selecting a **time span** (optional).

|**Date based on**
| Select which **date** you want the **analysis** to be **based on**, e.g. the date when the sales order was received.

|**Multishop**
| Select the **webshops** or **multishops** that you would like to include into the statistic.

|**Item referrer**
| Select one or more **item referrers**. Use the option **All** to select all of the available item referrers at once.

|**Display subcategories of**
| Select a category if you want to analyze its individual **subcategories**. The individual subcategories will then be displayed in the statistic instead of the main categories.

|**Payment method**
|**Select** which **payment method** should be included in the statistic or use the option **All** to include all of the payment methods.

|**Shipping profile**
|**Mark** which **shipping profiles** should be included in the statistic or use the option **All** to include all of the shipping profiles.

|**Paid sales orders only**
| Select this option if you only want to include **paid sales orders** in the statistic.

|**Sales orders with outgoing items booked only**
| Select this option if you only want to include **sales orders with outgoing items booked** in the statistic.

|**Chart**
| Select how you want the **amounts to be displayed** in the statistic: either as **gross** amounts or as **net** amounts.
