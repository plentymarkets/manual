[#property]
Property:: Some items stand out from the masses. It could be a waterproof watch or a speaker that is Bluetooth capable. In plentymarkets, these traits are called _characteristics_ and _properties_. They highlight the technical features of a product. The difference is that characteristics characterise whole items, whereas <<#property, properties>> characterise specific variations. Characteristics and properties also differ from <<#attribute, attributes>>, since both characterise products _without_ creating saleable variations. +
