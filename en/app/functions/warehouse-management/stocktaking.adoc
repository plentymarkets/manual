In plentymarkets you can also take stock using the plentymarkets app. Users must be assigned the right to take stock. In addition, <<stock-management/setting-up-a-warehouse, barcodes must be saved for your storage locations>>. You can activate the stocktaking mode to freeze stock during stocktaking. However, because the new stock data is saved to the variation automatically, you do not need to activate the stocktaking mode.

== Stocktaking with the plentymarkets app

When you take stock with the plentymarkets app, you can either scan each piece of an item individually or enter the counted quantity using the keypad.  The option *Scan items individually* controls how the stock taking is performed.

[IMPORTANT]
.Stock at a storage location is set to zero if not counted
====
Count or scan all items present at a storage location. If you store different items at the same storage location, any stock of items that you do not count or scan during stocktaking will be set to zero. Example: +
The stock information for storage location 1 in plentymarkets is 10 x item A, 10 x item B and 2 x item C. During stocktaking, 10 x item A and 10 x item B is scanned. Item C is not scanned. +
→ The app books item A x 10, item B x 10 and item C x 0. As such, stock for item C is set to zero. +
If you only start creating further storage locations during stocktaking, these storage locations are not set to zero. This applies only for storage locations that are edited.

=== Scanning each piece of an item individually

Users do not have to count the stock. Instead, they can scan the labels of each piece of an item individually until they have scanned all pieces of an item present at the storage location.

*_Tip:_* If the storage location contains more than one type of item, the quantity of the correct item is increased automatically during scanning. +
*_Note:_* To correct the scanned quantity manually, tap the item and enter the correct quantity. +
→ If best before dates, batches or both are managed for the variation in the selected warehouse, you are asked to enter a date, a batch or both.
. *_Optional:_* Select the best before date and/or enter the batch and tap *Add item*. +
→ The stock is booked in.

→ The counted quantity is saved. +
→ The counted stock is imported to the *Stock » Storage location management* menu of the plentymarkets back end. +
→ The stock information is saved in the *Item » Managing items* menu of the variation.
