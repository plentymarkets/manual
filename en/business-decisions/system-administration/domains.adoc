[#domain]

Do you want to set up new domains or subdomains? Do you need to order a new SSL certificate? Should the cache be deactivated temporarily?
Such tasks are usually completed by a _system administrator_. This page of the manual serves as a reference for system administrators and helps them complete their administrative tasks in plentymarkets.

[#50]
== Domains

plentymarkets includes an <<welcome/assistants#, assistant>> that helps you manage your domains.
You can use the assistant for example to create new domains or sub-domains and to migrate existing domains.

[.instruction]
Accessing the domain assistant:

. Go to *Setup » Assistants » Basic setup*.
. Click on the domain assistant. +
→ If you’ve already configured domains, then you’ll see them listed here.
. Click on an existing domain to open its settings. Or click on *New configuration* (icon:plus[role="green"]).
. The domain settings will vary depending on which type of domain you work with. In other words, you might not see all of the settings described on this page while you configure the domain in your plentymarkets system.

[TIP]
.Service Centre is being phased out
====
Perhaps you can remember previously managing your domains in the menu *plentymarkets Logo (Start) » Service centre*. The Service Centre is being phased out.
Therefore, we recommend that you use the assistant instead.
====

[WARNING]
.Availability after initial setup or changes
====
It can take up to 24 hours until all of the settings are available on all systems.
This is because the servers need to be restarted periodically and the data is not distributed in the cloud immediately.
====

<table-example-domains> includes explanations of the various domain types.

[[table-example-domains]]
.Examples of domains
[cols="1,1,1,1,4"]
|====
|Type |Addition |Example name |TLD |Explanation

|Domain
|--
|yourstore
|.com
|The word "domain" refers to an Internet address in the form of a name and an extension, i.e. the top level domain. The name can be chosen freely. A domain is unique, i.e. the exact same domain may never be used twice. Therefore, when registering a desired domain, e.g. with a hosting service provider, it is necessary to check whether the domain has already been used.

|Subdomain
|info.
|yourstore
|.com
|You can create as many subdomains as you want for a domain. Subdomains do not need to be registered. Subdomains use variations of the domain name. They are either placed in front of or behind the domain name and they are separated from it with a period.

|Additional domains
|--
|your-store +
your_store
|.com
|Additional domains are e.g. created with alternative names of the main domain. Additional domains redirect to the main domain. This ensures that the domain is also found if it is spelled differently. For example, the additional domain *your-store.com* would redirect customers to the main domain *yourstore.com*, even if they spelled it with a hyphen. The names and top level domains can be chosen freely for additional domains. Every additional domain receives the main domain's IP address.

|====
|I want to... |Additional information

|Order a new domain, hosted by plentysystems
|You will receive an email when registering a .com domain. This email will ask you to confirm the WHOIS data that was entered. This email is sent to the email address that was entered under ADMIN-C in the handle data (WHOIS). If you do not receive an email, check that the email address is available and working.

|Add a new domain, hosted externally
|Use this option to link an existing, external domain with the plentymarkets system. The domain's IP address will be displayed in the overview of domains. Then save the <<#160, DNS data>> in your hosting service provider’s DNS zone area. If there is an IPv6 A Record in your externally managed domain, then remove this IPv6 A-Record.

|Add a new subdomain to an existing domain
|You can create as many subdomains as you want for a domain. You do not need to register these subdomains. For example, if you have the domain *yourstore.com*, then you could create the subdomain *info.yourstore.com* to provide special information about your online store with this domain. Use the drop-down list to select which main domain you want to link with the subdomain. Select the corresponding plentymarkets system as well.

|Transfer an existing domain to plentysystems
a|The processing times may vary depending on the Top Level Domain:

* For *.de* domains: up to 24 hours
* For *.com* and *.net* domains: 3 to 7 days
* For *.eu* domains: up to 5 days
* You will receive an email if you relocate a *.com* or *.net* domain. The email will ask you to confirm the relocation. This email is sent to the email address that was entered under ADMIN-C in the handle data (WHOIS). If you do not receive an email, check that the email address is available and working. If the email address no longer exists, then ask your current domain provider to change the email address.

=== Choosing the client

Here you can link the domain to a plentymarkets system or change a system link. If you set up multiple domains, you can select which one should be used as the main domain for each plentymarkets client. The URL will then be displayed in the browser's address line. This is also the case for the other domains. It can take up to 24 hours until all of the settings are available on all systems.

[WARNING]
.Switching the main domain
====
If you switch the main domain, then change the URL accordingly on all platforms and in the interface settings in your plentymarkets system, e.g. in the settings for payment providers. +
In addition, go to <<payment/managing-bank-details#70, Setup » Orders » Payment » EBICS>> and save the data there once again, in order to update the basic settings.
====

[WARNING]
.Linking an external system
====
You cannot link a plentymarkets system with an external server if the domain is your main domain. In this case, select a different main domain before proceeding.
====

[.instruction]
Linking a plentymarkets system:

. <<#50, Open the domain assistant>> and navigate to the step *Choose the client*.
. Use the drop-down list to select which plentymarkets system you want to link the domain to. If you use your own server, select the setting *External server*.
. *_Optional:_* Enter the IP address (A-Record) of the external server.
. *_Optional:_* Toggle the button (icon:toggle-on[role="green"]) if you want this to be the client’s primary domain.

.*Settings for an external mail server*
--

Here you’ll save information about the mail server that’s used to send and receive emails. No additional settings are required if you use the mailbox.org mail server. If you use your own server, then save the values for the IP address as well as MX10 through MX40 if available.

[[table-account-parameter-mailserver]]
[cols="1,3"]

|Setting |Explanation

|*spf*
|Enter the link:https://forum.plentymarkets.com/t/how-to-verhindern-dass-eigene-mails-im-spam-landen-spf-record-anlegen/529178[SPF record] for your email provider.

|*ip*
|Enter the incoming mail server's IP address. Access is provided with the address mail.[yourdomain].com. +
*_Note:_* Replace _[yourdomain].com_ with your own domain.

|*mx10*; +
*mx20*; +
*mx30*; +
*mx40*
|Enter the mail server for receiving emails. The server MX10 takes priority. In other words, emails are first sent to mail server MX10. If this mail server is not available, the emails will be sent to the mail server MX20. The lower the MX number, the higher the server's priority. +
*_Tip:_* You should save at least two mail servers to ensure that the availability is never compromised. For example, if a server is down or needs to be maintained, emails can still be received with the other server.
|====

[.collapseBox]
.*Generate an AuthCode*
--

You need to have an authentication code for your domain if you switch to a different provider. This auth code proves that you own the domain.

Click on *Generate*. The code is generated and displayed in the field *Domain Authcode*. +
*_Note:_* A domain auth code is valid for 30 days. If you do not use the code during this time, you will have to generate a new code when needed.

[discrete]
==== Further info

If you want to switch to a different webhosting provider, then you will need to carry out a domain name transfer (also known as a KK or auth info procedure in Germany). You need to fill out a standardized form of authorization in order for the domain to be transferred. The German form is called a connectivity coordination application, abbreviated as a KK-Antrag. The connectivity coordination application regulates the switch from one provider to another. The auth info procedure is becoming more and more popular.

Please note the following points when switching to a different web hosting provider:

* Generate an auth code.
* Do not delete your previous domain name with your current provider.
* Tell your current provider about your plans to transfer the domain and let them know that they will soon receive an authorization form.
* Contact the new provider in regards to the transfer. Your new provider will ask you to sign a form and confirm that you want to transfer the domain.

It is usually possible to transfer the domain without any problems. The process can be completed in a short amount of time. However, if you have any problems with the domain transfer because of incomplete or unclear data, then your old provider may initially reject the transfer. In such a case, contact the old provider as soon as possible. The current provider can only accept the transfer once there are no further uncertainties.

[TIP]
======
*IPS tag*: If you want to transfer your *.uk* or *.co.uk* domain to plentymarkets from a different domain provider, you need to have your current domain provider adapt the IPS tag in advance. Our domain provider’s IPS tag is:

*UNITEDDOMAINS-DE*

.*Configure CNAME Records*
--

A Canonical Name or CNAME record is a type of DNS record that links an alias name to another canonical domain name. For example, you can use it along with the provider Shopgate to create a mobile version of your online store or you can use it to set up an external email service.

This is done by entering a source and a target.
In the example, the source _mobile.your-shop.com_ is the mobile version of the domain _your-shop.com_. Use the Shopgate subdomain _cname.shopgate.com_ as the target. This CNAME entry ensures that your store will have the correct resolution with Shopgate.

[#240]
[.collapseBox]
.*Configure TXT Records*
--

Use the TXT Resource Record to save a user-definable text within a DNS zone. This can be done for your main domain as well as for all sub-domains of your online store. For example, email or newsletter service providers may require such entries. Your service provider will give you the data to be entered.

This is done by entering the data that you received from the service provider.

--

[#200]
[.collapseBox]
.*Configure your own name servers for subdomains*
--

Here you’ll enter one or more name servers for a sub-domain. This is done by entering the sub-domain and the domain name of the target server. Please note:

* You can only save name servers for sub-domains of a main domain.
* You can enter multiple name servers for a sub-domain. Simply click on the plus symbol again.
* Enter the name server's domain name.

--
[#265]
[.collapseBox]
.*URL forwarding*
--

Here you can set up forwarding for an extra charge.
This is done by entering redirect information into the designated field. You can define one redirect per line. Note the following syntax information while entering redirects.
Changes will be published on the web servers within 24 hours.

[discrete]
==== Structure

Redirects always consist of four parts that are separated by semicolons:

* Source;Target;HTTP-code;Option

[[table-forwarding-structure]]
[cols="1,3"]
|====
|Part |Explanation

|*Source*
|The source path you want to forward from (e.g. `/contact/`). Use an asterisk `\*` at the end of the source if you want all of the subpages to redirect to the target (e.g. `/contact/*`).

|*Target*
|The target path or target URL you want to forward to (e.g. `/company/contact/` or `\http://www.external-domain.com/contact/`).

|*HTTP code*
a|The following HTTP codes are supported and interpreted by search engines:

* 301: The requested source is now available at the defined target (also called redirect). The old address (source) is no longer valid.
* 304: The contents of the requested resource have not been modified since the last client query. Therefore, the contents are not retransmitted.

|*Option*
a|You don’t always need to specify an option.

* L: If you specify this option, no additional RewriteRule is run after this one.
|====

[discrete]
==== Examples

[[table-forwarding-examples]]
[cols="1,3"]
|====
|Redirect |Explanation

|`/mens/*;/fashion/mens/;301;L`
|All URLs that start with `/mens/` are forwarded to the URL `/fashion/mens/`.

|`/mens/trousers/;/fashion/mens/trousers/;301;L`
|The URL `/mens/trousers/` is forwarded to the URL `/fashion/mens/trousers/`.

|`/mens/basics-\*;/fashion/mens/*;301;L`
|All URLs that start with `/mens/basic` are forwarded to the URL `/fashion/mens/…`​. +
*_Note:_* In this example, the part of the source URL that starts with `basics-` is appended to the target URL.

|`/;\https://www.external-blog.com/;301;L`
|The homepage is forwarded to the URL `\https://www.external-blog.com/`.

|`/*;\https://www.external-blog.com/;301;L`
|All URLs, including the homepage, are forwarded to the URL `\https://www.external-blog.com/`. +
*_Note:_* Never set this redirect for your main store. Otherwise the plentymarkets admin will no longer be accessible. However, you can use this redirect for additional clients (stores) without any problem.

|`/blog/*;\https://www.external-blog.com/;301;L`
|All URLs that start with `/blog/` are forwarded to the URL `\https://www.external-blog.com/`.

|`^/fashion/trousers/$;/fashion/mens/trousers/;301;L`
|This rule only applies to the address `your-domain.com/fashion/mens/` without anything before or after. The circumflex `^` symbolises the beginning of the string and the dollar sign `$` symbolises the end of the string. Use this syntax if you have multiple lines of redirects that have e.g. `/fashion/trousers/` as the source URL and you want to avoid undesired redirects or endless redirects.

[#ssl-zertifikat]
== SSL certificate

This chapter provides you with information about SSL certificates. You’ll learn how to check the expiration date on your SSL certificate, how to order a new SSL certificate and how to deactivate your active SSL certificate if necessary.

[#280]
=== What is an SSL certificate?

An SSL certificate is used to encrypt your website. It provides a secure connection to your website and your online store. An SSL certificate is required for certain markets and for receiving the Trusted Shops certification. You know you’re using an SSL certificate if your website is accessed via _https_.

SSL certificates are offered by independent certificate providers. plentymarkets offers 2 types of SSL certificates:

* A paid SSL certificate with a duration of at least one year without renewal. After the SSL certificate expires, you need to order a new certificate.
* A free SSL certificate from link:https://letsencrypt.org[Let’s Encrypt^]. It is automatically renewed and can be cancelled with one month notice.

You order the SSL certificate for your main domain, i.e. the domain that is listed as the primary domain in the menu *Setup » Assistants » Basic setup » Domain assistant*.
Quick tip: Look at your domains with the table view. This will help you recognise which one is the primary domain.

If you want to set up an SSL certificate for a different domain, you will have to <<#210a, set this domain as your main domain>> first.

.Domain assistant with the table view
image::business-decisions/system-administration/assets/Primary-Domain.png[]

[IMPORTANT]
.No SSL certificates for cancelled domains or test domains
====
You cannot order SSL certificates for cancelled domains, start-up domains and test domains, i.e. domains with names that contain _plenty-testdrive.eu_, _plentymarkets-x1.com_ etc. Therefore, the *Order SSL certificate* button is not displayed for these types of domains.
====

[#360]
=== SSL certificate for external domains

You can continue to have a domain hosted externally and <<#160, save the DNS settings with this external provider>>. However, the SSL certificate needs to be saved close to the system. This means that even if the domain is hosted externally, the actual encoding is done directly in the system after the domain forwarding via IP address is carried out. As such, it is not possible to use an external SSL certificate. The SSL certificate needs to be ordered from plentymarkets.

[#290]
=== Prerequisites for booking an SSL certificate

Before booking an SSL certificate, make sure that your system meets the following requirements:

==== Domain

* It’s only possible to order an SSL certificate for a <<#280, primary domain>>. +
→ Check the settings in the domain assistant.

==== Active autoscaling

A few systems have not been switched to link:https://aws.amazon.com/de/autoscaling/[autoscaling] (AS). In most cases, this is because the domain is not hosted by plentymarkets. As such, the domain owner must adjust the DNS settings manually.
Another cause might be that the domain was added to a client for the first time. These clients are not automatically switched to autoscaling. The plentymarkets support team needs to manually activate autoscaling.

Proceed as described below to check if autoscaling is active:

[.instruction]
Checking the autoscaling status:

. <<#50, Open the domain assistant>> and navigate to the step *Current DNS Settings*. +
*_Note:_* This step only appears if you selected *Add a new domain, hosted externally* in the step <<#100, Domain type>>.
//. Go to *plentymarkets logo (Start) » Service centre*. +
//*_Tip:_* To do so, point your cursor at the plentymarkets logo at the top left of the screen. +
//→ The Service centre opens in a new browser tab.
//. Click on the blue *plus* icon of the system. +
//→ The available tabs are shown.
//. Click on the *Domain* tab.
//. Click on the blue plus icon next to the domain to view the DNS settings. +
// → The DNS settings are shown.
. In the column *DNS Record Type*, check if a CNAME entry exists for the domain. +
→ If a CNAME entry exists, autoscaling is active. An SSL certificate can be ordered. +
→ If no CNAME entry exists, but rather two A records, autoscaling is not active.
. If autoscaling is not active, contact the plentymarkets support via the link:https://forum.plentymarkets.com/t/46996/[plentymarkets Forum] and ask them to activate autoscaling. The thread is in German, but the support staff can also speak English.

==== For subdomains: Existing parent domain

If you want to order an SSL certificate for a subdomain, then the parent domain must also exist in the assistant. The relationship between the domain and subdomain must also be entered correctly in the assistant. +
→ Check the settings in the assistant. +
→ If the parent domain was deleted from the assistant, then create the parent domain again. If you do not want this parent domain to point to plentymarkets, but rather e.g. to Showare, then save an external A record for the parent domain by <<#210a, creating a system link>>.

==== For external domains: DNS settings

* The <<#160, DNS settings saved for the external provider>> must be identical to the DNS settings saved in the assistant. +
→ Check the settings in the service area of your domain provider.
* The domain that the SSL certificate is being ordered for must not have an IPv6 entry (AAAA record). +
→ Check the settings in the service area of your domain provider.
* If the domain has any existing CAA records, then they must allow for the selected certificate to be ordered. +
→ Check the settings in the service area of your domain provider.

[#300]
=== Managing paid SSL certificates

If you buy an SSL certificate, you need to order a new SSL certificate before your old certificate expires. Even if you already have an SSL certificate, you will still need to order a new certificate before it expires. You will need to select a certificate provider and duration every time you order an SSL certificate. plentymarkets orders the SSL certificate on your behalf and bills you for the one-off purchase price and the monthly fee.

[#310]
==== Checking the expiration date of an SSL certificate

Proceed as described below to view the expiration date of an SSL certificate.

[.instruction]
Checking the expiration date of an SSL certificate:

. Go to *Setup » Client » Select client » SSL*. +
→ You will see a table with the domain’s certificates. +
→ The column *Valid until* shows you when the certificate expires.

[#320]
==== Buying an SSL certificate

Proceed as described below to order a paid SSL certificate.

[.instruction]

[#cache]
== Cache

The static content of your online store, e.g. item images, are stored in the cache for a certain amount of time. This makes it possible to display such content as quickly as possible. If you make changes, e.g. to an image, then these changes will not go into effect immediately. Rather, it may take up to 1 hour for the changes to become visible. Take a look at our link:https://www.plentymarkets.eu/blog/Im-Rollout-Mehr-Geschwindigkeit-bei-durchgehender-SSL-Verschluesselung/b-1207/[blog entry] on this topic (only available in German).

=== Permanent SSL redirect

If you booked an SSL certificate, your website will be completely encrypted. The technology SNI/TLS is a common standard that has been used for years. It is supported by all current browsers. However, some of your store’s visitors may use older browsers that do not support this standard. If you deactivate the SSL redirect, then visitors with older browsers will also be able to click through your online store. However, customers will only be able to place an order with current browsers. The order process is always encoded, even if the SSL redirect was deactivated. You can inform customers that it is only possible to place an order with current browsers.

[.instruction]
Deactivating the permanent SSL redirect:

. Go to *plentymarkets logo (Start) » Service centre*. +
*_Tip:_* To do so, point your cursor at the plentymarkets logo at the top left of the screen. +

== Hosting data

How much data volume and traffic you have depends on your contract. You will be billed if you exceed the amount of memory available to you. As such, you can track the data volume your plentymarkets system uses at any time.

Usage data is displayed in the menu *plentymarkets Logo (Start) » Hosting*.
Click on one of the sub-menus on the left to access the corresponding data.

[#490]
=== Information about traffic

Traffic is generated every time a person visits your online store, clicks on various items, clicks on images to enlarge them, downloads files, etc.

Additional traffic is generated in the following cases:

* When exchanging data with markets.
* REST calls, since they create connections to the server. +
*_Tip:_* Depending on the type of call, they may generate a substantial amount of traffic. You should optimize your calls, e.g. so that you do not retrieve all of the information, but rather only the changes.
* When your website is scanned by link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_crawler[bots^]. The bots save your pages, which results in traffic. For example, a Google bot does this so that Google can find items from your store along with their descriptions. Bots are controlled by proprietary algorithms, which makes it impossible to predict when such bots will visit your website. +
*_Tip:_* To take some control of bot behaviour, you can <<online-store/setting-up-ceres#203, block bots>> using the robots.txt file.
* If your product portfolio has expanded, resulting in more data and images. This will cause more bots to crawl your site.

[#500]
== System relocation

Use the menu *plentymarkets Logo (Start) » Relocation* to relocate your system to a different cloud free of charge. The *Relocation* menu also lists the status of any planned relocation projects and information about any previous relocation projects. Refer to our website for further information about the link:https://www.plentymarkets.co.uk/product/cloud-hosting/[cloud solutions provided by plentymarkets].

[#510]
=== System relocation requirements

Make sure that the following requirements are met before you begin planning to relocate your system to a different cloud:

* You must have a current plentymarkets cloud contract. If you do not have a plentymarkets Cloud contract, then <<business-decisions/your-contract#, change your contract information>>.
* The system relocation must be scheduled to begin at least 2 days in the future.

[WARNING]
.Files on FTP server are not migrated
====
When your system is relocated to a different cloud, the FTP host address of the plentymarkets system also changes. The files stored on the old FTP host are not copied to the new FTP host address during relocation. You need to move the FTP files manually.
====

[WARNING]
.Change the IP address with your external domain provider
====
When you relocate your system, your IP address changes. If your domain is hosted by an external provider, then you will need to save the new IP address with your external domain provider. This ensures that your online store remains accessible. plentymarkets does not have access to the data of your external domain and cannot make these changes for you. Check your domain provider’s documentation for information about saving your new IP address there.

=== Planning a relocation

Proceed as described below to plan the relocation of your system to a different cloud. Please note that it is not possible to simultaneously relocate more than one system per cloud. As such, the relocation start time may be delayed.

[.instruction]
Planning a relocation:

. Go to *plentymarkets Logo (Start) » Relocation*. +
*_Tip:_* To do so, point your cursor at the plentymarkets logo at the top left of the screen. +

[IMPORTANT]
.Store availability
====
For mid-sized systems, relocation takes approximately 20 minutes. However, the actual duration always depends on the volume of data that is to be relocated. Your plentymarkets system is available during this time. However, you cannot save any changes in the system. Your store’s order process is also deactivated while your system is being relocated. Therefore, choose a time when you do not anticipate a large amount of traffic. We recommend that you plan the relocation for the middle of the night.
====

[#530]
=== Cancelling a planned relocation

You can cancel a planned relocation any time before the processes in the menu *plentymarkets Logo (Start) » Relocation » Tab: Planned relocation* have been completed. The relocation will be cancelled as soon as possible. It may not be possible to cancel the relocation immediately. Proceed as described below to cancel a planned relocation.

[.instruction]
Cancelling a relocation:
