The world of e-commerce is constantly changing. For you as a seller, it is essential to keep up to date with the numbers and data of your business. Thus, plentymarkets offers you a new dashboard that enables you to access the current key figures of your company and decide if further action is needed. Create your individual dashboard by combining various key figures, statistics, graph types and format options.

[#100]
== Carrying out preparatory settings

A few preparatory steps are necessary before you can set up your individual dashboard. These settings are described in the following chapters.

[#200]
=== Kennzahlen anlegen

To display data on your dashboard, you need to create key figures beforehand. You can create key figures in the separate menu provided for this purpose. Alternatively, you can create key figures directly from the dashboard. Both methods are described in the following chapters. 

[IMPORTANT]
.Pay attention to user rights
====
If users without admin access to your plentymarkets system should create key figures, assign the  <<#300, relevant user rights>> first.
====

[#210]
==== Creating key figures in the setup menu

This method is especially useful if you want to create a high number of key figures at once.

[.instruction]
Creating key figures in the setup menu:

. Go to *Setup » plentyBI » Key figures*.
. Carry out the settings according to <<table-create-key-figures>>.
. Save icon:save[set=plenty] the settings.

[[table-create-key-figures]]
.Creating key figures
[cols="1,3"]
|====

|Setting |Explanation

| *Name*
| Enter a name for the key figure.

| *Key figure*
| Wähle die Kennzahl aus, die angelegt werden soll. Die folgenden Kennzahlen sind verfügbar: +
* Revenue +
* Sales volume +
* Shipping revenue +
* Gross revenue +
* Average order value +
* Average number of order items +
* Return rate +
* Orders +
* VAT total +
* Messages +
* Marketplace stock movements

| *Comment*
| If needed, enter a comment for the key figure. This comment is saved with the key figure and can help to provide you and your employees with specific information on the key figure.

2+| *Target values* area

| [#option-zielwert]*for days and weeks*, *for months*, *for quarters*, *for years*
| Enter target values that should be reached by the key figure. Depending on the desired period of time, you can make flexbile entries for the target values you are planning for the key figure.

|====

The second step consists of setting up filters for the key figures. Filters allow you to limit the data used by the key figure. You can select and combine several filters. Proceed as described below to set up filters.

[.instruction]
Setting up filters:

. Go to the *Filters* area in the *Setup » plentyBI » Key figures* menu.
. Click on icon:listing_create[set=plenty].
. Carry out the desired settings. Pay attention to the information provided in <<table-key-figures-filter-settings>>.
. *Save* icon:save[set=plenty] the settings.

[[table-key-figures-filter-settings]]
.Filter einrichten
[cols="1,3"]
|====

|Setting |Explanation
|icon:listing_create[set=plenty]
|Adds a new filter. Different filters are available for each key figures. For example, the following filters are available for the key figure *Revenue*:
* Client (store) +
* Order referrer +
* Order type +
* Order Status +
* Order property type +
* Order property value +
* Item ID +
* Item type +
* Revenue account +
* Invoice country +
* Delivery country +
* Completed +
* Payment status +
* Warehouse +
* Amazon account +
* eBay account +
* Shipping profile +
* Paid at + 
* Completed at +
* Payment method +
* Manufacturer +
* Return reason +

After selected one of the filters listed above, further options appear to the right. For example, if you want to filter by order type, start by selecting the filter *Order type* and proceed by activating the specific order types in the settings to the right. +
You can create a maximum of 10 filters. This allows you to filter by order type, order referrer, client (store) and more within the same key figure.

| *Comparison operator*
| Decide how the filter for the key figure should work. Depending on the selected key figure, different options are available for this setting.

|icon:folder_openable[set=plenty]
|Adds another filter to an existing filter. This way, you can set up nested structures for a filter. You can use a maximum of 2 of these sub-filters for a filter.

|icon:trash[set=plenty]
|Deletes a filter.

[#220]
==== Creating key figures on the dashboard

Do you want to add key figures to a new or existing dasboard? You can conveniently do so on the dashboard itself.

[IMPORTANT]
.Possible settings when creating key figures on the dashboard
====
When creating key figures on the dashboard, it is not possible to set up target values for those key figures. However, you can later add those settings for the key figure in the *Setup » plentyBI » Key figures* menu.
====

[.instruction]
Creating key figures on the dasboard:

. Go to *plentymarkets logo (Start) » Dashboard (Beta)*.
. Click on *Edit view* icon:design_inline_edit[set=plenty]. +
→ The settings menu opens.

→ A window for setting up the new key figure opens.
. Enter a *Name* for the key figure.
. Carry out the settings according to <<table-create-key-figures>>.
. Click on *Save*.

[#300]
=== Assigning user rights

When working with user rights, you should decide which of your employees should be allowed to view which key figures. Users with admin access to your plentymarkets system can view all key figures and create new ones by default.
Users with a *Back end* account have to be assigned those rights by a user with an admin account.

Proceed as described below to determine which key figures should be visible for a user.

[.instruction]
Assigning rights for viewing key figures:

. Go to *Setup » Settings » User » Rights » Users*.
→ The overview opens. +
*_Optional:_* In the filter settings on the left, enter an ID or a name to limit the search results.

Im BI Dashboards soll dies über die Ansichts-Auswahl oben rechts möglich sein. Die Funktionalität soll zum Kongress mit released werden und muss noch dokumentiert werden. Hier fehlen aber noch Infos.

[#400]
== Setting up the dashboard

Once you have carried out the <<#100, preparatory settings>>, you are ready to set up your dashboard.

The first steps on a new dashboard always consist of placing different areas for display on the dashboard. Then, you fill these areas with data that can be displayed in the form of different elements. You can add and indiviually position several elements per area. Thus, you do not have to place a separate area for every single element.

[#410]
=== Adding elements to the dashboard

The dashboard offers you a variety of different possibilites for visualising your data. You can use the following types of elements: 

* <<#500, Tiles>>
* <<#600, Tables>>
* <<#700, Diagrams>>
* <<#800, Rows>>
* <<#900, Notifications>>

The process of placing an element on the dashboard is always the same, regardless of the element type. The following instructions explain how it works.

[#420]

[.instruction]
Adding an element to the dashboard:

. Go to *plentymarkets logo (Start) » Dashboard (Beta)*.
. Click on *Edit view* icon:design_inline_edit[set=plenty]. +
→ The settings menu opens.
. Use Drag&Drop to place an element from the settings menu on the dashboard.
. Move the cursor over the element and click on icon:design_inline_edit[set=plenty]. +
→ The settings menu for the element opens. +
→ The possible elements for the area are displayed.
. Select an element from the settings menu and use Drag&Drop to place it within the area on the dashboard.
. *Save* icon:save[set=plenty] the settings.

The following chapters describe how to use the different elements and which settings are possible for each element.

[#500]
