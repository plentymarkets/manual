== Your contract with plentymarkets

Open the menu *plentymarkets Logo (Start) » My account » Contracts* to see and edit information about your contract with plentymarkets.
For example, you can:

* <<#30, switch to a different rate>>
* <<#40, view your booked services and cancel them as needed>>
* <<business-decisions/legal-requirements/gdpr#500, view documents that are relevant to GDPR>>

[TIP]
.Service Centre was removed
====
Perhaps you can remember previously looking at your contract information in the menu *plentymarkets Logo (Start) » Service centre*. The Service Centre was phased out.
Contract information is now managed in the "My account" area.
====

=== Changing your contract

plentymarkets grows along with your needs.
You can decide, e.g. which modules your company needs and approximately how many orders you’ll process with plentymarkets each month.
We will provide you with the necessary system performance.

You can use the “My account” area to make changes to your plentymarkets contract any time, i.e. even while the system is up and running.
It makes sense to change your contract e.g. if you generate more orders than are included in your current rate. It is possible to book a higher rate at any time. If you book a lower rate, the change will go into effect once the regular duration of your current contract has ended.

=== Practical example: Booking an additional store

In plentymarkets, the term <<online-store#, client (store)>> refers to an additional online store, which is managed with the same plentymarkets system as the default store.
Existing online stores are displayed in the “My account” area. You can book additional stores as needed.

[IMPORTANT]
.Domain settings for clients (stores)

== Granting certified agencies access to the system

Open the menu *plentymarkets Logo (Start) » My account » Agencies* to grant certified service providers access to your system.
It makes sense to grant a service provider access to your system, e.g. if you hired a design agency to create your website or if you work with a consultant.
The service provider will be given unlimited access to your system, i.e. admin access.

[TIP]
.Decide which functions and menus should be accessible!
====
When giving an agency access to your system, you grant it unlimited, admin access.

If you would prefer to only give the agency access to specific functions or menus, then <<business-decisions/user-accounts-access#, create a new user account>>, e.g. a back end account, and customise its access rights.
====

[#450]
