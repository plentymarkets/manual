== Your contract with plentymarkets

Open the menu *plentymarkets Logo (Start) » My account » Contracts* to see and edit information about your contract with plentymarkets.
For example, you can:

* <<#30, switch to your different rate>>
* <<#40, view your booked services and cancel them as needed>>
* <<business-decisions/legal-requirements/gdpr#500, view documents that are relevant to GDPR>>

[TIP]
.Service centre has been removed
====
Perhaps you can remember previously looking at your contract information in the menu *plentymarkets Logo (Start) » Service centre*. The Service centre is now deprecated.
Contract information is now managed in the “My account” area.
====

=== Changing your contract

plentymarkets grows along with your needs.
You can decide, e.g. which modules your company needs and approximately how many orders you’ll process with plentymarkets each month.
We will provide you with the necessary system performance.

You can use the “My account” area to make changes to your plentymarkets contract any time, i.e. even while the system is up and running.
It makes sense to change your contract e.g. if you generate more orders than are included in your current rate. It is possible to book a higher rate at any time. If you book a lower rate, the change will go into effect once the regular duration of your current contract has ended.

=== Viewing services and cancelling them as needed

You can see all of your billed services in the “My account” area. If needed, you can cancel individual modules or your entire contract with plentymarkets.

[.instruction]
Viewing and cancelling services:

. Go to *plentymarkets Logo (Start) » My account*. +
*_Tip:_* To do so, point your cursor at the plentymarkets logo at the top left of the screen. +
→ The “My account” area opens in a new browser tab.
. Click on icon:file-text[role="darkGrey"] *Contracts*. +
→ You will see information about your current contracts.

.*End of contract: Data*
--

Before your contract ends or you cancel it, you should think about which data you need beyond the existence of your system. Because your data is not saved automatically and thus will not be accessible anymore. With cancelling your contract you also confirm that all of your data is irrevocably deleted four to six weeks after the contract ends. +
Therefore, you should for example think about which information is tax relevant and thus needed later and which legal retention obligations you have to comply with. In the following, we give you an overview of possible data exports from your plentymarkets system:

[[table-end-of-contract-data-export]]
.Recommended exports when contract ends
[cols="1,3"]
|====
|Setting|Explanation

|*Accounting data*
| Use the custom export in the *Data » Custom export* menu to export your financial accounting. To do so, choose the export you need from the drop-down list (e.g. *Financial accounting*) and select the appropriate settings.

|*Documents*
|Use the document archive to export relevant documents. To do so, go to the *Orders » Document archive* menu and switch to the *Export* tab. Select the appropriate settings and export all relevant documents. When selecting the documents and the time period, take legal tax requirements and retention periods into consideration.

|*Stock*
|Create a data format for your <<data/exporting-data/FormatDesigner/format-types/stock#, stock data>> in the *Data » Elastic export* menu. We recommend to select at least the following export fields: +
- Item.id = Item ID +
- ItemDescription.name = Item name +
- Variation.name = Variation name +
- Stock.averagePurchasePrice = Average purchase price +
- Stock.stock.Physical = Physical stock +
- Stock.stockNet = Net stock +
- Warehouse.name = Warehouse name

|*Stock movement*
|Create a data format for your <<data/exporting-data/FormatDesigner/format-types/stock-movement#, stock movement>> in the *Data » Elastic export* menu. We recommend to select at least the following export fields: +
- StockMovements.id = Process ID of the stock movement +
- StockMovements.itemid = Item ID +
- Variation.id = Variation ID +
- StockMovements.attributeValues = Attribute values +
- StockMovements.warehouseName = Name of the warehouse where stock was moved in or out +

- StockMovements.quantity = Quantity of items included in the stock movement +
- User.user = Name of the user who booked the stock movement +
- StockMovements.createdAt = Date of the stock movement

|====

This list is a recommendation and makes no claim to be complete. If needed, create further exports for relevant information and data. If in doubt, always consult a tax advisor.

Contact our Sales team if you have further questions about your contract. To do so, you can use the forum, write an email (sales@plentymarkets.com) or phone us (*0561 98 681 010*).

=== Practical example: Booking an additional online store

In plentymarkets, the term <<online-store#, client (store)>> refers to an additional online store, which is managed with the same plentymarkets system as the default store.
Existing online stores are displayed in the “My account” area. You can book additional stores as needed.

[IMPORTANT]
.Domain settings for clients (stores)
====
You need to have a <<business-decisions/system-administration/domains#, domain>> before you can order a client (store). You have to create this domain for the main system beforehand.
====

[.instruction]
Ordering a client (store):

. Go to *plentymarkets Logo (Start) » My account*. +
*_Tip:_* To do so, point your cursor at the plentymarkets logo at the top left of the screen. +
→ The “My account” area opens in a new browser tab.
. Click on icon:file-text[role="darkGrey"] *Contracts*. +
→ You will see information about your current contracts.
. Click on icon:pencil[role="darkGrey"] *Edit contract*. +
→ The configurator appears.
. Make changes to the contract information as desired.

== Granting certified agencies access to the system

Open the menu *plentymarkets Logo (Start) » My account » Agencies* to grant certified service providers access to your system.
It makes sense to grant a service provider access to your system, e.g. if you hired a design agency to create your website or if you work with a consultant.
The service provider will be given unlimited access to your system, i.e. admin access.

[TIP]
.Decide which functions and menus should be accessible!
====
When giving an agency access to your system, you grant it unlimited, admin access.

If you would prefer to only give the agency access to specific functions or menus, <<business-decisions/user-accounts-access#, create a new user account>>, e.g. a back end account, and customise its access rights.
====

[#450]
=== Granting access

Proceed as described below to grant an agency and/or consultant access to your system:

[.instruction]
Assigning service providers:

. Go to *plentymarkets Logo (Start) » My account*. +

[#460]
=== Withdrawing access

Would you like to permanently withdraw access for an agency? Then proceed as described below.

. Click on *Remove now* to confirm your decision. +
→ System access for the selected agency is permanently withdrawn.

[IMPORTANT]
.Effective withdrawal of agency access
====
Always follow the steps described above to safely and permanently withdraw agency access to your system. It is **not** sufficient to simply <<business-decisions/user-accounts-access#85, delete the user account>> created by the agency in your plentymarkets back end.
