:key-figure: Messages

include::../../_textblocks/plentyBI-template/key-figure-introduction.adoc[]

plentymarkets calculates the key figure *Messages* based on the number of messages or the sum of minutes that were saved for the messages.

By choosing a <<business-decisions/plenty-bi/key-figures/messages#100, calculation type>>, you decide whether to calculate with the number of messages or the sum of minutes. In addition, select a <<business-decisions/plenty-bi/key-figures/messages#200, dimension>> and <<business-decisions/plenty-bi/key-figures/messages#300, filters>> to specify the criteria of the messages.
