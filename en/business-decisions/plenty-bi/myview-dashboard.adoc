In the constantly changing world of e-commerce, it is essential to keep an overview of the numbers and data of your online business. Thus, plentymarkets offers you a new dashboard that enables you to access the current key figures of your company and decide if further action is needed. Create your individual dashboard by combining various key figures, statistics, graph types and format options. The dashboard allows you to be as flexible and creative as you like.

Especially when creating your first dashboard, there are some important considerations. Thus, pay close attention to the preparatory settings and follow the instructions in the following chapters carefully:

** <<#200, Creating key figures>>
** <<#300, Assigning user rights>>
** <<#400, Setting up the dashboard>>

[#100]
== Carrying out the preparatory settings

Only a few preparatory settings are necessary before you can set up your individual dashboard. These settings are described in the following chapters.

[#200]
=== Creating key figures

[IMPORTANT]
.Key figure availability depends on plentyBI edition
====
To create key figures, you need to book a corresponding plentyBI edition. Go to *plentymarkets logo (Start) » My account » Contracts*. Different plentyBI editions with varying scopes are available in the *Book plentyBI edition* section. Furthermore, edition information is displayed for each key figure in the *Setup » plentyBI » Key figures* menu.
====

To display data on your dashboard, you need to create key figures first.

Key figures essentially allow you to create different data sets. This way, key figures are a basis for the values and data that you can then display and track on your dashboard. Your plentymarkets system provides so-called dimensions for each key figure. Dimensions determine the criteria that are used to group the data included in the key figure.
This way, you can precisely define the conditions for the calculation of each key figure.

You can create key figures in the separate menu provided for this purpose. Alternatively, you can create key figures directly from the dashboard. Both methods are described in the following chapters.

[TIP]
.Pay attention to user rights
====
If users without admin access to your plentymarkets system should be allowed to create key figures, assign the <<#300, necessary user rights>> first.
====

[#210]
==== Creating key figures in the setup menu

This method is especially useful if you want to create a high number of key figures at once. <<table-create-key-figures>> contains a list of available <<#option-keyfigure, key figures>>. Click on the respective link for more detailed information on setting up the key figure and carrying out the available settings.

[.instruction]
Creating key figures in the setup menu:

. Go to *Setup » plentyBI » Key figures*.
. Carry out the settings according to <<table-create-key-figures>>.
. Save (icon:save[set=plenty]) the settings.

[#220]
==== Creating key figures on the dashboard

Do you want to add key figures to a new or existing dashboard? You can conveniently do so on the dashboard itself.

[IMPORTANT]
.Possible settings when creating key figures on the dashboard
====
When creating key figures on the dashboard, it is not possible to set up <<#option-targetvalue, target values>> for those key figures. However, you can later add those settings for the key figure in the *Setup » plentyBI » Key figures* menu.
====

[.instruction]
Creating key figures on the dashboard:

. Go to *plentymarkets logo (Start) » Dashboard*.
. Click on *Edit view* (icon:design_inline_edit[set=plenty]). +
→ The settings menu opens.
. Drag-and-drop an element from the settings menu on the dashboard.

. *Save* (icon:save[set=plenty]) the settings.

[#400]
== Setting up the dashboard

As soon as you have carried out the <<#100, preparatory settings>>, you are ready to set up your dashboard.

The first steps on a new dashboard always consist of placing different areas for display on the dashboard. Then, you fill these areas with data that can be displayed in the form of different elements. You can add and individually position several elements per area.

[#405]
=== Available settings in the editing mode

The dashboard allows you a high degree of flexibility for positioning content and data. This works by intuitively positioning areas for content and elements on the dashboard via drag-and-drop.  Each area and each element can be further edited by clicking on (icon:design_inline_edit[set=plenty]). The following table contains an overview on the functions available in the general editing mode in the upper right corner of the *plentymarkets logo (Start) » Dashboard* menu.

[[table-dashboard-edit-mode]]
[width="100%"]
[cols="1,3"]
|====
|Element |Explanation

| *Edit view* (icon:design_inline_edit[set=plenty])

|====

[#407]
=== Setting up a new dashboard view

In addition to the default view available in the *plentymarkets logo (Start) » Dashboard* menu, you can create and save additional individual views. Depending on how detailed the visualisation of data on your dashboard should be, you can create separate views for different topics and data.

[.instruction]
Setting up a new dashboard view:

. Go to *plentymarkets logo (Start) » Dashboard*.
. Click on *Default view* in the upper right corner.
. Click on *Create new preset*.
. Assign a *Name* for the view.
. Click on *Create view*. +
→ The new view opens. By default, a new view is always a copy of the view that you have created before. Use the <<#405, editing mode>> to delete elements that are not needed and to add further elements to the newly created view.
. *Save* (icon:save[set=plenty]) the settings. +
→ The new view is saved.

In addition, you can determine the visibility of the created views so that only specific users or user roles can access them. Refer to the following chapter for more information.

[#408]
=== Assigning rights for dashboard views

Decide which users should see the default view.  Also, you can determine the visibility of additional views that you have created per user or user role.

Activate the <<#407, editing mode>> (icon:design_inline_edit[set=plenty]) for an already existing dashboard view. Click on *Rights management* to access the settings for users and user roles and decide which dashboard view(s) should be visible for them.

Additional information and an instruction on how to assign rights for users or roles is available on the manual page on <<business-decisions/user-accounts-access#112, user accounts and access>>.

[TIP]
.Navigating between dashboard views
====
As a logged in user, you can easily see which dashboard views you can access and quickly switch between them. In the *plentymarkets logo (Start) » Dashboard* menu, click on the menu icon on the left (icon:bars[role="darkGrey"]). A list of dashboard views that have been made visible to you opens. Click on a dashboard view to open it. The currently opened dashboard view is displayed in blue on the list.
====

[#410]
=== Adding elements to the dashboard

The dashboard offers you a variety of different possibilites for visualising your data. You can use the following types of elements:

* <<#500, Tiles>>
* <<#600, Tables>>
* <<#700, Graphs>>
* <<#800, Rows>>
* <<#900, Notifications>>

The process of placing an element on the dashboard is always the same, regardless of the element type. The following instructions explain how it works.

Click on (icon:settings[role=darkGrey]) to add one or more shortcuts.

| *Link to detailed dashboard view*
| Select which already existing dashboard view to be opened of you open the *Actions* menu (icon:more_vert[set=material, role=blue]) on the tile and select the option *Tile details*. If you select the option *None*, a default dashboard view provided by the system is opened when you clicked on *Tile details*. This dashboard view contains more detailed information on the results and the data of the key figure that has been selected as a basis of the tile.

| *Parameters for detailed view*
| Have you selected an already existing dashboard view for the setting *Link to detailed dashboard view*? Then use this setting to determine how the data included in the dashboard view will be filtered. Click on *Parameter configuration* (icon:settings[role=darkGrey]) to determine one or more criteria. Depending on the key figure represented on the tile, the parameters *Country of delivery*, *User* or *Message tag* are available.
