The world of e-commerce is constantly changing. For you as a seller, it is essential to keep up to date with the numbers and data of your business. Thus, plentymarkets offers you a new dashboard that enables you to access the current key figures of your company and decide if further action is needed. Create your individual dashboard by combining various key figures, statistics, graph types and format options.

Especially when creating your first dashboard, there are some important considerations. Thus, pay close attention to the preparatory settings and follow the instructions in the following chapters carefully:

** <<#200, Creating key figures>>
** <<#300, Assigining user rights>>
** <<#400, Setting up the dashboard>>

[#100]
== Carrying out preparatory settings

A few preparatory steps are necessary before you can set up your individual dashboard. These settings are described in the following chapters.

[#200]
=== Creating key figures

[IMPORTANT]
.Key figure availability depends on plentyBI tariff
====
To create key figures, you need to book a corresponding plentyBI tariff. To do so, go to *plentymarkets Logo (Start) » My account » Contracts*. Different plentyBI tariffs with varying scopes are available for booking in the *Book plentyBI tariff* section. In addition, tariff information is displayed for each key figure in the *Setup » plentyBI » Key figures* menu.
====

To display data on your dashboard, you need to create key figures first.

Key figures essentially allow you to create different data sets. This way, key figures are a basis for the values and data that you can then display and track on your dashboard. Your plentymarkets system provides so-called dimensions for each key figure. Dimensions determine the criteria that are used to group the data included in the key figure.
This way, you can precisely define the conditions for the calculation of each key figure.

//TODO: Beispiel!

You can create key figures in the separate menu provided for this purpose. Alternatively, you can create key figures directly from the dashboard. Both methods are described in the following chapters. 

[IMPORTANT]
.Pay attention to user rights
====
If users without admin access to your plentymarkets system should be allowed to create key figures, assign the <<#300, necessary user rights>> first.
====

[#210]
==== Creating key figures in the setup menu

This method is especially useful if you want to create a high number of key figures at once.
<<table-create-key-figures>> contains a list of available <<#option-keyfigure, key figures>>. Click on the respective link for more detailed information on setting up the key figure and carrying out the available settings.

[.instruction]
Creating key figures in the setup menu:

. Go to *Setup » plentyBI » Key figures*.
. Carry out the settings according to <<table-create-key-figures>>.
. Save icon:save[set=plenty] the settings.

[#220]
==== Creating key figures on the dashboard

Do you want to add key figures to a new or existing dashboard? You can conveniently do so on the dashboard itself.

[IMPORTANT]
.Possible settings when creating key figures on the dashboard
====
When creating key figures on the dashboard, it is not possible to set up <<#option-targetvalue, target values>> for those key figures. However, you can later add those settings for the key figure in the *Setup » plentyBI » Key figures* menu.
====

[.instruction]
Creating key figures on the dashboard:

. Go to *plentymarkets logo (Start) » Dashboard (Beta)*.

[#400]
== Setting up the dashboard

As soon as you have carried out the <<#100, preparatory settings>>, you are ready to set up your dashboard.

The first steps on a new dashboard always consist of placing different areas for display on the dashboard. Then, you fill these areas with data that can be displayed in the form of different elements. You can add and indiviually position several elements per area.

[#405]
=== Available settings in the editing mode

The dashboard allows you a high degree of flexibility for positioning content and data. This works by intuitively positioning areas for content and elements on the dashboard via drag-and-drop. Each area and each element can be further edited by clicking on icon:design_inline_edit[set=plenty]. <<table-dashboard-edit-mode>> contains an overview on the functions available in the general editing mode in the upper right corner of the *plentymarkets logo (Start) » Dashboard (Beta)*.
