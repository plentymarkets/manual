In the constantly changing world of e-commerce, it is essential to keep an overview of the numbers and data of your online business. Thus, plentymarkets offers you a new dashboard that enables you to access the current key figures of your company and decide if further action is needed. Create your individual dashboard by combining various key figures, statistics, graph types and format options. The dashboard allows you to be as flexible and creative as you like.

Especially when creating your first dashboard, there are some important considerations. Thus, pay close attention to the preparatory settings and follow the instructions in the following chapters carefully:

** <<#200, Creating key figures>>
** <<#300, Assigning user rights>>
** <<#400, Setting up the dashboard>>

[#100]
== Carrying out the preparatory settings

Only a few preparatory settings are necessary before you can set up your individual dashboard. These settings are described in the following chapters.

[#200]
=== Creating key figures

[IMPORTANT]
.Key figures available according to plentyBI edition
====
Some key figures can only be used if you have booked the corresponding plentyBI edition. Go to *plentymarkets logo (Start) » My account » Contracts*. Different plentyBI editions with varying scopes are available in the *Book plentyBI edition* section. In addition, more precise information on the required plentyBI edition is displayed for each key figure in the *Setup » plentyBI » Key figures* menu.
====

To display data on your dashboard, you need to create key figures first.

Key figures essentially allow you to create different data sets. This way, key figures are a basis for the values and data that you can then display and track on your dashboard. Your plentymarkets system provides so-called dimensions for each key figure. Dimensions determine the criteria that are used to group the data included in the key figure.
This way, you can precisely define the conditions for the calculation of each key figure.

You can create key figures in the separate menu provided for this purpose. Alternatively, you can create key figures directly from the dashboard. Both methods are described in the following chapters.

[TIP]
.Pay attention to user rights
====
If users without admin access to your plentymarkets system should be allowed to create key figures, assign the <<#300, necessary user rights>> first.
====

[#210]
==== Creating key figures in the setup menu

This method is especially useful if you want to create a high number of key figures at once. <<table-create-key-figures>> contains a list of available <<#option-keyfigure, key figures>>. Click on the respective link for more detailed information on setting up the key figure and carrying out the available settings.

[.instruction]
Creating key figures in the setup menu:

. Go to *Setup » plentyBI » Key figures*.
. Carry out the settings according to <<table-create-key-figures>>.
. Save (icon:save[set=plenty]) the settings.

[#220]
==== Creating key figures on the dashboard

Do you want to add key figures to a new or existing dashboard? You can conveniently do so on the dashboard itself.

[IMPORTANT]
.Possible settings when creating key figures on the dashboard
====
When creating key figures on the dashboard, it is not possible to set up <<#option-targetvalue, target values>> for those key figures. However, you can later add those settings for the key figure in the *Setup » plentyBI » Key figures* menu.
====

[.instruction]
Creating key figures on the dashboard:

. Go to *plentymarkets Logo (Start) » Dashboard*.
. Click on *Edit view* (icon:design_inline_edit[set=plenty]). +
→ The settings menu opens.
. Drag-and-drop an element from the settings menu on the dashboard.
. Move the cursor over the element and click on (icon:design_inline_edit[set=plenty]). +
→ The settings menu for the element opens.

[#300]
=== Assigning user rights

When working with key figures, you should decide which of your employees should be allowed to view which key figures. Users with admin access to your plentymarkets system can view all key figures and create new key figures by default.
Users with a *Back end* account have to be assigned those rights by a user with an admin account.

Proceed as described below to determine which key figures should be visible for users.

[.instruction]
Assigning rights for viewing key figures:

. Go to *Setup » Settings » User » Rights » User*. +
→ The overview opens. +
*_Optional:_* In the filter settings on the left, enter an ID or a name to limit the search results.
. Click on *Search* (icon:search[role="blue"]). +
→ The user accounts that correspond to the search criteria are displayed. +
*_Tip:_* Accounts that are greyed out have admin rights.

*_Tip:_* Accounts that are greyed out have admin rights.
. Click on the appropriate account.
. In the *plentyBI* area, activate the option *Key figures*.
. *Save* (icon:save[set=plenty]) the settings.

[#400]
== Setting up the dashboard

As soon as you have carried out the <<#100, preparatory settings>>, you are ready to set up your dashboard.

The first steps on a new dashboard always consist of placing different areas for display on the dashboard. Then, you fill these areas with data that can be displayed in the form of different elements. You can add and individually position several elements per area.

[#405]
=== Available settings in the editing mode

The dashboard allows you a high degree of flexibility for positioning content and data. This works by intuitively positioning areas for content and elements on the dashboard via drag-and-drop.  Each area and each element can be further edited by clicking on (icon:design_inline_edit[set=plenty]). The following table contains an overview on the functions available in the general editing mode in the upper right corner of the *plentymarkets logo (Start) » Dashboard* menu.

[[table-dashboard-edit-mode]]
[width="100%"]
[cols="1,3"]
|====
|Element |Explanation

| *Edit view* (icon:design_inline_edit[set=plenty])
| Opens the dashboard for editing.

| *Undo* (icon:reply[role=darkGrey])
| Undoes the last change, unless this change has already been saved.

| *Redo* (icon:share[role=darkGrey])
| Restores the previously undone change.

| *Default view*
| This area displays the dashboard view that is currently opened. Click on icon:sort-down[role=darkGrey] to switch to another view or to <<#407, create a new view>>.

| *Restore previously saved state* (icon:reset[set=plenty])
| Resets the dashboard to the state that was last saved.

| *Save* (icon:save[set=plenty])
| Saves the changes made to the dashboard.

| *Close* (icon:close[set=plenty])
| Closes the editing mode. In case of unsaved changes, a dialogue is displayed.

|====

[#407]
=== Setting up a new dashboard view

In addition to the default view available in the *plentymarkets logo (Start) » Dashboard* menu, you can create and save additional individual views. Depending on how detailed the visualisation of data on your dashboard should be, you can create separate views for different topics and data.

[.instruction]
Setting up a new dashboard view:

. Go to *plentymarkets Logo (Start) » Dashboard*.
. Click on *Default view* in the upper right corner.
. Click on *Create new preset*.
. Assign a *Name* for the view.
. Click on *Create view*. +
→ The new view opens. By default, a new view is always a copy of the view that you have created before. Use the <<#405, editing mode>> to delete elements that are not needed and to add further elements to the newly created view.
. *Save* (icon:save[set=plenty]) the settings. +
→ The new view is saved.

In addition, you can determine the visibility of the created views so that only specific users or user roles can access them. Refer to the following chapter for more information.

[#408]
=== Assigning rights for dashboard views

Decide which users should see the default view.  Also, you can determine the visibility of additional views that you have created per user or user role.

Activate the <<#407, editing mode>> (icon:design_inline_edit[set=plenty]) for an already existing dashboard view. Click on *Rights management* to access the settings for users and user roles and decide which dashboard view(s) should be visible for them.

Additional information and an instruction on how to assign rights for users or roles is available on the manual page on <<business-decisions/user-accounts-access#112, user accounts and access>>.

[TIP]
.Navigating between dashboard views
====
As a logged in user, you can easily see which dashboard views you can access and quickly switch between them. In the *plentymarkets logo (Start) » Dashboard* menu, click on the menu icon on the left (icon:bars[role="darkGrey"]). A list of dashboard views that have been made visible to you opens. Click on a dashboard view to open it. The currently opened dashboard view is displayed in blue on the list.
====

[#410]
=== Adding elements to the dashboard

The dashboard offers you a variety of different possibilites for visualising your data. You can use the following types of elements:

* <<#500, Tiles>>
* <<#600, Tables>>
* <<#700, Graphs>>
* <<#800, Rows>>
* <<#900, Notifications>>

The process of placing an element on the dashboard is always the same, regardless of the element type. The following instructions explain how it works.

[.instruction]
Placing areas and elements on the dashboard:

. Move the cursor over the element and click on *Edit* (icon:design_inline_edit[set=plenty]). +
→ The settings menu opens. +
→ The possible elements for the area are displayed.
. Select an element from the settings menu and drag-and-drop it within the area on the dashboard.
. *Save* (icon:save[set=plenty]) the settings.

[TIP]
.Collapse areas on the dashboard
====
Have you placed a lot of areas on your dashboard and want to keep the overview? The option *Collapse area* is available for each area. Activate this option to collapse the area on the dashboard by default. Click on (icon:chevron-down[role="darkGrey"]) to open the area and see the data displayed within whenever needed.
====

The following chapters describe how to use the different elements and which settings are possible for each element.

[#500]
=== Setting up tiles

Tiles are simple square areas. Data in tiles is displayed exclusively as text and numbers. You can select different colours and settings for time intervals and target values.

First, add an element of the type *Tile* to the dashboard. Then, proceed as described below to carry out individual settings for the tile.

The link has to include everything displayed in the URL of the menu after the *terra* component. + *_Example:_* If the order overview should be opened when clicking on the button, enter the link */order/order-search*. +
External link: Enter the complete link to the external page, beginning with *http://*. +
*_Tip:_* Click on (icon:plus[role="green"]) to save further conditions for different colours.

| *Custom shortcuts*
| Use this setting to add a customised option to the *Actions* menu (icon:ellipsis-h[rotate=90]) on the tile. You can also determine conditions that have to be fulfilled for the option to be displayed, and decide what happens if users click on the option. +
Click on (icon:settings[role=darkGrey]) to add one or more shortcuts.

| *Link to detailed dashboard view*
| Select which already existing dashboard view should be opened when users click on the *Actions* menu (icon:ellipsis-h[rotate=90]) on the tile and select the option *Tile details*. If you select the option *None*, a default dashboard view provided by the system is opened when you clicked on *Tile details*. This dashboard view contains more detailed information on the results and the data of the key figure that has been selected as a basis of the tile.

=== Setting up graphs

Graphs allow you to visualise data on your dashboard in an even clearer way. The following types of graphs are available:

* <<#710, Pie chart>>
* <<#720, Bar chart>>
* <<#725, Simple bar chart>>
* <<#720, Line graph>>
* <<#730, Heat map>>
* <<#740, Progress chart>>
* <<#745, Gauge chart>>

The following chapters explain how to place the different types of graphs on your dashboard and which settings are available for each type.

In addition, there are a few useful additional functions available for graphs, regardless of the type. For example, you can download graphs as images or easily access the data displayed in the graph directly from the dashboard. Refer to the chapter <<#750, Using additional functions for graphs>> for more information.

==== Bar chart and line graph

Bar charts and line graphs are also commonly used for visualising data. They are particularly suited for clear visualisations of how values develop over time. This is why you can select several key figures to display them in those types of graphs.

The available settings for bar charts and line graphs are mostly identical. Thus, they are both described in this chapter. Exceptions and limited availabilities are clearly pointed out in the following explanations.

First, add an element of the type *Bar chart* or *Line graph* to the dashboard. Then, proceed as described below to carry out individual settings for the graphs.

|Setting |Explanation

| *Bar chart configuration templates* / *Line graph configuration templates*
| Click on this button to use a template for the chart or graph provided by the system. This way, the chart or graph displays the selected data so you do not have to select data manually in additional steps.

| *Key figures and period*
| Use the search field to enter the name of the key figure configuration and select the entries to display the key figures in the chart or graph. Alternatively, click on *Create new key figure* (icon:plus[role="green"]) to create a new key figure.

| *Time interval*
| This setting narrows down the values of the selected *Period*. Thus, the time interval always has to be shorter than the selected *Period*. +
*_Example:_* If you have selected the current month as *Period* and the option *Week* as *Time interval*, the values for each completed week of the current month will be displayed as separate bar or graph.

| *Additional time interval*
| This setting displays additional buttons on the top right of the bar chart or line graph. These buttons allow you to filter the data displayed in the graph according to additional time intervals. This way, you can easily switch between different time intervals. Activate one or more of the options *Day*, *Month*, *Quarter* or *Year*. +
*_Example:_* If you have previously selected the current month for the option *Time interval*, you can use the additional time interval to display buttons that display the data filtered by days or weeks when you click on them.

| *Click on bar for precise time interval* (only available for bar charts)
| Activate this option to display the data of the bar chart for the next smaller time interval. You can click on the bar repeatedly, until the smallest time interval (days) has been reached. Use the button *Reset interval* on the top right of the diagram to quickly return to the original display of data.

| *Number of columns*
| Select how many units of the selected time interval should be displayed in the graph or chart. The starting point depends on the selected time period.

| *Activate zoom*
| Activate this option to enable the zoom function for the graph or chart. In addition, determine a *Start value* to which the zoom should be set by default whenever the dashboard is opened. If you access the dashboard later, a blue bar with a control element will be displayed. Use this to zoom in and out of the graph or chart to see more detailed data, if needed.

| *Display average line* (only available for bar charts)
| Activate this option to display a line that represents the average values in addition to the bars. The average values are calculated from the results of the key figures that have been selected for display in the chart. + 
*_Note:_* This option is only available if you have selected more than one key figure to be displayed in the bar chart.

| *Display horizontally* (only available for bar charts)
| Activate this option to rotate the bar chart by 90 degrees. This automatically inverts the axes of the the bar chart.
