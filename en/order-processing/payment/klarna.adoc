:description: Payment in plentymarkets: Set up the interface to Klarna in your plentymarkets system.
:position: 13

Klarna is Europe's leading provider for payment on invoice in online business. When you integrate Klarna, you can offer your customers the possibility of using an invoice as the payment method - and you can do so without risk for your customers or for your online store. Both payment methods, **<<order-processing/payment/klarna#20, Klarna invoice>>** and **<<order-processing/payment/klarna#30, Klarna account>>**, are only available for private customers in Germany, Austria and the Netherlands. Therefore, permit these payment methods only in **<<crm/managing-customer-data#100, customer classes>>** for private customers.

[#10]
==  Important notes

This chapter provides you with important information about integrating the payment provider in plentymarkets. If all of the settings were carried out correctly, then you can transfer information about shipped orders, (partial) returns and cancellations from plentymarkets to Klarna. The Klarna invoice will be saved directly in the order once the outgoing items have been booked.

Please pay attention to a few important notes in order to make processing Klarna orders as easy as possible:

*  You should always book the outgoing items and **<<order-processing/payment/klarna#100, ship>>** the items at the same time. This is because the 14 day payment deadline begins for your customer when the outgoing items are booked.
*  Klarna should be notified of **<<order-processing/payment/klarna#100, returns>>** as soon as possible in order to avoid dunning letters.
*  If the customer selects Klarna invoice as the payment method, then be sure to either send them an invoice via email or included in the package, depending on your own **<<order-processing/payment/klarna#100, workflow>>**. +
If the customer selects Klarna account, then do not send them an invoice. Klarna will group together all of the invoices and send the customer one multi-invoice at the end of the month.
*  If the customer **<<order-processing/payment/klarna#100, cancels his or her order>>**, then give it the status **cancelled** as soon as possible so that the shopping cart value will no longer be reserved for the customer.

===  Payment on invoice

With **Klarna invoice**, your customers are able to shop easily because they only have to enter a few nonsensitive pieces of information instead of going through tedious registration processes. In addition, the customers only pay after receiving the items which makes shopping safer for them. In a survey that was carried out by the market research institute TNS Infratest, 59% of people who are rather inactive online shoppers stated the reason for this being that they prefer to pay after they have received the items. For further information about payment on invoice by Klarna, refer to the **link:https://klarna.com/buy-klarna/our-services/klarna-invoice[Klarna invoice^]** page.

[.subhead]
Order process

Once the order has been completed, the order will be sent to Klarna. As soon as Klarna gives positive feedback, the order will be saved. The customer will receive a confirmation message. If an error occurs or Klarna rejects the payment request, the order will not be saved. The customer will receive an error message in the order overview.

[#30]
===  Klarna account

The payment method **Klarna account** allows your customers to pay for their purchased items with monthly instalments. If you configure your online store layout appropriately, a note concerning <<order-processing/payment/klarna#180, **instalment prices**>> will be displayed in the **shopping cart/order process** as well as in the **item details**. The instalment price will automatically be calculated according to the invoice amount. This price will then be displayed in the order process. For further information about the payment Klarna account, refer to the **link:https://klarna.com/buy-klarna/our-services/klarna-account[Klarna account^]** page.

==  Editing an order coming from Klarna

It is still possible to edit an order coming from Klarna until the outgoing items have been booked, e.g. reducing item quantity. It is also possible to delete items. The invoice amount will then be adjusted. You can only reduce the quantity, not increase it. You may not add further items to an existing order. Since no final invoice was created yet, it is not a problem to delete a Klarna order before the respective outgoing items are booked.

[.instruction]
Deleting an order:

. Go to **Orders » Edit orders**.
. Open the Klarna order. +
→ The **Overview** tab will open.
. Click on **Delete**. +
→ The order will be deleted.

[#130]
==  Shipping items

Ship the items immediately since the customer's period of payment, which is 14 days, starts with the activation of the Klarna invoice. Note that the items may only be sent to the address that appears on the Klarna invoice. As soon as the outgoing items are booked, the invoice will be issued.

[IMPORTANT]
.Klarna orders will not be transferred to DHL Fulfillment
====
Currently, it is not possible to transfer orders that are paid with Klarna to <<order-processing/fulfilment/preparing-the-shipment#4800, **DHL Fulfillment**>>. Only orders with a valid invoice can be transferred to DHL Fulfillment. However, Klarna only transmits the invoice to plentymarkets after outgoing items have been booked.
====

[#140]
===  Generating the invoice

As soon as the shipping confirmation was sent to Klarna or as soon as the outgoing items are booked, the system will create a Klarna invoice with the current data. The invoice will be made available as a PDF document via the **invoice number** link (image 4) or in the order's **Receipts** tab. It can be printed out and enclosed in the package. Once the outgoing items have been booked, the invoice can also be attached to an email and automatically sent to the customer with the help of an event procedure.

[IMPORTANT]
.The invoice address cannot be changed
====
Please note that the (invoice) address cannot be changed. The invoice may not be deleted when the order is in status 7 (**outgoing items booked**).
====

[.instruction]
Downloading, printing and enclosing the invoice:

.  In order to download the invoice, click on the invoice link directly in the **order overview** (image 4). Or open the order and click on the invoice link in the **Receipts** tab (image 5).
.  Save the invoice and print it out afterwards.
.  Put the invoice into the package.

[#150]
===  Partial delivery

If the order changes or if one of the items is no longer available, then you can edit the items in the order. **<<order-processing/payment/klarna#120, Edit the order>>** before booking the outgoing items.

[#160]
===  Complete delivery

If an item is currently not available but it has been reordered, then wait for the reorder to arrive before booking the outgoing items.

[#170]
===  Pending orders

Pending orders are designated with **status 3** in the order overview.

In order to boost the rate of acceptance, orders that cannot be directly approved by Klarna will receive the status **Pending**. You can see these orders within the order overview. They are designated with **status 3** (image 6). Klarna will manually check the pending orders within the next few hours (maximum 24 hours). An integrated Cronjob is used to query the status of these orders at Klarna every hour. +
If the order is manually accepted during this process, then it will appear as a normal order. If the order is rejected, then it will be displayed as rejected. You can then offer the customer a different payment method.

.pending order
image::order-processing/payment/assets/EN-Payment-Methods-Klarna-06.png[]
The email that you use to offer the customer a different payment method should include a link to the checkout (template variable: [URL_Checkout]). Using this link, the customer will be able to select another payment method for the order.

[#180]
==  Customising the template for instalment purchases

In order to display the instalment price on the item's page and in the list of items, the template **ItemViewSingleItem** has to be customised. You can also integrate the Klarna account logo into the display. For the Klarna logo, refer to the link:https://developers.klarna.com/en/se+php/kco-v2/logos[**Klarna Developer Portal**^].

[.instruction]
Customising the template for instalment purchases:

. Go to **CMS » Web design**.
. Open the folder **Layout » ItemView**.
. Click on the template **ItemViewSingleItem**.
. Insert the code example into the template.
. Replace the entry **SHOP-ID** with SHOP-ID that you received from Klarna. +
→ The SHOP-ID is also used in the plentymarkets back end for setting up the payment methods.
. **Save** the settings.
