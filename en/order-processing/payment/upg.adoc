[IMPORTANT]
.UPG and store design
====
Note that the following conditions must be met before integrating UPG successfully in plentymarkets:

* Use of the standard design Callisto (Version 2 or higher)

Payment process

Depending on which payment method is selected, customers will either have to enter their details into an iframe or they will be redirected to a UPG page after confirming their order. If customers are redirected, they will need to enter their details for the selected payment method there. Once customers have entered the data and confirmed the payment, they will be directed back to your online store. Customers are currently redirected if they select the payment methods Sofortbanking or PayPal (as of 1st June 2016).

. Open the UPG order.  +
→ The **Overview** tab will open.
