== Activating payment methods

In addition to the payment method PayPal PLUS which you activate in the <<order-processing/payment/managing-payment-methods#20, System » Orders » Payment » Payment methods>> menu, additional payment methods such as credit card or debit are available. However, the payment methods debit and purchase on invoice can only be used if Germany is selected as the country of delivery. Set up and activate the desired <<order-processing/payment/managing-payment-methods#10, payment methods>> in your plentymarkets system. To display the logos of additional payment methods, upload the logos directly in the settings of the payment method with a maximum size of 100 x 25 px. In addition, check the settings for *Permitted payment methods* in the <<order-processing/payment/managing-payment-methods#30, customer classes>> and for *Blocked payment methods* in the <<order-processing/fulfilment/preparing-the-shipment#1000, shipping profiles>>.

[IMPORTANT]
.Limitations for purchase on invoice
====
Purchase on invoice via PayPal PLUS is not available if the purchase value is less than 1.50 EUR or greater than 1,500.00 EUR. Furthermore, digital media cannot be purchased on invoice due to the impossibility of return.

== Displaying PayPal PLUS in the online store

This section explains how to add PayPal PLUS to the individual order process in plentymarkets. This is done in several steps. First, PayPal PLUS is inserted in a category of the type *Container*.

[WARNING]
.No changes to the active design
====
Do not make changes to your active design. Before making changes to the design, make a backup copy so that you can restore the original state of the design.
====

[IMPORTANT]
.Calculating the order total
====
PayPal and plentymarkets use a different number of decimal places when calculating prices. As such, there may be slight rounding differences in the order total calculated by plentymarkets and PayPal. These differences are automatically settled in the background ensuring that the totals match in plentymarkets and PayPal. This is either done with a credit note or with an item to balance out the difference.

== Customising the invoice template for PayPal PLUS orders

If you use PayPal PLUS and you generate invoices for the orders that are paid for with PayPal PLUS invoices, then make sure to display PayPal's bank details on the invoice rather than your own bank details. This is done automatically with a payment instruction. Proceed as described below to use your own <<order-processing/orders/order-documents#170, PDF template>>.

[IMPORTANT]
.Respect the payment instruction width
====
In order to display the bank details of PayPal PLUS correctly on your invoice, save a width of 120 millimetres for the payment instruction in the *System » Client » Select client » Locations » Select location » Documents » Invoice* menu.
====

[.instruction]
Using own PDF template:

. Go to *System » Client » Select client » Locations » Select location » Documents » Invoice*.
. Click on the *PDF template* tab.
. Click on the *New template* tab.
. Select *PayPal PLUS* from the drop-down menu to save the template for PayPal PLUS.
. Use the *File* area to select the PDF file on your computer.
. Click on *Open*.
. *Save* the settings. +
→ The PDF file will be uploaded and listed in the *Templates* tab.

Before sending invoices to customers, find out whether customers already receive invoices from PayPal. In other words, make sure the customer does not receive 2 invoices.
