[WARNING]
.Deliveries paid for with an invoice to countries others than Germany
====
As for now, arvato infoscore provides credit ratings for Germany only. However, you can still use the payment methods invoice and debit for other countries. On the one hand, German customers with a positive credit rating can use an invoice to pay for shipments going to foreign countries. On the other hand, if you activated arvato infoscore, then all customers who provide an invoice address outside of Germany will be rejected without a credit rating being carried out.

== FAQ

[.instruction]
I activated the credit rating. All customers from outside of Germany receive a message during the order process that the payment methods invoice and debit are not possible. Why is that?

[.indented]
arvato infoscore provides credit ratings for Germany only. This is why these payment methods are denied to all other customers. However, it is possible for a customer to have his or her order delivered to an address outside of Germany. In order to allow customers from other countries to purchase on invoice, the module has to be deactivated.[.instruction]
During the last accounting cycle, 35 customers ordered items on invoice but a notably higher number of queries have been billed. Has there been a mistake?

[.indented]
You have to keep in mind that some customers select **invoice** as their payment method and log in to the store, but then abort the purchase and do not send their order. Or, some customers may decide to pay with a different payment method after all. +
Furthermore, you can manually check the credit rating for customers who selected other payment methods. Be sure to tell your employees that every single query is subject to costs and will be added to your monthly service bill.[.instruction]
What happens if a customer slightly modifies his or her address due to the error message?

[.indented]
The payment methods invoice and debit are always tied to a certain amount of risk. We recommend that all our customers define a maximum invoice amount when applying the settings for this interface. According to arvato infoscore, slight changes of the name and the address will not have an influence on the result of the credit rating. However, if the modification is quite large and theoretically two different people could be meant, arvato infoscore will provide a report with reservation. In these cases, it is best to change the payment method to a different, more secure method. Whenever the difference is very big, arvato may not provide a report for data security reasons. This is because the chance of it being two different people is too high!
