[#60]
== Customising the invoice template for Paymorrow orders

If you use Paymorrow and you generate invoices for the orders that are paid for with Paymorrow invoices, then make sure to display Paymorrow's bank details on the invoice rather than your own bank details. This is done automatically with a payment instruction. Proceed as described below to use your own **<<order-processing/orders/order-documents#170, PDF template>>**.

[IMPORTANT]
.Respect the payment instruction width
====
In order to display the bank details of Paymorrow correctly on your invoice, save a width of 120 millimetres for the payment instruction in the **System » Client » Select client » Locations » Select location » Documents » Invoice** menu.
====

[.instruction]
Using own PDF template:

. Go to **System » Client » Select client » Locations » Select location » Documents » Invoice**.
. Click on the **PDF template** tab.
. Click on the **New template** tab.
. Select **Paymorrow** from the drop-down menu to save the template for Paymorrow.
. Use the **File** area to select the PDF file on your computer.
. Click on **Open**.
. **Save** the settings. +
→ The PDF file will be uploaded and listed in the **Templates** tab.

Before sending invoices to customers, find out whether customers already receive invoices from Paymorrow. In other words, make sure the customer does not receive 2 invoices.

[#70]
== Automatically sending invoices

Set up event procedures to inform Paymorrow of outgoing items, credit notes and cancellations. For this to work correctly, the documents need to be created in the order's **Receipts** tab. Set up an <<basics/automation/event-procedures#, **event procedure**>> to automatically send invoices to Paymorrow and to report outgoing items to Paymorrow.

[WARNING]
.Paymorrow only
====
Only set up the event procedures for the payment method Paymorrow. Otherwise unintended messages could be triggered. If you select multiple payment methods in the **filter** tab, then the message that was triggered for Paymorrow will also be sent to all of the other payment providers that were activated.

==  Checking the order status

At the end of the order process, your customer will receive the information that you will now process the order. A few examples follow, which provide explanations of the various order statuses.

[#110]
===  Order process completed and payment successful through Paymorrow

The customer has completed the order and has initiated payment through Paymorrow. The order is now in **status 5** (cleared for shipping). The items can be shipped. Once Paymorrow receives the invoice, the payment deadline is 30 days. Your customer must pay the invoice to Paymorrow within this time period.

Once a week (providing that sales figures are generated), you will receive an account statement via email, which includes the following documents:

*  Accounting confirmation of individual items (Excel file)
*  Cancellations of individual items (Excel file)
*  Accounting (PDF file)
*  Invoice of your Paymorrow fees (PDF file)

[#120]
===  Paymorrow payment method rejected

The payment method Paymorrow was rejected. The order overview will display the message **No payments** under **Incoming payment**.

[#130]
===  Order value limits were not observed (minimum or maximum)

In this case, the payment method Paymorrow cannot be selected. One of the limits that was set for orders was not observed. The permitted range for orders will be shown. In the example (image 1), the minimum was set to 20 Euro and the maximum was set to 20,000 Euro.
