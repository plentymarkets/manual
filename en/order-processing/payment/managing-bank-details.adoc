== Displaying own bank details in the online store

The category **Bank details** is used for displaying your bank details in the online store. A customer requires your bank details when paying with the payment method cash in advance, for example. The bank details will be displayed during the order process when the customer selects the payment method cash in advance or invoice. The information will also be displayed in the **order history** once the order has been completed. The category **Bank details** can contain information about several bank accounts in different countries.

[#30]
=== Customising the Bank details category

Proceed as follows to customise the **Bank details** category.

[.instruction]
Customising the category:

. Go to **Item » Categories**.
. Open the design's folder, e.g. the folder for Callisto Light 3.
. Open the category **Bank details**.
. Click on the **Description 1** tab.

[#50]
=== Displaying the bank details in the order history

Carry out the same settings for the payment method Invoice to display the bank details in the **order history** whenever an order is completed. If you activated the option **Show designated use**, then the order ID will be displayed in the **order history** along with the bank details.

[#60]
=== Displaying country-specific bank details

You can use an IF query to only show the bank details for the country of delivery. In other words, a buyer in Germany would only see the German account details and a customer in Switzerland would only see the Swiss account details. You need the template variable **$CustomerShippingCountry** for this. It only displays the corresponding content if the particular country of delivery was selected. You can find the country IDs under **Settings » Orders » Shipping » Shipping options** in the **Countries of delivery** tab. Insert the following code into the **<<order-processing/payment/managing-bank-details#30, Bank details >>** category. Add further countries of delivery with the respective ID, if needed.

== Saving the customer's bank details

You can save the customer's bank details in the **Settings** tab of a customer's data record or delete them again as needed. Bank details are needed, e.g. for the payment method **<<order-processing/payment/managing-payment-methods#40, debit >>**. There is also an **<<order-processing/payment/managing-payments#10, import function >>** for bank details in plentymarkets. Contact a legal adviser for information about the current laws in your own country as well as in other countries of delivery.

[IMPORTANT]
.Pay attention to subscription orders
====
Note that the bank details saved here will also be used for subscription orders with the payment method **Debit**. If you delete bank details that are connected to such a subscription order, then the payment method in the **<<order-processing/orders/scheduler#, scheduler  >>** will be changed to the <<order-processing/payment/managing-payment-methods#25, **default payment method** >> for the particular client (store). The subscription order will then no longer be paid for as an automatic bank transfer. In such a case, only delete the bank details if absolutely necessary. If possible, save new bank details for the customer.
====

[#70]
== Setting up EBICS

EBICS (Electronic Banking Internet Communication Standard) is a transmission protocol for banking information for usage by banking clients. With the help of the standardised EBICS procedure, retrieving payments has become even easier. EBICS is completely integrated in plentymarkets. No third party providers are required.

For communication via EBICS, your sales figures are saved on the bank server in a file, comparable to bank statements. This file is imported in your plentymarkets system and the sales figures are booked in plentymarkets. The linked EBICS account can be seen as a combined account of several bank accounts. A file with the sales figures of an EBICS account is generated daily. This file can be retrieved at night and all incoming payments are available the next morning. Besides, multiple interim transaction report files are generated daily which can be retrieved to book interim transaction reports in your plentymarkets system.

[#80]
=== Applying for an EBICS account at your bank

First, apply for an EBICS account at your bank. You will receive documents from your bank, which you will have to fill in and send back afterwards. The following details for EBICS have to be entered in the form.

[IMPORTANT]
.Existing EBICS accounts
====
Do not set up already existing EBICS accounts in plentymarkets. Multiple users (participants) can be listed in an EBICS account. If you already hold an account, then apply for a new one (techn. user is also possible). Only use this account for plentymarkets.
====

[#90]
==== Account numbers

Enter the account numbers for the accounts that you would like sales figures to be retrieved and booked into plentymarkets from. Entering account numbers is optional. This is because the retrieval is technically based on the user data. For further information about entering or not entering of account numbers refer to table 4.

[IMPORTANT]
.Only save business accounts
====
There is currently no option in plentymarkets for setting up accounts individually for EBICS retrieval. This means that payment transactions can only be retrieved globally by the plentymarkets system for all accounts saved. This includes e.g. payment transactions on your private account as well, if this account was saved. For this reason, only save the account numbers of your business accounts.
====

[WARNING]
.One account for several users
====
If several different users all refer to the same account (some banks manage multiple accounts together), then problems may occur if retrieval is carried out simultaneously. This is true even if the users work with different plentymarkets systems. There is currently no solution to prevent this.
====

[#100]
==== Provision of bank statements

Provisioning of bank statements can either be done based on the date of the bookkeeping entry or based on bank statements.

.provision of bank statements
[cols="a,a"]
|====
|Setting |Explanation

|**Based on date of bookkeeping entry**
|A fictitious, consecutive number is included. This setting is selected by default.

|**Based on bank statements**
|An effective bank statement number is included. Provided that automatic bank statement retrieval is carried out on a daily basis.
|====

[#110]
==== Participants

When setting up your accounts for EBICS, you create one or more **<<basics/working-with-plentymarkets/manage-users#10, users >>** for your accounts. EBICS users are called participants (German: Teilnehmer). You can create participants including different order types. One of these participants has to be saved in the plentymarkets system with the **participant ID** that you received from your bank.

plentymarkets only requires one participant, e.g. a user account with the lowest rights, in order to carry out the EBICS payment retrieval. Only one participant may be set up per EBICS account.

[#120]
==== Order type

Plentymarkets needs the following order types (explanation in the following table) in order to successfully retrieve the transactions on your EBICS account. Pay attention to the notes about order and signature types given in your bank's forms.

.order and signature types
[cols="a,a"]
|====
|Type |Explanation

|**STA**
|Statement of account **MT940** or **CAMT053**. **<<order-processing/payment/managing-bank-details#180, Retrieval of the transactions >>** at the end of the day.

|**VMK**
|Interim transaction report **MT942** or **CAMT052**. Depending on the respective bank, interim transaction reports are created and made ready for retrieval several times a day. This **<<order-processing/payment/managing-bank-details#190, information >>** is optional for plentymarkets.

|**EU Type "T"**
|Signature type that provides authorisation exclusively for the retrieval of transaction data.
|====

[#130]
=== Booking the EBICS module in the Service center

Before you can use EBICS, you will need to activate either the **Daily EBICS query** module or the **Hourly EBICS query** module. Go to **Start » plentymarkets account » Service Center** to do so. Select the corresponding plentymarkets system, click on the **Contract** tab and scroll down to the **Add-Ons** area. Click on this area to open a window that shows the available modules. Click on **Book** to use the module. Otherwise, the **EBICS** menu will not be visible.

[#140]
=== Adding a new EBICS account in plentymarkets

After your bank accounts have been set up for EBICS, you will receive a letter from your bank. This letter will include the data that you will have to save in plentymarkets in order to set up EBICS there.

.adding a new EBICS account
image::order-processing/payment/assets/EN-Bank-Details-EBICS-New-account.png[]

[IMPORTANT]
.Domain transfer
====
Save the basic settings again after carrying out a **<<basics/start/plentymarkets-account/service-center/domain#, domain transfer  >>**. This will update the EBICS data.
====

[.instruction]
Carrying out the EBICS account settings:

[cols="a,a"]
|====
|Setting |Explanation

2+|Menu bar

|**Save**
|Save the entered data. The actual EBICS account will be created in the EBICS tool on the plentymarkets E-Banking server and will receive an ID.  +
**__Important__**: Click on **Save** every time that data is changed. This will transfer the data to the EBICS tool.

|**Retrieve status**
|Generate an entry in the **API log**. This entry provides information about the current status of the account.  +
**__Important__**: A **<<order-processing/payment/managing-bank-details#4, SOAP account >>** must be created before the status can be retrieved.

|**INI letter**
|Electronically transfer the INI key values to the bank. It is only possible to retrieve the INI letter data if the account is activated.  +
**__Note__**: The INI letter file in PDF format, which includes the details for activation, will only be available a certain amount of time after the account was created. The system needs this time to generate the data. The INI letter will be available in PDF format the next day (at the latest after 24 hours). Wait until the file is available before clicking on **INI letter**. The INI letter file that was generated can be found under **Orders » Document archive**.  +
**__Important__**: The bank will only keep the INI letter data available for 4 - 10 days. As such, submit the signed INI letter document to your bank immediately.

|**Initialise account**
|Electronically transfer the INI data to the bank. The data will be transferred to the bank automatically when creating a new EBICS account. If the INI letter data is no longer available, then use this function to send the INI data again.  +
**__Important__**: Consult your bank before carrying out this function. It can be used if your bank wants you to transfer HPB, HIA or INI.

|**Open log**
|Open the API log and display the EBICS process overview. To access the log, select the option **electronic banking** from the **API name** drop-down menu and click on **Search**.

2+|Basic settings

|**Account ID**
|Every account that is entered in the **Account numbers** field will have its own ID. The account ID will be displayed here after **saving** the settings.

|**Account name**
|Enter the EBICS account name. A submenu with this name will be created under **EBICS**.

|**User: First name**
|Enter the participant's first name.

|**User: Surname**
|Enter the participant's surname.

|**Bank participant ID**
|Enter the parameter ID that you received from your bank.

|**Bank customer ID**
|Enter the bank customer ID that you received from your bank.

|**Bank host name**
|Enter the server ID of the bank or EBICS bank name.

|**Bank parameters**
|Enter the parameter ID that you received from your bank.

|**EBICS URL**
|Enter the URL of the bank's EBICS interface. The URL has to start with **http://** or **https://**.

|**Account synchronisation**
|Activate or deactivate EBICS access.  +
**__Important__**: The keys are only generated and the retrievals are carried out if the account is activated.

|**Interim transaction report**
|**Do not retrieve** = Interim transaction reports will not be retrieved.  +
**MT942** = Retrieves the interim transaction report in SWIFT format.  +
**CAMT052** = Retrieves the interim transaction report in XML format.  +
Discrepancies can occur between interim transaction reports and booked transactions, since many banks use different sets of coding for the characters in their transaction files. These cannot be synchronised with each other in plentymarkets. In other words, interim transaction reports and bookings cannot be compared and assigned to each other (e.g. Deutsche Bank).  +
**__Important__**: You have to activate the statement of account in order for interim transaction reports to be confirmed. For further information, refer to **<<order-processing/payment/managing-bank-details#190, Retrieval times >>**.

|**Statement of account**
|**Do not retrieve** = Statement of account will not be retrieved.  +
**MT942** = Retrieves the statement of account in SWIFT format.  +
**CAMT052** = Retrieves the statement of account in XML format.

|**Account numbers**
|Enter account numbers to retrieve only these numbers, even if you had saved further account numbers for EBICS with your bank.  +
**__Important__**: In order to avoid malfunctions, every account number has to be entered exactly like it was saved for the EBICS retrieval at the corresponding bank. Leave the fields blank if you are not sure what the correct account number is (with or without a leading zero, etc.). Retrieval is not possible if the account number is entered incorrectly.  +
Do not enter account numbers to retrieve all account numbers saved for EBICS.

|**IBAN**
|Same as described above. Here for IBAN entries.
|====

[IMPORTANT]
.Contact your bank before making changes
====
Get in contact with your bank before making changes. For example, if you want to use the new CAMT formats, then ask your bank whether or not this format is supported and have the format activated. Then make any necessary changes to the **basic settings** and interim transaction report as described here.

If an account was reset and your bank needs new keys, then we recommend that you set up the EBICS account again in plentymarkets. This way new keys will be generated.
====

[#160]
=== Defining commercial transactions

For importing and assigning commercial transactions automatically, activate the required commercial transactions under **Domestic payments**, **SEPA payments** and **Foreign business allocation**. The following standard commercial transactions will be imported even if you did not select any of the options:

* 020 - **Bank transfer**
* 051 - **Transfer credit note**
* 104 - **SEPA Direct Debit** (single booking - debit, B2B)
* 105 - **SEPA Direct Debit** (single booking - debit, Core)
* 166 - **SEPA Credit Transfer** (single booking - credit)

You need to activate the standard commercial transactions if you select other commercial transactions as well. Only those that were previously selected will be imported.

[.instruction]
Activating commercial transactions:

. Go to **Settings » Orders » Payment » EBICS**.
. Click on the EBICS account. +
→ The **Basic settings** tab will open.
. Click on the **Commercial transactions** tab.
. Activate the desired commercial transactions in each tab.
. **Save** the settings in each tab.

[#170]
=== Activation by your bank

After you have entered your access data into plentymarkets, the system electronically registers at your bank. Secret key values are necessary for retrieval via EBICS. They are generated by the system. After these key values were created and the initial electronic registration was carried out, the values have to be printed out, signed and handed in at your bank. Only the participant saved in plentymarkets is authorised to sign this document. The bank will not activate the EBICS interface if the signature was not given by the participant saved in the system.

[.instruction]
Retrieving the INI letter file and handing it in at your bank:

. Go to **Settings » Orders » Payment » EBICS**.
. Click on the EBICS account. +
→ The **Basic settings** tab will open.
. Click on **INI letter** to retrieve the file.  +
→ The created INI letter file can be found under **Orders » Document archive**.
. Print the PDF file.
.  Sign the document.
. Hand the document in at your bank.

The electronically submitted values will be compared with the values on the printed document. Then, the EBICS interface will be activated. From this moment on, the transactions will be retrieved at the retrieval times listed below.

[#180]
=== Retrieval times of transactions

Maximum twice a day, your bank provides the day's transactions in a data format. Currently, plentymarkets retrieves this data at 6am, 1pm and 11pm. Transaction data is available in the system approximately one hour after the retrieval. In addition, the bank provides interim transaction reports in data format several times a day. These can be retrieved and include the transactions of the current day.

[#190]
=== Retrieval times of interim transaction reports

Since the times when interim transaction reports are made available differ from bank to bank, plentymarkets retrieves them from the banks, if they are available, every hour between 8am and 6pm. For EBICS postings that have unconfirmed interim transactions, the words **interim transaction** will be written in red. If the interim transaction has been confirmed, then the lettering will change from red to green. Additionally, the confirmed posting will be assigned to the corresponding order without having to book the payment again. You have to activate the statement of account in order for interim transaction reports to be confirmed. Pay attention to the information given in table 4.

[#200]
== Setting up SEPA direct debit mandate

As part of the SEPA initiative (Single Euro Payments Area), euro payments were standardized in Germany and 32 other European countries on February 1st, 2014. Bank transfers and direct debits can now only be carried out with IBAN and BIC. You can <<order-processing/payment/managing-bank-details#67, **migrate** >> your customers' bank details automatically in the plentymarkets system. There are different types of direct debits:

* **SEPA core direct debit** → Allows a biller to collect funds from a payer's account, provided that a signed mandate has been granted by the payer to the biller
* **SEPA business to business direct debit** → Enables business customers in the role of payers to make payments by direct debit

Business to business direct debits are only permitted between companies (B2B) and they require a separate mandate. You need to receive a SEPA direct debit mandate from your customers. This replaces the previous direct debit authorisation. This mandate is the new legal authorisation for using SEPA direct debit to withdraw funds from another account.

Learn how to set up the SEPA direct debit mandate in the following video tutorial:

video::182819159[vimeo]
[#210]
=== Creating a document template
