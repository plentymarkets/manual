:position: 20

In the **Orders » Shipping centre** menu, you can use the integrated interfaces to control all of the processes that are related to shipping your items. You cannot only search for and edit shipping orders but also <<order-processing/fulfilment/shipping-centre#700, **register**>> shipping orders directly with a shipping service provider or alternatively create a <<order-processing/fulfilment/shipping-centre#1400, **polling file**>> to hand over to a shipping service provider. The appropriate action depends on the shipping service provider and the software used by these providers.

On this page of the manual, you will also learn how to generate an <<order-processing/fulfilment/shipping-centre#1500, **order summary**>> of the **<<order-processing/fulfilment/preparing-the-shipment#2500, shipping service providers set up in plentymarkets>>**. Furthermore, it is also described how to <<order-processing/fulfilment/shipping-centre#1600, **register returns**>> and <<order-processing/fulfilment/shipping-centre#1900, **generate labels**>>.

Learn more about the shipping centre in the following video tutorial. The shipping service provider DHL Intraship/Versenden is used as an example.

It is possible to edit shipping packages in a pending shipping order. You can also add shipping packages to or delete them from a pending shipping order.

[TIP]
.Return labels in a shipping order
====
In the **Return** tab of a shipping order, return labels are displayed. You can also link orders of the type Return to the registered returns. A return is usually only created after the item was shipped. Therefore, the tab of any pending orders that are not yet registered is empty.

If a weight was saved for the item, this weight is carried over to the shipping order. If no weight was saved for the item, a weight of 100 g is entered automatically as standard.

[IMPORTANT]
.Transferring shipment numbers to Hermes ProfiPaketService
====
If you register shipping orders at Hermes ProfiPaketService (professional parcel service) and wish to transfer the shipment numbers, you must activate the option **Request labels**.
====

The following information gives an example of registering orders with the shipping service provider **DHL Freight**.

[.instruction]
Registering a shipping order at DHL Freight:

. Go to **Orders » Shipping centre**.
. Select the option **open** from the drop-down menu **Shipping status**.
. Select the option **DHL** from the drop-down menu **Shipping service provider**.
. Click on the magnifying glass +
→ You will see a list of open shipping orders for DHL.
. Click on the **Register** tab.
. Select the option **DHL Freight** from the drop-down menu **Shipping service provider**.
. Select the order status from the drop-down menu **Change order status**. Select the status that you want the orders to receive after they are registered.  +
→ You can combine this function using an **<<basics/automation/event-procedures#, event procedure>>** which, for example, automatically books outgoing items.
. Select the orders that you want to register with DHL Freight.
. Click on **Register** to transfer the orders.

Choosing the option **Select all** will select all of the orders on the current page.

[TIP]
.Some shipping service providers have additional options
====
Depending on which service provider was selected, additional options will be displayed on the right side in the **Register** tab. Most of the shipping service providers do not offer additional services, meaning that the right side usually remains blank. The additional options allow you to change the shipping profile for selected orders after they have been registered. They also allow you to change the shipping date so that it is predated or postdated.
====

Also note the chapter <<order-processing/fulfilment/shipping-centre#2000, **Possible errors when registering a shipping order**>> on this page of the manual.

[#800]
== Editing a registered shipping order

Once you have registered a shipping order with a shipping service provider, this shipping service provider will be displayed behind the **registered** status, e.g. **registered DHL Intraship/Versenden**.

Registered shipping orders receive a package number and usually also a transaction number from the shipping service provider. Furthermore, they include a file that contains the shipping label for printing. The shipping costs are also displayed if the shipping service provider supports this function. The tabs that are displayed depend on the shipping service provider. e.g. the tabs **Cancellation** and **Reset** for DHL Intraship/Versenden. Different or additional tabs might be available for other shipping service providers.

[WARNING]
.Cancelling a shipping order vs. resetting a shipping order
====
If you cancel a shipping order, the registration is cancelled in plentymarkets and with the shipping service provider. This means that the order will not be collected.

If you reset an order, it is available as a pending order in plentymarkets. However, it is still registered with the shipping service provider and you will be billed for it. The **Reset** function simply resets the registration. The shipping order itself is not cancelled. Therefore, we recommend that you always cancel the order.
====

[#1100]

. Open the registered shipping order.
. Expand the registered shipping order.
. Click on the **Cancellation** tab.
. Click on **Cancel shipping**.

[#1200]
=== Resetting a shipping order

The **Reset** function simply resets the registration. The shipping order itself is not cancelled with the service provider. This is why we recommend cancelling the order.

[.instruction]
Resetting a shipping order:

. Go to **Orders » Shipping centre**.
. Search the shipping order.
. Expand the shipping order.
. Click on the **Reset** tab.

[.instruction]
Printing the shipping label in the shipping order:

== Generating a polling file

In the **Orders » Shipping centre » Tab: Polling** menu, you can generate a polling file containing the selected orders. This file is generated for the software that is used by a shipping service provider. A polling file is necessary if no direct interface to the shipping service provider's software exists, i.e. if shipping orders cannot be registered in the **Register** tab. The polling file generated in plentymarkets is usually a CSV file.

[.instruction]
Generating a polling file:

. Go to **Orders » Shipping centre » Tab: Polling**.
. Select the **shipping service provider**.
. Select the **order status** that you want the orders to switch to.
. Activate all of the orders that you want to ship with the selected shipping service provider.

→ A PDF file will be generated.

[TIP]
.Export the order summary via dynamic data export
====
As an alternative to the order summary of one day in the **Orders » Shipping centre » Tab: Summary** menu, you can also carry out a <<basics/data-exchange/exporting-data#, **dynamic data export**>>. Use the data format <<basics/data-exchange/data-formats/order#, **Order**>> and use filters to search by shipping service provider and date. Use the data field **PackageNo** e.g. to export the package numbers.
====

[#1600]
== Retrieving a return label

In the **Orders » Shipping centre » Tab: Return** menu, you can register returns with a shipping service provider. After you registered a return, the return labels are available as PDF files. You can register a return via the main order or via the return.

To retrieve return labels, you register the return with a shipping service provider in the shipping centre.

[#1700]
=== Retrieving a return label via the main order

Proceed as described below to retrieve a return label in the main order. The process for assigning **returns** varies depending on whether you have already created a return for the order in the **Orders** menu. First retrieve the label and then assign it to the order of the type **return**.

[.instruction]
Retrieving a return label via the main order:

. Go to **Orders » Shipping centre » Tab: Search**.
. Select the search criteria for the order. Pay attention to the information given in the <<order-processing/fulfilment/shipping-centre#100, **Searching for a shipping order**>> chapter.
. Click on the **Return** tab.
. Activate the order.
. Select the **Return service provider**.
. Click on **Register** to register the return. +
→ Click on the PDF icon to view the label as a PDF file.

If you have already created a return order in the **Orders** menu, you can now assign this return to the label. This is done by selecting the **Return ID**.

If you have not created a return order in the **Orders** menu, do so now by opening the main order and creating a return. When creating an order of the type **return** at this point, the return order will automatically be assigned to the return label in the shipping order.

[#1800]
=== Retrieving a return label via the return

If you have already created a return order in the **Orders** menu, you can also retrieve the return label directly via this return order. You need the return ID to do so. Returns can only be found in the shipping centre by specifying the return ID.

[.instruction]
Retrieving a return label via the return:

. Go to **Orders » Shipping centre**. +
→ The **Search** tab will open.
. Enter the return ID into the **Order ID** field.
. Click on the magnifying glass.
. Click on the **Return** tab.
. Activate the return.
. Select the **Return service provider**.
. Click on **Register**.
. Expand the shipping order. +
→ In the **Return labels** tab, click on the PDF icon to view the label as a PDF file.

You can provide the labels to end customers for download in the My account area of the online store. For further information, refer to the **<<order-processing/fulfilment/preparing-the-shipment#, Preparing the shipment>>** page of the manual. Specifically, refer to the **<<order-processing/fulfilment/preparing-the-shipment#3200, DHL Retoure Online>>** chapter.

You register returns in the **Return** tab of the **Shipping centre** for orders that the customer has already received. For **<<order-processing/fulfilment/preparing-the-shipment#3100, DHL RETOURE with enclosed return label>>**, you already enclose return labels in packages before sending them to customers. These enclosed return labels are also displayed in the **Return labels** tab of the shipping order.

[#1900]
== Generating a label

In the **Orders » Shipping centre » Tab: Label** menu, you can generate address labels for your shipping orders based on the shipping service provider. These labels will be made available as download files in PDF format. A PDF file will be generated for each shipping service provider. It is possible to download all of the PDF files at once.

[.instruction]
Generating labels:

. Go to **Orders » Shipping centre » Tab: Label**.
. Click on the PDF icon behind the shipping service provider.  +
→ The labels will be available for download.
. Click on **Generate**. +
→ You will receive the PDF files for download and can then print the labels.

[#2000]
== Possible errors when registering a shipping order

In this section, we describe possible errors that may result in data not being transferred to the shipping service provider. An error message will be displayed if an order cannot be registered.

Refer to the menu **Data » API log » Tab: Shipping centre API log** when searching for errors. Entries are saved in this menu for 7 days.

[#2100]
=== Character set

Some shipping interfaces (APIs) only allow Roman character sets (ISO-8859-X) but no Unicode. Therefore, shipping addresses should not contain Unicode characters. For example, you cannot register orders with DHL Intraship/Versenden if the address was saved in Greek letters.

[#2200]
=== Additional address information

Some shipping service providers do not process **additional address information** saved with the delivery address. Therefore, shipping service providers might in some rare cases be unable to deliver packages. +
Additional address information is not transmitted to the following shipping service providers at the moment:

* DHL Freight
* DHL Supply Chain
* Swiss Post

Check if the additional address information is transmitted to your shipping service provider correctly. If the additional address information is not transmitted, adjust your online store design so that the field for entering additional address information is shown or hidden depending on the shipping service provider selected. Alternatively, you can adjust your design so that a note is displayed to customers.

[#2300]
=== Shipping profile

Error message: Code 1: The process could not be carried out correctly. Check data entered. Invalid parameter value passed: DHLFreightDataSet_ShippingInformation.

Solution: Incorrect configuration of the shipping profile or an incompatible shipping service provider was selected.

[#2400]
=== Shipping packages

It is not possible to add packages in the order's <<order-processing/orders/managing-sales-orders#changing-order-40, **Settings**>> tab. If you want to add further packages to an order or change the quantity, then open the order in the shipping centre and make the changes in the **<<order-processing/fulfilment/shipping-centre#400, Add>>** tab.
