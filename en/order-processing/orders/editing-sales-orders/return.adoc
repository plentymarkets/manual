A return is needed whenever a customer sends back an item. Among other things, a return is used for updating the stock.

== Basic settings

Go to <<order-processing/orders/settings/sales-order-types/return#, **Settings » Orders » Order types » Return**  >> and edit the basic settings for returns before creating an actual return. The reasons for return and the item status for returned items are configured there. You have to create these reasons and statuses so that they can be used when configuring a return. Go to <<order-processing/orders/settings/basic-settings#, **Settings » Orders » Basic settings**  >> and check the standard status of returns. Change this setting if necessary.

[TIP]
.Register returns with point of sale systems
====
It is possible to register returns with point of sale systems without specifying the corresponding order. However, returns that were registered with point of sale systems cannot be assigned to main orders. The stock will automatically be synchronized by a SOAP call. Ask your point of sale system provider for further information about registering returns with the point of sale system.
