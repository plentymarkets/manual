== Allowing items to be ordered in advance

Advance orders are an important tool in the marketing mix for electronic commerce. Usually, items can be ordered at a reduced, introductory price before they actually become available. This presents an unusual case for merchandise management, since items that are not yet available can not have any stock.

Advance orders are very easy to set up in plentymarkets. There is even a special order type, **advance order**, which you can use with manually created orders.

You need to save settings for the release date and the item availability before you will be able to receive advance orders from the online store. Carry out the item settings as described below.

[IMPORTANT]
.Manual order input
====
The order type, **advance order**, can be selected when manually entering orders. The current version does not support the automatic selection of this order type for orders made in the online store.
====

=== Release date

You can find the option **Release date** within the area for editing items, listed in the **Available** tab. Here, you can use the calendar to enter the date that the item will become available (this entry is also possible via dynamic import). To do so, proceed as follows.

[.instruction]
Entering the release date:

. Go to **Item » Edit item**.
. Open the item that you want to allow your customers to order in advance.
. Click on the **Available** tab.
. Enter the date when the item becomes available into the **Release date** field.
. Click on the **save icon** to save the settings.

As a next step, make sure that this date will also be displayed to your customers. To do so, proceed as follows.

[.instruction]

. Go to **CMS » Web design » Folder: Layout » Folder: ItemView**.
. Open the **ItemViewSingleItem** template.
. Insert the template variable **$ReleaseDate** (image 2).
. Click on the **save icon** to save the settings.

=== Item availability

Another requirement is correctly setting the **item availability**. To do so, proceed as follows.

__Image 3: **Stock** tab, no limitation__

[.instruction]
Setting up item availability for advance orders:

. Go to **Item » Edit item**.
. Open the item that you want to allow your customers to order in advance.
. Click on the **Stock** tab.
. Select **No limitation** for the **Limitation** option. +
→ The item can now be sold without real stock, therefore it can also be ordered in advance.

[TIP]
.Maximum order quantity
====
If you are worried that other online sellers might misuse your advance orders to completely buy out your item at a reduced price, then enter a value for the option **Maximum order quantity** within the **Available** tab (image 1). If you enter the value **1** there, then the item could only be purchased once per order. If you set the maximum order quantity to **0**, then the item will be sold without limitation.
====

== Setting up a payment request for advance orders

The **shipping date** option usually remains unused for normal orders. However, it can be helpful to use this option for advance orders. If an item will be released in the future, then the release date will be saved as the order's shipping date since deliveries can only take place once the item is released. You can use the shipping date as a filter option in the order search and in the procedure manager.

Advance orders are usually generated some time before an item appears and are not paid for by the customers at the time when they are ordered. As such, it makes sense to inform customers about the upcoming shipment and request them to make a payment. Use the **procedure manager** to automate this process. A few days before shipping takes place, the procedure manager will automatically send the customers a reminder e-mail stating your bank details and providing a link to the checkout. Proceed as described below to set up the automatic payment request.

[.instruction]
Setting up a payment request via e-mail:

. Create an appropriate **link::/[e-mail template]**.
. Go to **Settings » Orders » Procedure manager**.
. Open the **New procedure** tab.
. Enter a **name** into the **Settings** tab.
. Select a time from the drop-down menu next to the option **Execute every day at**.
. Place a check mark next to the option **Active** to activate the procedure.
. Click on the **Filter** tab.
. Select the setting **[3] Waiting for payment** as the **Status**.
. Under **Shipped on**, e.g. select the option **in 4 days**.
. Click on the **Procedure** tab.
. Select the previously created e-mail template for the option **Send e-mail template**. This template will then automatically be sent to the customer with this procedure.
. Click on the **save icon** to save the procedure.
