==  Information about the order status

An order is always in one of the statuses. The order status changes automatically with certain events (e.g. order processing, incoming payment, invoice printing), however, it can also be changed manually. In general, the order status helps you search for specific orders within the **Orders** menu. It also helps you filter the orders that should be included in an automatic procedure, e.g. with the **link:https://www.plentymarkets.co.uk/orders/settings/procedure-manager[Procedure manager]**.

==  Default order status

The following status entries are available by default in your plentymarkets system.

==  How are order statuses assigned?

When saving an order, the order status is assigned automatically. If the payment method "cash in advance" was selected, then status **[3]****waiting for payment** is assigned to the order. For cash on delivery, status **[5]****cleared for shipping** is assigned. If an **link::/[incoming payment]** was booked for an order with the payment method "cash in advance", the status will change either to **[4] in preparation for shipping** or to **[5]****cleared for shipping**.

==  Using the order status efficiently

If orders should only be cleared for shipping when enough stock is available, then go to <<order-processing/orders/settings/basic-settings#, **Settings » Orders » Basic settings**  >> and set the option **Status changes to 4 instead of 5 if stock is missing** to **YES**. That way, orders remain in status **[4] in preparation for shipping** until enough stock was booked. The advantage of this is that delivery notes and invoices are only printed for orders that can really be processed.

It is especially helpful to work with order statuses in the menu **<<order-processing/orders/fulfillment#, Orders » Fulfillment.  >>** Among other things, invoices are created there. Orders are simply filtered out by their status.

**Possible procedure:** Create invoices of all orders in status **[5]****cleared for shipping** and change their status to **[6]****currently being shipped**. Following this step, shipping labels can be created for all orders in status **[6]**.

==  Special order statuses 5.1 and 7.1

The order statuses **[5.1]****external processing** and **[7.1]****order exported** were created for exchanging data with applications of third party providers.

**Status 5.1:** If invoicing and fulfillment are not carried out with plentymarkets, but rather with an external solution, then all orders have to be set to the status **[5.1]** before being exported.

**Status 7.1:** If an export is to be carried out at the end of the order processing (in status **[7]****outgoing items booked**), then status **[7.1]** should be set.

==  Changing status names and adding entries

In the **Name** column, you can enter different names for these statuses or add further statuses. These statuses will then be displayed in your plentymarkets system. If the text in the **Name** column is left empty or deleted, then the corresponding order status will not be displayed in your system.
