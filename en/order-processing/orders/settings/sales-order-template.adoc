In the menu **Settings » Orders » Order template**, you can create order templates for one or more items. You can then activate these templates, e.g. by selecting **Use order template** within an event procedure.

== Creating an order template

You have to create order templates before you will be able to use them. In other words, no default templates are already available in your system.

. Select which **payment method** you want to use for the order template.
. Select the **order status**.
. If you want the order template to include **items**, then select the corresponding item(s) in the **Add item(s)** tab.
. **Save** the settings. +
→ The new order template will be created. It will be available in the **Preview** tab.

== Using an order template

It is possible to use an order template when manually creating a new order. However, if you use a template that includes items, then do not add any items to the order before you have saved it for the first time. The template will be applied when you save the order for the first time. The items contained in the template will automatically be added to the order. You will be able to add further items to the order once you have saved the order for the first time. Select the order template from the **Use template** drop-down menu within the **Order data** section when creating a new order.

You can also use an order template in an event procedure. It can be selected as the **procedure**. The templates that you set up (see section 2) are available there.
