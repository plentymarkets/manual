__Table 1: options for multi-orders__



Use the menu **Orders » Multi-orders** to gather unpaid orders and compile them into one multi-order. It is possible to generate multi-orders for specific customers or for specific customer classes. You will be able to generate multi-invoices within the multi-orders.

== Basic settings

Go to <<order-processing/orders/multi-orders#, **Settings » Orders » Order types » Multi-order**  >> and edit the basic settings for multi-orders before you begin working with this function. Furthermore, go to <<order-processing/orders/_basic-settings#, **Settings » Orders » Basic settings**  >> and use the option **Standard status for multi-order** to specify which order status should be given to multi-orders when they are generated. The status **[13] Multi-order** is recommended. The following case examples illustrate how to work with this function.

== Case examples

The following case examples are only a few possibilities for working with multi-orders.

=== Multi-order per customer

Some customers may not want to pay every invoice individually, but would rather pay one large invoice each month or each quarter. The orders are processed as normal and the items are sent. However, the orders remain unpaid for. When you are ready to generate a multi-order for the customer, simply open the customer data record and click on the **Multi-order** icon. A multi-invoice can then be generated within the multi-order's **Receipts** tab.

=== Multi-order per customer class

Some companies may not want to receive an invoice every time one of their employees purchases something in your online store. Rather, the company may prefer one monthly invoice for all of its employees' purchases. Set up a special customer class for this situation. The invoice recipient is specified by saving a customer ID in the customer class. The multi-invoice is generated directly within the corresponding multi-order and sent to this invoice recipient.

== Generating a multi-order

It is only possible to create a multi-order for orders that have not been paid yet. Go to **Orders » Edit orders** or open a customer data record and click on the **Orders** tab. Then use the **Order status** filter to search for unpaid orders. For example, you can search for orders that are in status **[3] Waiting for payment**. There are two different ways to generate multi-orders. Both methods are explained below.

=== Generating one multi-order per customer class

Go to **Orders » Multi-orders** to generate a multi-order for a particular customer class and time period. All of the unpaid orders will be collected for the customer class and put together in a multi-order. In the customer class settings, use the **Customer ID** option to specify which customer should be owner of this customer class. In other words, which customer should receive the multi-invoice. Depending on the workflow in your own company, it may be a good idea to create special **<<crm/managing-customer-data#, customer classes>>** for multi-orders.

[.instruction]
Generating a multi-order for a customer class:

. Go to **Orders » Multi-orders**.
. Open the **Generate multi-orders** submenu.
. Select the **Customer class** and a **Period** (optional). +
→ The time period refers to the date when the order was received.
. Click on the **gear-wheel icon** to generate a multi-order.

__Image 2: generating a multi-order__

There you will find the function directly in the header of the **Customer data** tab. Click on the **Multi-order** icon to generate a multi-order that includes all of the currently unpaid orders.

[TIP]
.Tip: Check orders
====
If you want to check whether a customer still has unpaid orders that could be included in a multi-order, then you can search for this customer's unpaid orders in the **Orders** tab.
