In this menu, you can create a single **pick list** and set a **status change** at the same time. The pick list can either be created as a **PDF** file or as a **CSV** file, for example if you want to import it into another software.

==  Generating a single pick list

In order to create a pick list, proceed as explained below.

[.instruction]
Generating a pick list:

.  Go to **Orders &gt; Fulfillment &gt; Pick list**.
.  Select the **status** of the orders that are to be included in the pick list.

==  Changing a pick list templates

The link **change PDF pick list** takes you to the menu **Settings &gt; Orders &gt; Documents &gt; Pick list**. This is where the PDF pick list's **basic settings** are configured for the pick list. The link **Change CSV pick list** takes you to the CSV pick list's **basic settings**. Carry out these settings to set up the CSV export format. The export is carried out in the **list** tab. In this tab you need to select whether the pick list is exported in CSV format or as PDF.

==  Deleting completed pick lists

You can either select up to 50 pick lists that are completed and delete them at the same time or you can delete all your completed pick lists at once. Pick lists that are not yet completed can not be deleted.

===  Selecting and deleting completed pick lists

Selecting the pick lists and deleting them afterwards gives you the opportunity to take a look at what you are going to delete. The pick lists that are completed will be sorted in descending order by date. Therefore the newest pick lists will be shown first.

[.instruction]
Selecting and deleting completed pick lists:

.  Go to **Orders » Fulfillment**.
.  Open the submenu **pick list**.
.  Click on the **Delete** tab.
.  Select up to 50 pick lists from the list.
.  Click on **Delete pick lists**.

Next you can select again up to 50 pick lists and delete them.

===  Deleting all completed pick lists at once

Deleting all completed pick lists at once is fast and easy but if you use this option you will have no opportunity to take a look at the pick lists that will be deleted.

[.instruction]
Deleting all completed pick lists at once:

.  Go to **Orders » Fulfillment**.
.  Open the submenu **pick list**.
.  Click on the **Delete** tab.
.  Click on **Delete all completed pick lists**.
.  Click on **OK** to confirm that you want to delete all completed pick lists.
