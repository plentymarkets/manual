[#order-status]
== Order status

**System » Orders » Order status**

===  Information about the order status

An order is always in one of the statuses. The order status changes automatically with certain events (e.g. order processing, incoming payment, invoice printing), however, it can also be changed manually. In general, the order status helps you search for specific orders within the **Orders** menu. It also helps you filter the orders that should be included in an automatic procedure, e.g. with the **link:https://www.plentymarkets.co.uk/orders/settings/procedure-manager[Procedure manager]**.

===  Default order status

The following status entries are available by default in your plentymarkets system.

[cols=""]

* **[1.1]** Waiting for payment &amp; activation

For individual solutions, this list can be extended with __**further sub-entries**__ (1.3, 1.4, 2.1, 2.2, ...).

[TIP]
.Pay attention to the user rights
====
Please note that the drop-down lists will only contain those **stores** and **order statuses** that the current user was given rights to.
====

=== How are order statuses assigned?

When saving an order, the order status is assigned automatically. If the payment method "cash in advance" was selected, then status **[3]****waiting for payment** is assigned to the order. For cash on delivery, status **[5]****cleared for shipping** is assigned. If an **<<order-processing/payment#, incoming payment>>** was booked for an order with the payment method "cash in advance", the status will change either to **[4] in preparation for shipping** or to **[5]****cleared for shipping**.

===  Using the order status efficiently

If orders should only be cleared for shipping when enough stock is available, then go to <<order-processing/orders/_basic-settings#, **System » Orders » Settings**>> and set the option **Status changes to 4 instead of 5 if stock is missing** to **YES**. That way, orders remain in status **[4] in preparation for shipping** until enough stock was booked. The advantage of this is that delivery notes and invoices are only printed for orders that can really be processed.

It is especially helpful to work with order statuses in the menu **<<order-processing/orders/fulfilment#, Orders » Fulfillment.>>** Among other things, invoices are created there. Orders are simply filtered out by their status.

**Possible procedure:** Create invoices of all orders in status **[5]****cleared for shipping** and change their status to **[6]****currently being shipped**. Following this step, shipping labels can be created for all orders in status **[6]**.

===  Special order statuses 5.1 and 7.1

The order statuses **[5.1]****external processing** and **[7.1]****order exported** were created for exchanging data with applications of third party providers.

**Status 5.1:** If invoicing and fulfillment are not carried out with plentymarkets, but rather with an external solution, then all orders have to be set to the status **[5.1]** before being exported.

**Status 7.1:** If an export is to be carried out at the end of the order processing (in status **[7]****outgoing items booked**), then status **[7.1]** should be set.

===  Changing status names and adding entries

In the **Name** column, you can enter different names for these statuses or add further statuses. These statuses will then be displayed in your plentymarkets system. If the text in the **Name** column is left empty or deleted, then the corresponding order status will not be displayed in your system.

[#order-search]
== Order search

Orders are retrieved from different referrers and collected in the order overview listed under **Orders » Edit orders**. Here, they are managed using a **<<order-processing/orders/managing-sales-orders#order-status, status system>>**. You can use the order search to list all of your orders or to find very specific orders. Use the filters to search for orders that fulfill specific criteria.

[#10]
=== Requirement: User rights

Some orders may not be displayed depending on how the rights were configured for the user. This relates to the **Status**, **Client (store)** and **Warehouse** options that can be restricted in the user configuration. These options are found by clicking on the **Rights** tab and then on the **Visibility** tab. If needed, go to **<<basics/working-with-plentymarkets/manage-users#, System » Settings » User>>** and check the settings for users who work with the order search.

[#20]
=== Filter options

The default setting will always display a list of all orders received during the past 2 months because in this setting the different filter options except **Date from to** are set to **ALL**. Change the filter settings to refine your search and to display e.g. orders with a specific status.

Set one or combine several filters to search for orders with specific criteria. To do so, proceed as follows and pay attention to the following example.

[.instruction]
Searching for orders:

. Go to **Orders » Edit orders**.
. Carry out the filter settings as desired.
. Check whether the default setting for the option **Date** and the given time span under **from to** meets your requirements.
. Click on **Search** to display the orders.

[NOTE]
.Resetting the search
====
Click on **Reset** to reset your filter settings to the default settings. Click on **Search** to reset the search result.
====

image::order-processing/orders/assets/EN-SearchingOrders-01.png[]

__Image 1: searching for orders, filter options and order overview__

[#30]
==== Example settings

If you carry out the settings as displayed in image 2 (see arrows) and click on **Search**, all orders that currently are in status 7 or lower and did not have their outgoing items booked yet will be displayed. The orders listed in the search result are sorted by their **Order ID** (meaning the time the order was created). This setting will yield all orders which still have to be processed.

image::order-processing/orders/assets/EN-SearchingOrders-02.png[]

__Image 2: searching for orders, example settings__

[#40]
==== Filtering by IDs and numbers

Change the filters' default settings to search for specific orders. One way to find specific orders is to use the search fields (image 3, fields on the left). Enter IDs or numbers into these fields to search for orders, customers or items in your system and to find orders that belong to them. For example, if you enter a **Customer ID**, then you will see the orders that correspond to the customer with this ID.

image::order-processing/orders/assets/EN-SearchingOrders-03.png[]

__Image 3: searching for orders, searching by an ID__

For example, if you enter the number 3 into the **Order ID** field and click on **Search**, only the order with ID 3 will be displayed in the overview. This way, you can also search for several orders. To do so, enter the **Order IDs** separated by commas (image 3). If you search for an **Order ID**, then all of the other filters for entering information will be grayed out.

Use the operators, e.g. **&gt;** or **&lt;** or use **from** and **to** to specify a range of statuses to be filtered and displayed.

[NOTE]
.Status search filter
====
If you are searching for one or several orders with the help of one of the search fields, you must not forget to set the search option **Status** correctly (image 2, middle). If you are searching for a specific invoice number, then it is recommended that you select **ALL** as the status option, since the order could have already been delivered or could have a status beyond **7**. Hence, it is important not to forget that only orders which match all selected criteria are displayed. If you can not find an order despite having entered the exact ID, you might have forgotten to select **ALL** for the search option **Status**.
====

[#50]
==== Filtering by customer data, item data and invoice numbers

If you are searching for specific customer or item data, then it is recommended that you use the search fields **Customer data** and **Item data** (image 2 or 3). You can enter search terms as well as numbers into these fields. You can use the **Customer data** field to search for customer names and zip codes. However, you can not search for telephone numbers. Search terms entered into the **Item data** field will be searched for in the fields item ID, item number and name. However, the fields containing description texts (short_description, description) will not be browsed. When searching for **Invoice numbers**, you can also search for external invoice numbers.

[NOTE]
.Only shorten search terms and numbers at the end
====
When searching for customer or item data, it is often sufficient to only enter the word stem into the field. In this context, it is important to know that search terms can be shortened to almost any extent at the end of words, but they can not be shortened at the beginning. If you are e.g. searching for items with the search term packages, you could also enter package or pack. Searching for ackages, however, would not yield any results. The same is true for all numbers (e. g. customer numbers, zip codes).
====

[#60]
==== Filtering by order type

Use the **Type** filter in order to search for the following <<order-processing/orders/settings/sales-order-types#, **order types**>>:

* **Order**
* **Credit note**
* **Multi credit note**
* **Return**
* **Warranty**
* **Offer**
* **Advance order**
* **Delivery order**
* **Repair**
* **Multi-order** (plentymarkets Enterprise only)
* **Orders, warranties, delivery orders and repairs**
* **Orders and delivery orders**

The search will only be carried out for the order type or combination that was selected. The filter is set to **ALL** by default, i.e. all types of orders will be searched for.

[#70]
==== Filtering by date

Use the **Date** filter to search for orders that went through a certain step during the time selected. Select this step under **Date**, i.e. **Incoming orders**, **Incoming payment** or **Outgoing items**. Use the **from** and **to** fields to select a starting and ending date for the search. All of the orders that went through the selected step within this time period will be displayed. By default, you will search for orders that were received within the last 2 months. For example, if you search for orders on May 15th, then the default time period will be from **March 15th** to **May 15th** and all orders received within this time period will be displayed.

If you do not want to search for orders with the default 2 month setting, then select the desired time period as described below.

image::order-processing/orders/assets/EN-SearchingOrders-04.png[]

__Image 4: searching for orders, **date filter**__

[.instruction]
Searching orders by date:

. Go to **Orders » Edit orders**.
. Select one of the filter options from the **Date** drop-down list, e.g. **Order received** (image 4, number 1).
. Use the **from** and **to** fields to select a **starting** and **ending date** for the search (image 4, number 2).
. If needed, select additional filter options as described.
. Click on **Search** to list the orders for the selected time period.

[.instruction]
Setting: Ignore

It is not helpful to select a time period in some situations. Rather, it may make more sense to filter all orders. In these cases, the date filter will automatically switch to the setting **Ignore** as soon as you have entered something into certain search fields. These are:

* Searching by the **Customer ID**
* Searching under **Outgoing items** with the options **Not booked**, **Today** or **Yesterday**
* Searching under **Payment** with the options **Unpaid only**, **Partial payment** or **Unpaid and partially paid**

Reset the setting by deleting the values that were entered or by refreshing the page.

[#80]
==== Filtering by flags

Not only statuses but also flags can be assigned to your orders. You can search for orders in the order overview by these flags. For example, you can assign a certain icon to all orders that you think could be problematic and, therefore, have to be cleared by the person in charge before being shipped. This person could search for flagged orders once a day with the filter **Flag**, enter and save a note for each of them and then reset the flag.

[#90]
==== Filtering by documents

Use the **Document** filter to search for orders for which a <<order-processing/orders/order-documents#, **document**>> of a certain type has already been created. The following two options are available:

Proceed as described below in order to search for all orders with a document of a specific type.

[.instruction]
Searching for orders with a document:

. Go to **Orders » Edit orders**.
. Select a document type from the **Document** drop-down list in the **Filter** tab, e.g. Invoice.
. Pay attention to the **Date** filter. The default setting only displays orders from the last 2 months. Adjust the filter as needed.
. Click on **Search**. +
→ All orders for which a invoice was created will be displayed in the search result.

You can also search for an order with a document that has a certain number. To do so, proceed as follows.

[.instruction]
Searching for an order with a document with a specific number:

. Go to **Orders » Edit orders**.
. Select a document type from the **Document** drop-down list in the **Filter** tab, e.g. Delivery note.
. Enter the number of the delivery note into the **Number** field.
. Pay attention to the **Date** filter. The default setting only displays orders from the last 2 months. Adjust the filter as needed.
. Click on **Search**. +
→ Only the order to which the delivery note with the number entered belongs will be displayed in the search result.

[TIP]
.Searching for a document without selecting a document type
====
Searching a document number will also work if you keep the default setting **Document** in the drop-down list and do not select a specific type. However, if the numbers of different document types are identical, all orders that include a document with this number will be displayed. This could happen e.g. if you do not use automatic numbering.
====

[#100]
==== Filtering by coupon codes

It is possible to search for orders that contain a specific <<order-processing/orders/coupons#, **coupon code**>>. This is done by entering the code into the **Coupon code** search field. Then use the drop-down list to choose between the options **All**, **Redeemed** and **Sold**. **All** is selected by default. Select **Redeemed** if you only want to search for orders containing coupon codes that were redeemed. Select **Sold** if you only want to search for orders containing coupon codes that were sold. Select **All** if you want to search for orders containing coupon codes that were redeemed and orders containing coupon codes that were sold. The search filter only works if a coupon code is entered. This is true even if you select the setting **All**. In other words, you can not use the search filter simply to find all orders that contain coupons.

[#110]
=== Setting up the order overview

The following tools help you to easily keep track of and manage the search results:

[#120]
==== Page overview

You can specify how many orders will be displayed per page in the order overview. You can select different amounts between 50 and 400.

image::order-processing/orders/assets/EN-SearchingOrders-05.png[]

__Image 5: selecting the number of orders per page__

Use the blue arrows to switch between pages. If the order overview consists of several pages, the quickest way to switch to a specific page is to enter the page number and press **Enter**.

image::order-processing/orders/assets/EN-SearchingOrders-06.png[]

__Image 6: switching to a different page__

[#130]
=== Item list in the order overview

The individual stock units of an order will be displayed in the order overview if the option **Show** was selected for the search filter **Stock unit** (default). This way, the items included in an order and their most important parameters, e.g. **name**, **size** and **price** will be immediately available to you.

image::order-processing/orders/assets/EN-SearchingOrders-07.png[]

__Image 7: searching for orders, the item list is open__

[NOTE]
.Opening and closing the item list
====
Click on the blue arrow (image 7, red arrow) to display or hide the item list.
====

If the overview contains many orders with long lists of items, then you may find it difficult to scroll through the orders and access the information that you are looking for. That's why there is an option to close the item lists for all orders at once. When doing so, make sure that you do not change the other filters for the orders that are displayed. This will ensure that you get the same search results.

[.instruction]
Globally closing item lists in the order overview:

. Go to **Orders » Edit orders**.
. In the **Filter** tab, select **Do not show** for the option **Stock unit**.
. Click on **Search**. +
→ The item lists will close for all orders displayed.

[#140]
=== Information and icons in the order overview

Different icons will be displayed in the order overview depending on the order's condition. This will be explained further below.

image::order-processing/orders/assets/EN-SearchingOrders-08.png[]

__Image 8: information in the order overview__

You can see quick information about an order by looking at its title in the overview. You can see the <<order-processing/orders/managing-sales-orders#order-status, **status**>> and logos that show the **shipping service provider** and the **<<order-processing/payment#, payment method>>**  (image 8, arrow). You may see other icons there as well depending on the configuration and the procedures that were carried out.

image::order-processing/orders/assets/EN-SearchingOrders-09.png[]

__Image 9: different icons in the order overview__

The **Book outgoing items** icon will disappear once this procedure has been carried out. It will be replaced with the **Outgoing items booked** icon (image 9, green arrow). At the same time, the status will change to 7 (image 9, blue arrow). The status background colors make it possible to immediately recognize which orders are in the same status.

The following table gives an overview of the informational icons that display the condition of each order in the overview. The icons will only be displayed if corresponding settings or entries were saved.

|**DHL Packstation** +
The icon will only be displayed if the Packstation data is correct in the order. The Packstation data may not be correct for orders that were retrieved from markets. This could be the case, for example, if the market does not validate the address. In such a case, the icon will not be displayed. Due to the incorrect data, it is not possible to deliver to a Packstation.

[#150]
=== Functions in the order overview

The following section provides you with details about the functions that can be carried out within the order overview.

[#160]
==== Placing a reorder in the order overview

You can create a **reorder** by clicking on the calculate stock icon.

image::order-processing/orders/assets/EN-SearchingOrders-11.png[]

__Image 11: creating a reorder in the order overview__

In order to create a reorder, a supplier has to be saved for the **item**.

[.instruction]
Placing a reorder in the order overview:

. Go to **Orders » Edit orders**.
. Open the desired order and click on the **Calculate stock** icon in the order overview (image 11, number 1).
. Click on the **shopping cart** icon in the **stock** area (image 11, number 2). +
→ A separate window will open for **creating a reorder**.  +
→ If you receive an error message telling you that no **supplier** is linked to this item, then please link a supplier to the item first.
. Enter your desired **quantity** for the reorder into the text field on the left (image 11, number 3).
. Select the **supplier** from the drop-down list (image 11, number 4).
. Activate the option **Register an order-based reorder** if the reorder is to be added to this order.
. **Save** the settings. +
→ The reorder will be created.

[#170]
==== Group functions

plentymarkets provides various tools to process and manage orders as efficiently as possible. The group function described below is one of them. Using this group function, you can edit one or more orders at the same time and avoid time-consuming manual input. That way, you also minimize the risk of possible input errors.

The following example underlines the possibilities you have with the group functions: A popular item from your store is temporarily unavailable. However, there are already numerous orders for it. In most cases, sellers are powerless in case of supply delays. However, they have to inform the affected customers as quickly as possible. Especially customers who have paid in advance will have little patience.

With the group function, this job can be done easily: You simply use the **item ID** or **item name** to search, and select the status filter **ALL &lt; 7** because this procedure is only relevant for orders which have not been shipped yet (=outgoing item not yet recorded). When all orders are listed, go to **Group function** and select the option **Email service** to inform all your customers. As soon as you have selected a group function here, specific settings will appear next to the menu (image 12).

image::order-processing/orders/assets/EN-SearchingOrders-12.png[]

__Image 12: searching for orders, group functions__

In our example, the customer is the recipient. You must have created an **<<crm/sending-emails#, Email template>>** in advance. It is not compulsory to set a **flag**, but this can make sense (image 12, arrow for number 2). Before you carry out the group function by clicking on **Apply** (image 12, number 3), make sure that you have selected all of the desired orders with a check mark (image 12, number 1).

[TIP]
.Status &gt;= 7
====
If the **order status &gt;= 7**, then you can not lower this status until you have reset the outgoing items that were booked. First use a group function to reset the **outgoing items** for orders that have a status of 7 or higher.
====

[#changing-order]
== Changing an order

All of your orders are displayed in an overview in the menu **Orders » Edit orders**. Click on an order to open it and edit its settings. The order information is divided into different tabs, which are explained on this page of the manual.

[#10]
=== Information and procedures in the order overview

All of your orders are displayed in the menu **Orders » Edit orders**. Here you can see the most important information about each order. You are provided with information about the customer, the order status and the payment status. You can also tell which items are included in the order, whether the outgoing items were booked and whether an invoice was generated. In other words, you can easily keep track of the most important processes without having to open the order. Point the cursor over the symbols to see tooltips with additional information.

Click on an **icon** to open further areas within the order. For example, click on **Calculate stock** (image 1, green arrow) to check the current stock of the item or to reorder stock.

Furthermore, use the order overview to make changes to the **status**, the **shipping charges**, the **item data** or the **discount** if needed. The information below gives an example of changing the status.

=== Opening and editing an order

Open an order by clicking on the order's title line (image 1, blue arrow). The order will open in its own tab. Data and information are saved in several different tabs. The tabs are described on this page of the manual. Orders that are open can be recognized by their **ID** in the tab's title.

[NOTE]
.Saving the settings or changes
====
Most of the order's tabs do not include a save icon. Settings made in these tabs are saved automatically, e.g. changing the flag or dunning level in the **Overview** tab. You can switch to a different tab or close the order and open it again without losing the changes. However, some tabs include a save icon, e.g. the **Settings** tab. Here you can switch to a different tab without losing your changes. However, you will need to save the changes before closing the order.
====

[IMPORTANT]
.Default settings for editing orders (variable user)
====
In order for variable users to be able to open orders, go to <<order-processing/orders/_basic-settings#, **System » Orders » Settings**>> and save default statuses for **returns** and **credit notes**. No status is saved here as the default setting. Variable users also need to be given the right to edit orders. Go to **System » Settings » User » Accounts** and open the particular user account. Then click on **<<order-processing/orders/managing-sales-orders#90, Tab: Right » Tab: Menu » Area: Orders>>**.

This means that processes, such as a status change or an email service, will be applied to all marked orders. You can also use the group function to delete specific orders. The group function is particularly recommended if you need to edit a large number of orders and it would be too time consuming to edit each one individually. Image 12 shows the editing window and the options that it contains.

[IMPORTANT]
.Use the data exchange as an alternative
====
The group function can only be used for the orders that are displayed in the overview. Up to a maximum of 400 orders. Use the dynamic <<basics/data-exchange#, **data exchange**>> if you want to edit a larger number of orders or if you want to edit all orders at the same time.

[IMPORTANT]
.Save the basic settings
====
The basic settings in the **<<order-processing/orders/_basic-settings#, Settings » Orders » Basic settings>>** menu have to be saved once when the system is first set up. The settings will not go into effect until they have been saved. As such, you should click on the save icon even if you have not made any changes.
====

=== Creating a credit note

If you want to create a credit note for an existing order, you first have to open this **order** in the corresponding menu.

[.instruction]
Searching for an order:

. Search for the respective order by entering an **ID** or customer data into one of the order search fields.
. Afterwards, open the order by clicking on it in the overview. +
→ The order will open in a separate tab (image 1).

By selecting the option **Credit note: create** in the **Overview** tab (image 1), a new credit note order will be created in plentymarkets. You have now created a special order, which is linked to the original order and includes all items and prices.

[.instruction]
Creating a credit note:

. Decide which order the credit note should be created for and open this order's **Overview** tab.
. Click on the **Credit note** drop-down list and then select the option **create**. +
→ The credit note will open in a separate tab.

image::order-processing/orders/assets/EN-Editing-Orders-Credit-Note-01.png[]

__Image 1: creating a credit note__

In the **Edit** tab, you can change the options for the items in the credit note or you can remove items from those listed. For example, you can change the **quantity** of an item in the credit note. You can recognize options that can be changed by their text fields, drop-down lists or text links. On the right-hand side, you will also find the icons **Stock** and **Create reorder**. The **Delete** icon removes the item from the credit note.

[TIP]
.Tip: Check the options before creating the credit note
====
If you would like to change those options that can not be edited in the credit note, such as the **warehouse**, then you will have to do so in the order before you create the credit note.
====

If a credit note has been created for an order, then there will be a note on the right-hand side of the **Overview** tab, telling you that there is a **Credit note available**.

image::order-processing/orders/assets/EN-Editing-Orders-Credit-Note-02.png[]

__Image 2: credit note available__

[TIP]
.Tip: Multiple credit notes per order
====
It is possible to create several credit notes for one order.
====

=== Reversing and correcting an credit note

Once you have created the credit note document to a credit note order, the order will be locked and can no longer be edited. The lock ensures that tax relevant information can not be changed. However, if you discover an error in your credit note after the document was created and you wish to correct it, then you need to generate a refund reversal.

==== Setting up a reversal document template

First set up a template for the refund reversal document. The fastest way to fill all required settings is to apply the settings from the default document.  +
The following steps describe how to apply the settings from a default document template.

[.instruction]
Setting up the template:

. Go to **System » Client » Select client » Locations » Select location » Documents » Refund reversal**.
. Click on the **Transfer** tab.
. Click on **Accept** to **Apply the settings from default document template**.

The information that can be printed on a reversal document are the same as the ones that you can print on an invoice.

[#165]
==== Correcting a credit note

You can correct a credit note only by generating a refund reversal document first. The reversing of a credit note allows to see the changes once a new credit note is generated, but reversing a credit note will not cancel an order. Once the refund reversal document was generated, the order settings are unlocked and can be edited. Once the settings are edited a new credit note can be generated.

[.instruction]
Correcting a credit note:

.  Go to **Orders » Edit orders**.
.  Open the order that contains the invoice that you wish to reverse.
.  Click on the **Receipts** tab.
.  Select the option **Refund reversal** from the **Create receipt** drop-down list.  +
→ A new window with optional settings will open.
. **Save** the settings.  +
→ The reversal document will be generated and the settings unlocked.
.  You can now edit the settings and correct the order.
.  Click on the **Receipts** tab.
.  Select the option **Refund reversal** from the **Create receipt** drop-down list.  +

[TIP]
.Tip: Check the status of the order
====
If outgoing items have not yet been booked in the main order, then these stock units have not been deducted from the physical stock either. As long as the main order has a status lower than 7, the number of items included in this order is reserved / blocked in the stock. In this case, it is recommended that you change the order status of the main order to **8 (canceled)** for the reversal.

[#warranty]
== Warranty

Warranties are __**quite similar to returns**__. In both cases, the items of an order in **__status 7__** will be sent back to you. In contrast to a return, your customers expect either a __**new delivery**__ or they want their __**money back**__ (credit note) with a warranty. In case of a warranty, please note that you will usually not book items back in from the ones returned but rather that you will have a second delivery with a separate order ID and overall with its own outgoing items.

The terms **warranty** and **guarantee** are often used interchangeably. Here is how they are used in plentymarkets:

* **Warranty** +
In the plentymarkets system, a warranty is defined as the **seller's** legal obligation to correct deficiencies, which were already present at the time the item was delivered to the customer at no charge for the customer. Warranty regulations are subject to national law. Please read up on regulations and time limits in your country or contact a legal advisor for such information.
* **Guarantee** +
In the plentymarkets system, a guarantee is defined as a voluntary affirmation of the **manufacturer and/or seller** how to proceed if damages or problems should occur. A guarantee is not based on legal specifications but on a contractual agreement between manufacturer/seller and customer. Therefore, regulations and time limits are not subject to legal regulations but are within the discretion of the guarantor.

When a guarantee is given, the seller can decide whether to refund the costs to the customer, repair the item or exchange it for a new one.

If you want to reimburse the item's costs, create a **credit note** in the system. For further information, refer to the **<<order-processing/orders/managing-sales-orders#credit-note, Credit note>>** page of the manual. +

In case of exchange or repair, create a **warranty**. Go to <<order-processing/orders/_basic-settings#, **System » Orders » Settings**>> to select whether the **shipping costs** should be covered in the warranty.

[TIP]
.Tip: Warranty settings
====
If you create a warranty directly within an order, the order's **shipping profile** is automatically adopted. However, the settings can be changed in the warranty's editing window. For **delivery orders**, the correct warehouse is automatically selected as well. The **payment method** for a warranty can be changed.
====

In general, you create a warranty out of a return. However, it is also possible to create it out of the original order.

[#advance-order]
== Advance order

=== Allowing items to be ordered in advance

Advance orders are an important tool in the marketing mix for electronic commerce. Usually, items can be ordered at a reduced, introductory price before they actually become available. This presents an unusual case for merchandise management, since items that are not yet available can not have any stock.

Advance orders are very easy to set up in plentymarkets. There is even a special order type, **advance order**, which you can use with manually created orders.

You need to save settings for the release date and the item availability before you will be able to receive advance orders from the online store. Carry out the item settings as described below.

[IMPORTANT]
.Manual order input
====
The order type, **advance order**, can be selected when manually entering orders. The current version does not support the automatic selection of this order type for orders made in the online store.
====

==== Release date

You can find the option **Release date** within the area for editing items, listed in the **Available** tab. Here, you can use the calendar to enter the date that the item will become available (this entry is also possible via dynamic import). To do so, proceed as follows.

image::order-processing/orders/assets/EN-Orders-Advance-orders-01.png[]

__Image 1: entering the **release date**__

[.instruction]
Entering the release date:

. Go to **Item » Edit item**.
. Open the item that you want to allow your customers to order in advance.
. Click on the **Available** tab.
. Enter the date when the item becomes available into the **Release date** field.
. *Save* the settings.

As a next step, make sure that this date will also be displayed to your customers. To do so, proceed as follows.

image::order-processing/orders/assets/EN-Orders-Advance-orders-02.png[]

__Image 2: CMS; template variables for the release date__

[.instruction]
Displaying the release date in the online store:

. Go to **CMS » Web design » Folder: Layout » Folder: ItemView**.
. Open the **ItemViewSingleItem** template.
. Insert the template variable **$ReleaseDate** (image 2).
. *Save* the settings.

==== Item availability

Another requirement is correctly setting the **item availability**. To do so, proceed as follows.

image::order-processing/orders/assets/EN-Orders-Advance-orders-03.png[]

__Image 3: **Stock** tab, no limitation__

[.instruction]
Setting up item availability for advance orders:

. Go to **Item » Edit item**.
. Open the item that you want to allow your customers to order in advance.
. Click on the **Stock** tab.
. Select **No limitation** for the **Limitation** option. +
→ The item can now be sold without real stock, therefore it can also be ordered in advance.

[TIP]
.Maximum order quantity
====
If you are worried that other online sellers might misuse your advance orders to completely buy out your item at a reduced price, then enter a value for the option **Maximum order quantity** within the **Available** tab (image 1). If you enter the value **1** there, then the item could only be purchased once per order. If you set the maximum order quantity to **0**, then the item will be sold without limitation.
====

=== Setting up a payment request for advance orders

The **shipping date** option usually remains unused for normal orders. However, it can be helpful to use this option for advance orders. If an item will be released in the future, then the release date will be saved as the order's shipping date since deliveries can only take place once the item is released. You can use the shipping date as a filter option in the order search and in the procedure manager.

Advance orders are usually generated some time before an item appears and are not paid for by the customers at the time when they are ordered. As such, it makes sense to inform customers about the upcoming shipment and request them to make a payment. Use the **procedure manager** to automate this process. A few days before shipping takes place, the procedure manager will automatically send the customers a reminder e-mail stating your bank details and providing a link to the checkout. Proceed as described below to set up the automatic payment request.

[.instruction]
Setting up a payment request via e-mail:

. Create an appropriate **<<crm/sending-emails#, e-mail template>>**.
. Go to **System » Orders » Procedures**.
. Open the **New procedure** tab.
. Enter a **name** into the **Settings** tab.
. Select a time from the drop-down list next to the option **Execute every day at**.
. Place a check mark next to the option **Active** to activate the procedure.
. Click on the **Filter** tab.
. Select the setting **[3] Waiting for payment** as the **Status**.
. Under **Shipped on**, e.g. select the option **in 4 days**.
. Click on the **Procedure** tab.
. Select the previously created e-mail template for the option **Send e-mail template**. This template will then automatically be sent to the customer with this procedure.
. Click on the **save icon** to save the procedure.

The order type **delivery order** allows you to generate delivery orders for the individual items that are included in a main order. You can then ships these items individually or in groups. For example, you could first ship the items that are in stock now and then later ship the items that need to be specially reordered. You can use a different shipping service provider for each shipment or the same one each time. +
You can create delivery orders **manually**, **automatically** or with **event procedures**.

Problems could occur with "normal" orders if different logistics service providers worked on the same order at the same time. As soon as one of them made a status change, it would be impossible for the others to retrieve the same order. Using the function described here, each logistics service provider will work on a specific delivery order.

=== Basic settings

The **delivery orders** function can be used if the items included in an order have been assigned to different warehouses. In addition, the following basic settings for warehouses have to be selected in the menu **Settings &gt; Orders &gt; Basic settings**:

__Image 1: required **warehouse settings** for delivery orders: b) and b)__

It is also possible to use the setting **depending on the stock level**.

__Image 2: required **warehouse settings** for delivery orders: b) and c)__

[WARNING]
.**Mandatory settings**
====
These **basic settings** have to be carried out in order to use the **delivery orders** function. You also have to set up logistics service providers in your system.
====

For further information, refer to the **System » Orders » <<order-processing/orders/_basic-settings#, Basic settings>>** page of the manual.

Furthermore, you can split up delivery orders according to the following criteria: **warehouse**, **shipping profile**, **warehouse and shipping profile**, or **stock and net stock**.

[NOTE]
.Split delivery orders
====
Go to **System » Orders » Order types » Delivery order** to select the preferred setting.

=== Characteristics of a delivery order

A delivery order has the following characteristics:

* It is **not** possible to **edit** a delivery order after it was created
* The **stock** is taken directly from the main order
* An item's **price** and **weight** are transferred
* It is possible to create a **delivery note**
* It is possible to create an **address label**
* It is **not** possible to generate **other PDF documents**

This results in:

=== Consequences for editing orders

* **Stock units** that are included in a delivery order may not be deleted in the main order
* The **quantity** that is saved for a stock unit in the main order may not be reduced to a quantity lower than the item quantity that is distributed in the delivery orders.
* The necessary **PDF documents** (e.g. invoice) are created in the main order

== Creating delivery orders

Create the main order first. Pay attention to the corresponding information given in section 1. **Ideally**, the accompanying delivery orders should be generated with the help of an event procedure. This allows you to determine when and how delivery orders are generated for an order and retrieved from the respective logistics service provider. **The following examples show you how to create delivery orders with the help of event procedures and how to create them manually.**

=== Creating delivery orders with an event procedure

We will start by giving you three **examples** for creating delivery orders with the help of event procedures.

Carry out the settings described below in order to create the **event procedures** that you need.

[TIP]
.Tip
====
Select the settings in example A, B **or** C. The advantage of C is that the delivery orders are generated after the invoice has been printed.
====

==== Example A: event procedure "generate delivery order when order is received"

Use the following settings if you want the corresponding delivery orders to be created as soon as a new order is received.

The disadvantage is that the status is not taken into consideration. This means that the delivery orders for orders with the status **3.0** (or **1.0** if you work with auction platforms like eBay) are generated as well. The delivery orders will adopt the status of the main order.

[.instruction]
Creating the event procedure for example A:

. Go to **Settings &gt; Orders &gt; Event procedures**.
. Click on the **green plus icon** in the lower left corner to create a **new event procedure**.
. Enter a **name** into the editing window, e.g. **Generate delivery order when receiving orders**, and then select **Order generation &gt; New order** as the **event**.
. **Save** the settings. +
→ The event procedure will be created.
. Click on the **green plus icon** to create a **filter** of the filter type **Order &gt; Order type**. Within this filter, place a check mark for **Order**.
. Click on the **green plus icon** to create a **filter** of the filter type **Order &gt; Order warehouse**. Within this filter, place a check mark for **Multiple warehouses per order**.
. Click on the **green plus icon** to add a **procedure** of the procedure type **Order &gt; Generate delivery orders**.
. Place a check mark next to the option **Active**.
. *Save* the settings.

image::order-processing/orders/assets/EN-ENG-Auftraege-Lieferauftrag04-SI.png[]

__Image 4: event procedure **generate delivery order when order is received**__

==== Example B: event procedure "generate delivery order when order changes to status 5"

Use the following settings if you want the corresponding delivery orders to be created as soon as an order changes to status 5.0.

The disadvantage is that you are not allowed to change the main order again after you have generated the delivery orders. This is because the number of items included in all delivery orders has to match the number included in the main order.

[.instruction]
Creating the event procedure for example B:

. Go to **Settings &gt; Orders &gt; Event procedures**.
. Click on the **green plus icon** in the lower left corner to create a **new event procedure**.
. Enter a **name**, e.g. **Generate delivery order when the status is changed to 5**, and select **Order change &gt; Status change** as the **event** and **[5] Cleared for shipping** as the status.
. **Save** the settings. +
→ The event procedure will be created.
. Click on the **green plus icon** to create a **filter** of the filter type **Order &gt; Order type**. Within this filter, place a check mark for **Order**.
. Click on the **green plus icon** to create a **filter** of the filter type **Order &gt; Order warehouse**. Within this filter, place a check mark for **Multiple warehouses per order**.
. Click on the **green plus icon** to add a **procedure** of the procedure type **Order &gt; Generate delivery orders**.
. Place a check mark next to the option **Active**.
. *Save* the settings.

image::order-processing/orders/assets/EN-ENG-Auftraege-Lieferauftrag05-SI.png[]

__Image 5: event procedure **generate delivery order when order changes to status 5**__

==== Example C: event procedure "generate delivery order when invoice is printed"

This third example offers you the most advantages. The delivery orders for a main order are only generated when the invoice for this main order is printed. This allows you to edit the main order until you clear it for shipping by printing the invoice. The following settings need to be carried out:

[.instruction]
Creating the event procedure for example C:

. Go to **Settings &gt; Orders &gt; Event procedures**.
. Click on the **green plus icon** in the lower left corner to create a **new event procedure**.
. Enter a **name**, e.g. **Generate delivery order when printing the invoice**, and select **Documents &gt; Invoice was generated** as the event.
. **Save** the settings. +
→ The event procedure will be created.
. Click on the **green plus icon** to create a **filter** of the filter type **Order &gt; Order type**. Within this filter, place a check mark for **Order**.
. Click on the **green plus icon** to create a **filter** of the filter type **Order &gt; Order warehouse**. Within this filter, place a check mark for **Multiple warehouses per order**.
. Click on the **green plus icon** to add a **procedure** of the procedure type **Order &gt; Generate delivery orders**.
. Place a check mark next to the option **Active**.
. *Save* the settings.

__Image 6: event procedure **generate delivery order when invoice is printed**__

In section 2.2, you will find an **example** of how delivery orders can be generated manually in an order.

=== Creating delivery orders within an order

The **Delivery** tab is located within the editing window of an order. This tab contains the options **Generate delivery orders automatically** and **Create delivery orders**.

image::order-processing/orders/assets/EN-ENG-Auftraege-Lieferauftrag07-SI.png[]

__Image 7: creating delivery orders in the **Delivery** tab__

[.instruction]
Generating delivery orders automatically

Click on the **Generate delivery orders automatically** button (see image 7, blue arrow) to create the delivery orders. They will be created according to the setting that was selected in the **Split up orders into delivery orders by** drop-down list under **Settings &gt; Orders &gt; Order types &gt; Delivery order**. All of the stock units will be split up into delivery orders.

[WARNING]
.**Generating delivery orders automatically**
====
You can only use this function if no delivery order already exists for the order.
====

[.instruction]
Generating delivery orders manually

. Enter the **quantity** that should be carried over to the delivery order into the **DelOrdQua** field (quantity for the delivery order).
. Then click on the **gear-wheel icon** (see image 7, green arrow) to create the delivery order. +
→ This way you can create delivery orders **individually**.

[WARNING]
.**Unass.Quantity**
====
The quantity that you enter under **DelOrdQua** may not be larger than the quantity displayed under **Unass.Quantity** (unassigned quantity).
====

[IMPORTANT]
.**Stock reservation**
====
When creating a delivery order, the stock reservation for the quantity included in the delivery order is transferred from the main order to the delivery order. If delivery orders are created individually and items are still available in the main order, then they will also be reserved.
====

[TIP]
.Tip: **Deleting delivery orders**
====
Delivery orders can be deleted **individually** or **with the group function in the order search**.
====

[TIP]
.Tip: **Editing order items in the main order**
====
You can add other stock units or items to the main order. You can also delete them from the main order. However, you can only delete stock units from the main order if they are not included in the delivery orders. The number of items in the main order can be increased or decreased. However, you should only delete **quantities that are not assigned to delivery orders**.
====

[WARNING]
.Avoid deleting stock units
====
It is technically possible to delete stock units that are already included in a delivery order. However, you should avoid doing so as this can cause errors to occur.
====

== Searching for delivery orders

=== Searching for delivery orders in the order overview

[.instruction]
Searching for delivery orders in the order overview:

. Open the **order overview**.
. In the **Filter** area, use the drop-down list **Type** to select the option **Delivery order**. Then click on **Search**. +
→ Only delivery orders will be displayed in the order overview. Here you will see the **number** of the corresponding delivery order and the **date** when this delivery order was created.
. Click on a **number** to open the corresponding delivery order.

[TIP]
.Tip: **Filtering delivery orders**
====
You can select specific dates and apply other settings in the filter area to refine your search and decrease the number of delivery orders that are displayed as results.
====

=== Searching for delivery orders within an order

The **Overview** tab shows whether or not delivery orders exist for a specific order.

image::order-processing/orders/assets/EN-ENG-Auftraege-Lieferauftrag08-SI.png[]

__Image 8: delivery order note in the main order__

[IMPORTANT]
.**Delivery orders in the the order tab**
====
You can also view delivery orders directly within an order. This is done in the **Orders** tab. Here you can see all of the customer's orders, i.e. also the delivery orders that you can **search** there.
====

image::order-processing/orders/assets/EN-ENG-Auftraege-Lieferauftrag09-SI.png[]

__Image 9: searching for delivery orders in the **Orders** tab__

== Keeping main orders up to date

The **status of the main order** is automatically adjusted to be the **lowest common status** of all the delivery orders that are a part of the main order.

[IMPORTANT]
.Common status
====
For example, an order is in status **5.0**. It has two delivery orders (each one in status **5.0**). One of the delivery orders is sent to a logistics service provider and thus changes to status **6.5** (in our example 6.5 would mean "**fulfillment by logistics service provider**"). The main order's status will not change yet. It will only change to **6.5** when the second delivery order's status also changes to **6.5**.
====

[TIP]
.Tip
====
In case of a malfunction in your system, you can also set up the status change with an **event procedure**.
====

[.instruction]
Creating an event procedure for **changing the main order status to match the delivery order status**:

. Go to **Settings &gt; Orders &gt; Event procedures**.
. Click on the **green plus icon** in the lower left corner to create a **new event procedure**.
. Enter a **name** e.g. **Change main order status to match delivery order status** and select **Order change &gt; Status change** as the **event** and **[6.5] Fulfillment by logistics service provider** as the status.
. **Save** the settings. +
→ The event procedure will be created.
. Click on the **green plus icon** to create a **filter** of the filter type **Order &gt; Order type**. Within this filter, place a check mark for **Delivery order**.
. Click on the **green plus icon** to add a **procedure** of the procedure type **Order &gt; Change status of the main order**. Within this procedure, select **Lowest status of all delivery orders**.
. Place a check mark next to the option **Active**.
. *Save* the settings.

image::order-processing/orders/assets/EN-ENG-Auftraege-Lieferauftrag10-SI.png[]

__Image 10: event procedure **changing the main order status to match the delivery order status; change of status to 6.5**__

In our example, **status 6.5** means **fulfillment by logistics service provider**. Additionally, you could create an event procedure for changing the **status to 7.0: outgoing items booked**, which could come into effect as soon as the logistics service provider has registered the outgoing item.

[WARNING]
.**Editing the main order of a delivery order**
====
In order for variable users to be able to open the main order, they must have the **rights** to all of the **delivery orders' warehouses**. If needed, check the settings in the user profile.
====

[WARNING]
.**Deleting a main order or delivery orders**
====
If you would like to delete a main order, then you have to delete the delivery orders first. Only afterwards should you delete the main order.
====

== Stock and outgoing items

Stock is reserved for the delivery orders and will be reduced accordingly when the outgoing items are booked. The main order is automatically given the lowest status of all its corresponding delivery orders. It also receives the information that the outgoing items were booked once this is true for all of its corresponding delivery orders.
