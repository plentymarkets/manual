Learn more about settings in plentymarkets that are relevant for your accounting. These settings include VAT rates, currencies, exchange rates, the calculation of your prices, booking keys, revenue accounts, debtor accounts and just as well your document templates. Most of the settings that are relevant for accounting purposes can be defined per accounting location. Only the setting that defines how your prices are calculated applies to your entire system. +
How to set up document templates is described on a different page of this manual.

== Basic information about price calculation in plentymarkets

The calculation of prices is based on the gross prices of your variations. In other words, the net price of a variation in an order is calculated based on the gross price. To get the sum of an order item the individual price of one variation is multiplied with purchased number of the variation. This means, that the purchased number of a variation is multiplied with the individual gross price of an order item to get the order item's gross sum. To get the net sum of an order item the previously calculated net price of a single variation is multiplied by the number of variations purchased. The number of decimal places of the single net price is defined by your accounting settings. To get the VAT amount for an order item the net sum must be substracted from the gross sum. +
Your settings define when the price will be rounded to decimal places. Calculations that are carried out after the prices are rounded will be carried out with 2 decimal places. The settings in plentymarkets can lead to the following results:

*  Rounded single variation price
*  Rounded order item sums
*  Rounded totals

== Setting up how prices are saved and rounded

The path to the menu that contains the settings plus explanations of the settings. The settings applied to an order are the settings that were active in the moment that the order was created. This means that if you change the settings the changes will not affect existing orders.

[.instruction]
Setting up how prices are saved and rounded:

. Go to **Settings » Client (store) » Select store » Locations » Select location » Accounting**.  +
The **Basic settings** tab will open.
. Carry out the settings as desired. Pay attention to the information given in table 1.
. **Save** the settings.

.Settings for saving and rounding prices
[cols="a,a"]
|====
|Setting |Explanation

|**Number of decimal places for prices**
|Select 2 or 4 decimal places  +
**2** = The prices in an order will be saved with 2 decimal places The indirect result of this setting is that the price of a single variation will be rounded. The sums and totals of an order are then calculated based on the rounded price of a single variation.  +
**4** = The prices in an order will be saved with 4 decimal places Selecting 4 decimal places has the effect that the sum of an order item will be rounded by default. The sums are saved with 4 decimal places, but further calculation will be carried out with sums that are rounded to two decimal places. If you do not want that the sums are rounded by default, you need to additionally activate the setting **Round totals only**.

|**Round totals only**
|Activate by placing a check mark if you want that only the totals of an order are rounded. The sums of order items are no longer rounded by default if the setting is active. Totals refers to the total value of an order. When you look at the settings of the document template for invoices the settings that will be affected are the ones that are listed unter the sums heading.  +
If the option is not activated and 4 decimal places are selected, then the sum of each order item will be rounded.  +
However, if 2 decimal places are selected, this setting has no influence on the rounding of prices.

=== Example calculations

The following section compares the different calculation methods and the results. +
In our example fabrics were sold. Several panels of the same fabric were bought, but with different widths. The widths are 50 cm and 30 cm. The 50 cm panel was boungt 8 times and the 30 cm panel 7 times. 30 centimetres cost 2.187 € and 50 centimetres cost 3.645 €. The prices are calculated based on the price for one metre of 7.29 €. The settings that must be carried out to get one of the results are also listed in the table.

== Carrying out VAT settings

The VAT settings are specifically for one location. You can have different settings for each location. The basic VAT relevant settings include settings that define how the system reacts if the buyer has a VAT ID or if the delivery leaves the European Union and how the VAT amount for shipping costs will be displayed. The descriptions in this section and the way the system reacts are based on the assumption that your business is located in the European Union.

=== Using the German small business owner regulation

If you are a small business owner in Germany and you do not want that VAT is applied to your invoices, then activating the setting in your location settings is all you need to do. However, even though you the VAT is not applied, you still need to save the correct VAT rates in your settings. They will not be applied.

[TIP]
.Small business owner setting only for systems with Germany as system country
====
The small business owner setting is only available if your system was set up with Germany as system country. The system country is a setting that you have no access to and that is selected based on the information that you provided when you ordered your plentymarkets system.
====

[.instruction]
Using the German small business owner regulation:

. Go to *Settings » Client (store) » Select store » Locations » Select location » Accounting*. +
→ The *Basic settings* tab will open.
. Place a check mark next to the option *Small business owners (Germany only)*.
. *Save* the settings.

[IMPORTANT]
.Displaying small business owner information on invoices
====
As a small business owner you need to place information on your invoice why there was no VAT applied. You can use the note field on your invoice template for this information. The setting for small business owners does not automatically place a note on your invoice.
====

=== Setting up how invoices are issued for deliveries within the EU

You can choose whether customers that are within the European Union and that have a VAT number will receive a net invoice or a gross invoice. In many cases the information of the delivery's recipient are of higher priority than the ones of the invoice's recipient. The delivery address must be in another country within the EU if you want the invoice to be net. For deliveries within the same member state of the EU the setting will be ignored and VAT will always be applied. However, there is one option that will allow a different result. You need to add an entry certificate to your delivery and you need to choose the entry certificate option for the delivery address within the data set of an order. If the customer does not have a VAT number, this means that it is a private purchase and that VAT will be applied anyway. The only time VAT will not be applied for private purchases is if you are a small business owner as described above.

[.instruction]
Setting up gross or net invoices for deliveries within the EU:

. Select a location under *Settings » Client (store) » Select store » Locations » Select location » Accounting*. +
→ The *Basic settings* tab will open.
. Select one option from the *VAT number* drop-down menu. Pay attention to the information given in table 2.
. *Save* the settings.

.Issuing invoices for deliveries within the EU
[cols="a,a"]
|====
|Setting
|Explanation

|**VAT number**
|Only applies to deliveries within the EU. +
** Gross invoice** = All invoices for inner European Union deliveries will be issued as gross. +
** Net invoice** = Invoices will be issued without VAT for customers who have a VAT number. +
However, if the customer's delivery address is in the same country as the accounting location, then VAT will be calculated for the order. German law permits orders to be issued as net for customers from other European countries who have a valid VAT number and provide a German delivery address, but a certain paper must be provided in this case. This paper is an entry certificate and needs to be included with the order. The delivery address in an order as well as in the customer data includes the option **Entry certificate** for this reason. If you want to apply the entry certificate only once for a specific order, then  activate the option in the order settings. If you want to use the entry certificate repetitively for this delivery address of the customer, then you need to activate the option in the customer's delivery address data. If you activate the **Entry certificate** option, then orders that are placed by customers in other European countries but shipped to a German delivery address will be treated like shipments to foreign EU countries. The settings **VAT number** and **Export shipping** in this menu then determine whether the invoice is issued as gross or net. If the **Entry certificate** is not active, then these orders will be issued as gross.

==== Examples with the settings' effect 

In the following section 6 possible setting combinations and the effects are described.

[.subhead]
What is the result if the sender, the delivery's recipient and the invoice recipient are in the same member state of the European Union and if the setting net invoice is selected?

The invoice will always be gross despite the selected setting.

[.subhead]
What is the result if the sender and the delivery's recipient are in the same member state of the European Union, but the invoice recipient is in a different member state and if the setting net invoice is selected?

The invoice will be gross despite the selected setting. However, in this case a net invoice is actually allowed if the invoice recipient has a VAT number. An additional setting must be carried out to issue a net invoice. The entry certificate must be activated in the delivery adress data of the order. The invoice will be gross as long as the entry certificate setting is not activate. The entry certificate is an individual delivery address setting.

[.subhead]
What is the result if the sender and the invoice recipient are in the same member state of the European Union, but the delivery's recipient is in a different member state and if the setting net invoice is selected?

The invoice will be net if the recipient of the delivery has a VAT number. The invoice recipient does not play a role in this scenario.

[.subhead]
What is the result if the sender is in one member state of the European Union, but the invoice recipient and the delivery's recipient are in a different member state and if the setting net invoice is selected?

The invoice will be net as soon as either the recipient of the delivery or the recipient of the invoice has a VAT number. The invoice will be gross if neither the recipient of the delivery nor the recipient of the invoice has a VAT number.

[.subhead]
What is the result if the sender is in one member state of the European Union, but the delivery's recipient is in a different member state and the invoice recipient is in a country outside of the EU and if the setting net invoice is selected?

The invoice will be net as soon as either the recipient of the delivery or the recipient of the invoice has a VAT number. The invoice will be gross if neither the recipient of the delivery nor the recipient of the invoice has a VAT number.

[.subhead]
What is the result if the sender is in one member state of the European Union, but the invoice recipient is in a different member state and the delivery's recipient is in a country outside of the EU and if the setting net invoice is selected?

In this case the delivery is an export shipment and the setting setting for export shipping will be applied. The settings for export shippings will be explained in the next section on this page.

=== Issuing an invoice for export shipments

For each accounting location you can individually define, whether the invoice for export shipments will be net or gross. The core assumption is that your business is based in the European Union. The setting will be applied if the delivery is sent to a country outside the European Union. Your customers receive an invoice without VAT if the invoice is net.

[.instruction]
Setting up gross or net invoices for export shipping:

. . Go to *Settings » Client (store) » Select store » Locations » Select location » Accounting*. +
→ The *Basic settings* tab will open.
. Select one option from the *export shipping* drop-down menu. Pay attention to the information given in table 3.
. **Save** the settings.

.Invoice settings for export shipping
[cols="a,a"]
|====
|Setting
|Explanation

|**Export shipping**
|**Net invoice** = Invoices for export shipping will be issued without VAT. +
** Gross invoice** = Invoices for export shipping will be issued with VAT. +
If a VAT rate was saved for a country of delivery that is outside the EU, then gross invoices will always be issued.

=== Setting up VAT rates

You need to differ between your accounting locations and countries of deliveries that you need to pay tax to. An accounting location is a registered business address. 2 accounting locations exist per default in plentymarkets. The default locations are Germany and United Kingdom. You need one location at the very least and you can add further locations for each of your subsidiaries. The 2 default locations include default VAT configurations with VAT rates etc. However, do not use these configurations for the productive mode of your system. Add your own configurations and delete the default ones. You need to set up at least one configuration. You can use this configuration to ship worldwide. However, you need to add further configurations for other countries if you exceed the delivery theshold for a country. Otherwise the system can not calculate the correct VAT amounts. You need to set up a location for your registered business address and then you need to set up the country that the business is in with a VAT configuration. Once you become liable for taxation in other countries because you exceeded the delivery threshold, you need to add futher countries with VAT configurations within the same location.

|Specify which tax rate is to be used for stock units to which the margin scheme applies. If no tax rate is selected, then stock units that the margin scheme applies to can not be displayed on invoices (= basic setting). +
The margin scheme setting is not visible until you save a VAT configuration. +
*__Important__*: The margin scheme setting in plentymarkets is an older customized implementation. The tax rate will be applied to the entire amount of the stock units that the margin scheme applies to. In other words the tax rate will not be applied to the difference between sales price and purchase price.

=== VAT for digital items

The buyer's VAT rate must be used for digital items. An EU regulation puts these VAT rates into effect starting January 1st, 2015. If a VAT rate is already available for a country of delivery, e.g. because the delivery threshold was exceeded, then it is not necessary to create an additional VAT rate for digital items only. The existing VAT rate will be used. If no VAT rate is set up for one or more countries of delivery, then set up your accounting procedures in plentymarkets as described below. The EU regulation applies to B2C revenues. +
This regulation applies to B2C revenues. B2B revenues without VAT are not affected.

[.instruction]
Identifying the VAT for digital items:

. Go to **Settings » Client (store) » Select store » Locations » Select location » Accounting**. +
→ The *Basic settings* tab will open.
. Click on the *VAT rates* tab.
