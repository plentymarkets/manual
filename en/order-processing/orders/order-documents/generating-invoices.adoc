== General information about invoices

In plentymarkets, you can generate invoices, for example if you want to print them or send them to your customers as an email attachment. +
Depending on the country of delivery and the location of your business, invoices are subject to different legal requirements. Familiarise yourself with these requirements and make sure that all required invoice data is displayed on your invoice.

== Setting up a document template for invoices

Before generating invoices, you have to set up a document template. This is done in the menu **System » Client » Select client » Locations » Select location » Documents**. +
For further information and instructions on setting up the document template, refer to the <<en/order-processing/orders/order-documents#, Order documents>> page of the manual.

== Generating invoices

After having set up a document template for invoices, you can generate invoices in PDF format. In this process, a filter allows you to choose the orders are considered and whether a status change should take place after the invoices have been generated.
