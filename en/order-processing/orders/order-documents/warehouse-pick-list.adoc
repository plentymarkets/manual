== General information about the warehouse pick list

In plentymarkets, you can create warehouse pick lists as PDF files. In contrast to the regular pick list, the warehouse pick list enables you to see which orders or invoices belong to particular items. This way, items can be matched to their orders during the picking process and can be packaged directly afterwards.

== Displaying item data

Use the menu **System » Orders » Documents » Warehouse pick list** to determine which item data should be displayed on your warehouse pick lists, such as **Item ID**, **Quantity**, **Storage location** or **Invoice number**. In addition, you can determine at which positions and in which order those data are displayed on the warehouse pick list.

== Uploading a PDF template

A template is needed for displaying your store's letter paper, i.e. a page containing your company information, logo and layout elements according to your corporate design. This template needs to be in PDF format. In plentymarkets, it is possible to use a document template in PDF format to create the warehouse pick list. Proceed as described below to create a PDF template.

[.instruction]
Uploading a PDF template:

. Go to **System » Orders » Documents » Warehouse pick list**.
. Click on **PDF template**.
. Open the tab **New template**.
. Click on **Select file**.
. Select a PDF file as a template.
. *Save* the settings. +
→ The PDF template appears in the **Templates** tab. In this tab, you can preview or delete the PDF template.

[TIP]
.Tip
====
If you use a PDF template including a header that you would like to position above the warehouse pick list, you might have to change the value saved as **top margin** (see table 1).

For more detailed information on document templates, refer to the **<</en/order-processing/orders/order-documents#, Documents>>** manual page.

== General information about the warehouse pick list

Use the menu **Orders » Fulfilment » Warehouse pick list** to generate a warehouse pick list and initiate automatic status changes. The warehouse pick list is generated as a PDF file. In contrast to the regular pick list, the warehouse pick list enables you to see which orders or invoices belong to particular items. This way, items can be matched to their orders during the picking process and can be packaged directly afterwards. As opposed to the regular pick list, choosing a specific warehouse is required.

== Setting up and changing a warehouse pick list

Before generating a warehouse pick list, check the settings of the document template in the settings menu of the warehouse pick list.

The link **Change warehouse pick list** in the warehouse pick list menu takes you to the settings in the menu **System » Orders » Documents » <<en/order-processing/orders/order-documents/warehouse-pick-list#, warehouse pick list>>**, in which the document settings and the PDF template for the warehouse pick list are configured.

The following is an example of a warehouse pick list indicating the **order ID** and the **invoice number**. We recommend activating the **order ID** in all cases, since information about the invoice is not always available, as becomes clear in the example.
