==  General information about the warehouse pick list

Warehouse pick lists can be created as PDF files with the help of plentymarkets. The difference between the generic pick list and the warehouse pick list is that the latter allows you to see which orders or invoices belong to the particular items. In other words, items can be matched to their orders while they are being picked and then they can be packaged directly afterwards.

==  Displaying item data

Use the **Warehouse pick list** menu to specify which item data should be included on your warehouse pick list, e.g. the **item ID**, **EAN**, **storage location**, etc and how this information should be displayed.

| Setting | Explanation

|**Top margin**
| Enter a value (in mm) for the top margin on the page. Change the value if needed. For example, change the value if you use a PDF template that contains the company information and logo at the top of the page and you want to position this "header" above the warehouse pick list (see section 3).

|**Storage location**
| If you use this field, then decide how the **storage location name** should be displayed on the warehouse pick list. For example, only the storage location name can be displayed or a combination of warehouse information can be displayed, i.e. **shelf / storage location**.

|**Free text**
| If you use this field, then select the corresponding **free text field 1-20** from the drop-down menu. +
First, go to **<<item/managing-items#70, Settings » Item » Free text fields>>** to create the free text fields. Then link the corresponding items to the free text fields and enter values for the fields. Go to link::/[**Item » Edit item » Tab: Fields**] to do so.

This template needs to be in PDF format. plentymarkets makes it possible to use a document template in PDF format for the warehouse pick list. Proceed as described below to upload a PDF template.

You have to activate the **sales order ID** and/or the **invoice number**. Select a **position** number to activate these elements. Make sure to select a position number that is not already being used.

The following is an example of a warehouse pick list that contains information about the **sales order ID** and the **invoice**. We recommend that you always activate the **sales order ID**. As you can see in the example, information about the invoice is not always available.
