|**Top margin**
|Enter a value (in mm) for the **top margin** on the page. Change the value if needed. For example, change the value if you use a PDF template that contains the company information and logo at the top of the page and you want to position this "header" above the pick list (see section 3 below).

|**Storage location**
|If you use this field, then decide how the **storage location name** should be displayed on the pick list. For example, only the storage location name can be displayed or various combinations of warehouse information can be displayed, such as the rack / shelf / storage location. The quantity is displayed next to the storage location by default. Place a check mark next to the option **Do not show the quantity next to the storage location** if you do not want to display this information on the pick list.

|**Free text**
|Select the name for the free text field. In other words, enter the name that should be displayed on the pick list and select the corresponding **free text field 1-20** from the drop-down menu. +
First, go to **Settings » Item » Free text fields** to create the free text fields. Then link the corresponding items to the free text fields and enter values for the fields. Go to **Item » Edit item » Tab: Fields** to do so. +
