|*Best before date*
|Displays information on the best before date of a variation.

|*Batch*

For further information, refer to the *<<en/items/managing-items#70, Managing items>>* page of the manual.

== Uploading a PDF template:

A template is needed for displaying your store's letter paper, i.e. a page containing your company information, logo and layout elements according to your corporate design. This template needs to be in PDF format. In plentymarkets, it is possible to use a document template in PDF format to create the pick list. Proceed as described below to create a PDF template.

[.instruction]
Uploading a PDF template:

. Go to *System » Orders » Documents » Pick list*.
. Click on *PDF template*.
. Open the *New template* tab.
. Click on *Select file* and select a PDF file as a template.
. *Save* the settings. +
→ The PDF template appears in the *Templates* tab. In this tab, you can preview or delete the PDF template.

[TIP]
====
You should place a header above the actual pick list if your template contains a header. Make sure that top margin is wide enough for your header and adjust the value if necessary (see <<table-options-pick-list>>).
====

For more detailed information on document templates, refer to the *<</en/order-processing/orders/order-documents#, Documents>>* manual page.

[[table-settings-fulfilment-pick-list]]
.Options in the *Pick list* submenu
[cols="1,3"]
|====
|Setting |Explanation

|**Order status**
|Select the status of the orders that should be included in the pick list.

|**Owner**
|In the drop-down menu, select the owner responsible for the orders for which the documents should be generated. Select **ALL** if documents for all owners should be generated.

|**Client (store)**
|**Standard** = only standard store +
**ALL** = store and clients

|**Warehouse**
|In the drop-down menu, select one warehouse or **ALL**.

|**Sorting**
|In the drop-down menu, select the method for sorting the items on the pick list. The options **Item ID**, **Item number**, **Storage location position** and **Standard category’s name from the main store (first level only)** are available.

|**Order limit**
|In the drop-down menu, select how many orders should be handled at a time. Set a value between 5 and 300. +
The maximum number of orders that can be handled at a time equals the maximum of orders that can be selected. If the number of orders that should be handled exceeds the maximum of orders that can be selected, the process has to be repeated accordingly. The lower the chosen setting, the more efficient is the system performance.

|**Display format**
|In the drop-down menu, select a data format for exporting the pick list. Select between the following options: **PDF** and **CSV**.

|**Change order status**
|Select a status that should be applied to the orders after generating the pick list. +
The status change is an important tool to make sure that the process is not carried out twice for orders that have already been handled.
|====

[NOTE]
====
The link **Change PDF pick list** takes you to the settings in the menu **System » Orders » Documents » Pick list**, in which the document settings and the PDF template for the pick list are configured. The link **Change CSV pick list** takes you to a separate menu in which you can set up the columns that are displayed on a pick list generated in CSV format.
