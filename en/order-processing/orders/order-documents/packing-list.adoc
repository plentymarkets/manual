In plentymarkets, you can generate packing lists as PDF files. +
A packing list provides you and your customers with a list of all orders and the items included in them. In addition, the order ID is displayed in the form of a barcode. This barcode can be scanned and thus allows outgoing items to be booked directly after the shipping process has been initiated.

|Setting |Explanation

|**Order status**
|From the list, select the status of the orders that should be included in the packing list.

|**Owner**
|In the drop-down menu, select the owner responsible for the orders for which the documents should be generated. Select **ALL** if documents should be generated.

|**Client (store)**
|**Standard** = only standard store +
**ALL** = store and clients

|**Warehouse**
|In the drop-down menu, select one warehouse or **ALL**.
