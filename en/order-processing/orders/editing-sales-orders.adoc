All of your orders are displayed in an overview in the menu **Orders » Edit orders**. Click on an order to open it and edit its settings. The order information is divided into different tabs, which are explained on this page of the manual.

[#10]
== Information and procedures in the order overview

All of your orders are displayed in the menu **Orders » Edit orders**. Here you can see the most important information about each order. You are provided with information about the customer, the order status and the payment status. You can also tell which items are included in the order, whether the outgoing items were booked and whether an invoice was generated. In other words, you can easily keep track of the most important processes without having to open the order. Point the cursor over the symbols to see tooltips with additional information.

Click on an **icon** to open further areas within the order. For example, click on **Calculate stock** (image 1, green arrow) to check the current stock of the item or to reorder stock.

Furthermore, use the order overview to make changes to the **status**, the **shipping charges**, the **item data** or the **discount** if needed. The information below gives an example of changing the status.

[.instruction]
Adjusting the order status in the order overview:

. Click on the **Status** button (image 1, number 1). +
→ A list of available statuses will be displayed.
. Select the desired status (image 1, number 2).
. Click on the **save icon** to save the settings (image 1, number 3). +
→ The status will be updated.

[TIP]
.Tip: Closing the tooltip without making any changes
====
You have two options for closing the tooltip without making any changes or without saving changes that were already made. Either click on **Cancel** or click with the cursor anywhere outside of the tooltip.

[#20]
== Opening and editing an order

Open an order by clicking on the order's title line (image 1, blue arrow). The order will open in its own tab. Data and information are saved in several different tabs. The tabs are described on this page of the manual. Orders that are open can be recognized by their **ID** in the tab's title.

[NOTE]
.Saving the settings or changes
====
Most of the order's tabs do not include a save icon. Settings made in these tabs are saved automatically, e.g. changing the flag or dunning level in the **Overview** tab. You can switch to a different tab or close the order and open it again without losing the changes. However, some tabs include a save icon, e.g. the **Settings** tab. Here you can switch to a different tab without losing your changes. However, you will need to save the changes before closing the order.
====

[IMPORTANT]
.Default settings for editing orders (variable user)
====
In order for variable users to be able to open orders, go to <<order-processing/orders/settings/basic-settings#, **Settings » Orders » Basic settings**  >> and save default statuses for **returns** and **credit notes**. No status is saved here as the default setting. Variable users also need to be given the right to edit orders. Go to **Settings » Basic settings » User » Accounts** and open the particular user account. Then click on **<<order-processing/orders/editing-sales-orders#90, Tab: Right » Tab: Menu » Area: Orders >>**.

If you want to create a <<order-processing/orders/settings/documents#20, **document template** >> quickly, then simply copy a previously configured document template and make changes to the template as needed.
====

image::order-processing/orders/assets/EN-Orders-Editing-Orders-Changing-Order-05.png[]

__Image 5: **documents** that were already created in an order's **Receipts** tab__

The receipts are configured before they are created. You can specify different parameters for each receipt.

[#120]
== Tab: Reorder

Select the order items for a reorder in the **Reorder** tab (image 7). Choose whether you want to generate a reorder for the specific order only or whether you want to generate a reorder to which items can be added from other orders as well. +

====
In the **Quantity** column you can see the delivered quantity (green numbers), the pending quantity (red numbers) and the ordered quantity (white numbers). +
Partial quantities are displayed under **delivered** if they were booked as a partial delivery in the reorder under **Status**. +
In image 8, for example, you can see that **0** items were delivered. **100** items are still pending. **100** items were ordered in total.

[#150]

[#160]
== Tab: Delivery

<<order-processing/orders/settings/sales-order-types/delivery-orders#, **Delivery orders**  >> are created in the **Delivery** tab. There you can see the order's stock units, which were not yet carried over into delivery orders.

image::order-processing/orders/assets/EN-Orders-Editing-Orders-Changing-Order-11.png[]

[.instruction]
Manually creating delivery orders:

====
Click on **Generate delivery orders automatically** (image 11, blue arrow) to create the delivery orders. They will be created according to the setting that was selected under <<order-processing/orders/settings/sales-order-types/delivery-orders#, **Settings » Orders » Order types » Delivery order**  >> in the **Split up orders into delivery orders by** drop-down menu. All of the stock units will be split up into delivery orders. You can only use this function if no delivery order already exists for the order.
====

When creating a delivery order, the stock reservation for the quantity included in the delivery order is transferred from the main order to the delivery order. If delivery orders are created individually and items are still available in the main order, then the items will also be reserved.

[TIP]
.Tip: Editing order items in the main order
====
Stock units can be added to the main order or deleted from the main order. However, you can only delete stock units from the main order if they are not included in the delivery orders. The number of items in the main order can be increased or decreased. However, you should only delete quantities that are not assigned. It is technically possible to delete stock units that are already included in a delivery order. However, you should avoid doing so.
====

[#170]
== Group functions

You can use the **group function** to carry out processes for several orders at the same time. This means that processes, such as a status change or an email service, will be applied to all marked orders. You can also use the group function to delete specific orders. The group function is particularly recommended if you need to edit a large number of orders and it would be too time consuming to edit each one individually. Image 12 shows the editing window and the options that it contains.

[IMPORTANT]
.Use the data exchange as an alternative
====
The group function can only be used for the orders that are displayed in the overview. Up to a maximum of 400 orders. Use the dynamic <<basics/data-exchange#, **data exchange**  >> if you want to edit a larger number of orders or if you want to edit all orders at the same time.
====

image::order-processing/orders/assets/EN-Orders-Editing-Orders-Changing-Order-12.png[]
