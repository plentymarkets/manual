In the **Documents** menu under **System » Client » Open client » Locations** you manage and configure order documents. Order documents in this context are e.g. **invoices**, **delivery notes** and **order confirmations**.

==  Managing localized documents

There are several documents that can be configured differently for every location. These documents can be found in the **Documents** folder of each location. On the <<order-processing/orders/order-documents#, **Documents**>> page of the manual you will learn how to apply default settings or how to apply settings from other templates as well as how to edit these settings. You will also learn how to create a business letterhead in PDF format, how to use this PDF as a PDF template and how to link it to the documents. You will also learn how to create and manage numbering systems. Finally, this page includes tax information that is relevant to documents.

==  User rights

You can manage the access to documents with user rights. These rights are defined in the <<basics/working-with-plentymarkets/manage-users#90, **user's rights**>> tab. You need to open the subtab **Menu** to give a user the right for the documents menu.

==  Additional documents

Documents that do not need to be customized for a location such as e.g. address labels and pick lists are configured in the <<order-processing/orders/order-documents#, **System » Orders » Documents »**>> menu.

==  Invoice information
The invoice includes important information about the items included in an order, the recipient's address and the amount due. plentymarkets includes pre-configured templates, which you can edit as desired. The document **Invoice** can be configured separately for each language. This document is edited in the menu **System » Client » Open client » Locations » Open location » Documents » Invoice**.

The template settings range from mandatory elements to optional elements such as a payment due date or payment discount options. Some of the information that appears on templates is saved directly in the template settings. Other information is automatically inserted into the template, e.g. customer data.

[IMPORTANT]
.Displaying the bank details for debit
====
If you use the payment method **debit**, then information about the debit procedure and the customer's bank data (IBAN and BIC) are automatically written on the document. The IBAN is not completely displayed for security reasons. Only the first 12 characters and the last 3 characters are displayed. The remaining characters are replaced with "xxx". +
If no bank information is saved for the customer, then the **IBAN** and **BIC** will not be displayed on the invoice. +
The text about the debit procedure can not be changed.

==  Entry certificate information

Sellers who ship items from Germany to other EU countries are required by German law to provide the tax authorities with proof that the items actually traveled from Germany to another EU member state. German authorities introduced the so-called entry certificate (Gelangensbestätigung) for this reason. Foreign buyers are required to confirm that they received the items.

The document **Entry certificate (Gelangensbestätigung)** can be configured separately for each language. This document is edited in the menu **System » Client » Open client » Locations » Open location » Documents » Entry certificate (Gelangensbestätigung**.



VAT is omitted when a German seller ships items to a customer who is in a different European country and has a valid VAT number. The order is issued as net. However, if the customer's delivery address is also in Germany, then VAT will be calculated for the order. German law permits orders to be issued as net for customers from other European countries who have a valid VAT number and provide a German delivery address. In this case, an entry certificate needs to be included with the order. The **<<omni-channel/online-store/standard/documents/entry-certificate#10, Delivery addresses>>** menu includes the option **Entry certificate** for this reason. If a check mark is placed next to the **Entry certificate** option, then orders that are placed by customers in other European countries but shipped to a German delivery address will be treated like shipments to foreign EU countries. The settings **VAT number** and **Export shipping** in the <<order-processing/orders/_accounting#, **Accounting**>> menu then determine whether the invoice is issued as gross or net. If no check mark is placed next to the **Entry certificate** option, then these orders will be issued as gross.

The template settings range from mandatory elements to optional elements such as a payment due date or payment discount options. Some of the information that appears on templates is saved directly in the template settings. Other information is automatically inserted into the template, e.g. customer data. Refer to the link:http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/ustdv_1980/__17a.html[**German Value Added Tax Ordinance**^] for information about which specific details need to be included on the entry certificate. Alternatively, get in contact with your tax consultant.

==  Configuring an entry certificate

This chapter teaches you how to set up the template, how to apply settings from one template to another, how to save a PDF template and how to set up a numbering system.

===  Applying default settings
