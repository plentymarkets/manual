:description: In this area, you will find all relevant information about shipping service providers, fulfilment service providers, shipping processes and shipping profiles.

:nav-alias: Overview

In this area, you will find every <<order-processing/fulfilment#100, *shipping service provider*>> and <<order-processing/fulfilment#200, *fulfilment service provider*>> that has an interface to plentymarkets. The settings that you have to carry out, such as setting up a shipping profile including the table of shipping charges, is identical for all service providers. This is the reason why you will first find general settings that apply to all service providers on the <<order-processing/fulfilment/preparing-the-shipment#, *Preparing the shipment*>> page. <<order-processing/fulfilment/preparing-the-shipment#2500, *Service provider-specific settings*>> can be found in the lower part of the page.

Your plentymarkets system efficiently controls the entire process with the <<basics/automation/plentymarkets-client#, *plentymarkets Client*>>. It carries out everything from linking items with shipping profiles to registering shipments and printing shipping labels. The initial time that it takes to configure the settings will pay off when you have an efficient shipping process that automatically carries out routine tasks.

Furthermore, this area describes how you generate documents for shipping such as the shipping label and address label. All other documents that are available in plentymarkets, such as invoice and delivery note, can be found in the <<order-processing/orders#, *Orders*>> area.

It is also always worth taking a look in the plentymarkets forum in the category link:https://forum.plentymarkets.com/t/star-neu-der-prozess-basar/1093[*Prozess-Basar*, window="_blank"] (process basar). Please note that the plentymarkets forum is currently only available in German. There, dedicated sellers share their processes with other sellers.

Simply select a service provider and start setting up the interface.
