[IMPORTANT]
.Two OTTO interfaces
====
The market OTTO offers two interfaces: *Cooperation* and *Integration*. Both interfaces are supported by plentymarkets. +
There is a difference in the order import for the two interfaces. When using the Cooperation interface, OTTO transfers individual orders to your plentymarkets system which you can process and ship directly to your end customer. +
With the Integration interface, your plentymarkets system exchanges one multi-order per day with OTTO. In this case, OTTO ships the ordered items to the end customer.
