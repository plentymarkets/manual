Connecting to this market allows for the following automatic processes to take place:

* hourly order import
* Automatically create a new customer data record during the order import. This is assuming no customer data record was already saved in the database

[TIP]
.The currency may differ for import and export
====
The store's standard currency is transferred to Fruugo when exporting the item's information. However, when orders are imported, the amount will be in whichever currency the customer paid with.
====

[IMPORTANT]
.No interface for stock and price synchronisation
====
Fruugo does currently not provide an interface for automatic stock and price synchronisation. Instead, Fruugo exports data from plentymarkets via the data export URL which has to be transferred to Fruugo after registration and setup. Fruugo decides how often the data export takes place depending on the data Fruugo receives from your sales on the market.

Only items with stock will be exported to Fruugo.
