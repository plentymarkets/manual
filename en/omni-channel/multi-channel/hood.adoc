== Setting up items for the Hood store

Hood allows you to upload items and retrieve orders without an active store. You are required to have a store for some options, e.g. uploading item variations. You can link:https://www.hood.de/hood-shop-einrichten.htm[book^] a silver, gold or platinum store at Hood.

[#1000]
=== Uploading item variations

[IMPORTANT]
.Hood does not allow HTML tags in the short description of "shop item" listings

HTML tags are not taken into consideration when transmitting the short description for Hood listings of the type *shop item*. This is because Hood does not support such HTML tags. The item's *Preview text* is transferred from plentymarkets to Hood as the short description. This text is contained in the *Item » Edit item* menu within the *Texts* tab. Existing HTML tags are deleted and only plain text is transferred.  +
HTML tags are permitted in the actual listing description.
====

[#1100]
=== Displaying the stock status

The status *Hidden* is assigned to Hood listings of the type *shop item* that do not have any stock. These listings are not ended.
This applies to Hood listings of the type *shop item* with the stock dependence *limited (without reservation)* and *limited (with reservation)*. These listings are not ended in plentymarkets either. Instead, they are displayed with the status *Hidden*. As soon as the item is back in stock in plentymarkets, the listing is reactivated on Hood during an automatic stock update.

[#1160]
===  Linking your own properties

|*Adjust quantity to the net stock when listing*
|Select *deactivated* or *activated*.  +
*activated* = If the setting *limited (with reservation)* or *limited (without reservation)* is saved in the listing for the option *Stock dependence*, then the quantity will be adjusted to the net stock.  +
*deactivated* = The listing is only listed if there is sufficient stock available. In this case, sufficient means that stock is larger than the <<Carrying out the basic settings, maximum quantity for sale>> selected in the listing.

|Setting |Explanation

|*Default order status*
|Select *Status 1* (incomplete data) or *Status 3* (waiting for payment). +
*Status 1* = The customer will be guided through the order process and has to actively complete all steps. This takes place within the online store and therefore, the customer is encouraged to buy additional items. +
*Status 3* = The customer receives a summary of the order and does not have to be active. However, the customer can change some data, e.g. his or her address.  +
 You can also change the order status in the listing settings. This listing setting takes priority over the setting that is chosen here.

 *Copy item name from the market* = The item name is transferred from the market. +
*Copy item name from the store* = The item name saved in plentymarkets is transferred.

|*Down-selling in the checkout process*
|Select *Enable* or *Disable*. +
Down-selling means that the customer can reduce the quantity purchased on Hood during the checkout. Up-selling is generally possible for fixed-price items. This is why it cannot be selected here.

[#1600]
=== Setting up the listing scheduler

With plentymarkets, you can automatically place listings on the market at a certain time and you can automatically restart finished listings. Use the *listing scheduler* to set up these automatic procedures. Listings can be linked to several listing schedulers.

If you want plentymarkets to automatically start listings at a certain time, you have to define time intervals in the listing scheduler. Either select *days of the week* or up to three *days of the month* in the listing scheduler. In both cases, you also have to choose *starting times* for the listing.

[.instruction]
Setting up the listing scheduler:

. Go to *System » Listings » Scheduler*.
. Click on *Create new listing scheduler*.
. Carry out the settings. Pay attention to the information given in <<settings-scheduler>>.
. *Save* the settings.

[[settings-scheduler]]
.Settings for the *listing scheduler*
[cols="1,3"]
|====
|Setting |Explanation

|*Name*
|Enter a name for the listing scheduler.

|*Lister*
|Select *Active* or *Inactive (do not list any listings)*.

|*Runtime*
|Select *use listing runtime* or select one of the given runtime options in days. If a runtime in days is selected for the listing scheduler, the system will always use this runtime for the listing even if a different runtime has been entered for the listing itself.

|*Start times*
|Define one or several daily starting times. For technical reasons, if you select several starting times, then they all have to be *at least 60 minutes apart from each other*.

|*Distribution*
|Select a time limit in *minutes*. The listings linked to this listing scheduler will be started in equal time intervals throughout the selected period of time. If the value 120 minutes was selected for the distribution of 10 listings, then one listing would be started every 12 minutes.

|*Day*
|Select up to 3 days of the month that the listing should be started on.

|*Weekday*
|Activate the days of the week that the listing should be started on.
|====

[#1700]
===  Managing layout templates

Use layout templates to give listings a certain layout. The advantage of such a template is that you use plain text only in the actual item description without any design elements. This reduces the need for maintenance of the item description. Furthermore, basic and general information such as the legal disclosure and shipping information can be saved in the layout template. When adjusting the layout template, these adjustments will be applied to all listings linked to this template. In plentymarkets, you can create and adjust as many layout templates as you like.

Learn more about creating layout templates in the following video tutorial:

video::155941561[vimeo]

Layout templates for listings use the same structure as the <<en/omni-channel/online-store/setting-up-clients/cms#_web_design_in_plentymarkets, plentymarkets web design>>. The content that you want to display for listings can be saved using template variables and functions in the *Main frame* tab in the *System » Listings » Layouts* menu. The content is structured with HTML and CSS. The different tabs are described below.

[IMPORTANT]
.Commissioning third-party providers
====
HTML and CSS skills are necessary to create a layout template. We recommend that you commission a service provider to create a layout template if you are not experienced in doing so. Go to *System » Listings » Layouts* to import a <<Managing layout templates, layout template>> that was created externally into plentymarkets.
====

[.subhead]
Main frame

In the *Main frame* tab, enter the visible content for listings that are set up with this layout template. Replace dynamic content such as the item description, item images, listing description and so on with template variables and functions. They will be replaced by the corresponding content of the listing.

[.subhead]
HTML structure

In the *HtmlStructure* tab, enter the HTML code that provides the content of the layout template with the desired structure. The template variable *$MainFrame* displays the dynamic content saved in the *Main frame* tab.

[.subhead]
CSS

In the *CSS* tab, set up the cascading style sheet that is used to display the layout template. CSS denotes a markup language for structured documents. While HTML lets you create the pure content, CSS offers you more possibilities to influence the format and structure of this content, e.g. font type and size.

|Setting |Explanation

|*Item ID*
|The ID appears automatically. It is the same ID that the item has. Click on the ID to open the item in the background.

|*Type*
|Select *Auction*, *Fixed price* or *Shop item*.  +
*Auction* = Customers can bid on the item. The customer who submits the highest bid receives the item.  +
*Fixed price* = The item is offered for a fixed price. The first customer who is willing to pay this price receives the item.  +
*shop item* = The item is offered in the Hood store. +
The *duration* and the *payment methods* of the listing are ignored for Hood listings of the type shop item. The payment methods for shop items are centrally set up in the store and not separately for each shop item.

|*Number per lot*
|Define the quantity of items offered in a single listing. The listing price applies to the entire quantity.

|*Stock dependence*
|Select the <<en/stock-management/managing-stocks, stock>> of the listing. Select one of the following options: +
*unlimited (with synchronisation)* = The maximum amount that can be purchased is transferred to the platform. The current stock is not taken into consideration for this setting. Once the stock has been synchronised with plentymarkets, the maximum amount that can be purchased is offered again on the platform. +
*limited (with reservation)* = The current stock from the warehouse is transferred. If the stock in the warehouse exceeds the maximum amount that can be purchased, then only the amount that is set in the listing is transferred. The amount is reserved for the current listing. This amount is not available for other markets. +
*limited (without reservation)* = The current stock from the warehouse is transferred. If the stock in the warehouse exceeds the maximum amount that can be purchased, then only the amount that is set in the listing is transferred. The amount is not reserved for the current listing. The amount is available for other markets. Overselling can occur if the item is purchased on several different markets at the same time. +
*unlimited (with synchronisation)* = The maximum amount that can be purchased is transferred to the platform. The current stock is not taken into consideration for this setting. Once a purchase is made, the quantity is not synchronised and not refilled, but it remains as it is.

|*Tie to item price*
|Tie the price of the fixed price listing to the item price. When a price changes, it is not automatically changed on the market as well. Rather, the price only changes if it is manually updated or after the stock is synchronised. The price on the market can also change after the stock is synchronised if the exchange rate changed.

|*Transfer as item number*
| Select one of the following options which is transferred as the *item number*: +
*do not transmit* = No item number is transferred. +

*transmit UPC* = The Universal Product Code is transferred. +
*transmit MPN* = The Manufacturer's Part Number is transferred. +
