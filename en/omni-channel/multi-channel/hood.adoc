== Setting up items for the Hood store

Hood allows you to upload items and retrieve orders without an active store. You are required to have a store for some options, e.g. uploading item variations. You can link:https://www.hood.de/hood-shop-einrichten.htm[**book**, window="_blank"] a silver, gold or platinum store at Hood.

[#1000]
=== Uploading item variations

You need to book a store in order to upload item variations to Hood. Once you have booked a store on Hood, the items will be integrated into Hood with category links.

This will allow you to select them in the listing.

[.instruction]

[IMPORTANT]
.Hood does not allow HTML tags in the short description of "store item" listings

HTML tags are permitted in the actual listing description.
====

[#1100]

**deactivated** = All listings will be active until they are manually ended or until they expire.

|**Adjust quantity to the net stock when listing**
|Select **activated** or **deactivated**.  +
**activated** = If the setting **limited (with reservation)** or **limited (without reservation)** is saved in the listing for the option **Stock dependence**, then the quantity will be adjusted to the net stock.  +
deactivated = The listing will only be listed if there is sufficient stock available. In this case, sufficient means that stock is larger than the <<omni-channel/multi-channel/hood#290, **maximum quantity for sale** >> selected in the listing.

.settings for the **checkout**
[cols="a,a"]
|====
|Setting |Explanation

|**Default order status**
|Select **Status 1** (incomplete data) or **Status 3** (waiting for payment). +
**Status 1** = The customer will be guided through the order process and has to actively complete all steps. This takes place within the online store and therefore, the customer is encouraged to buy additional items. +
**Status 3** = The customer receives a summary of the order and does not have to be active. However, the customer can change some data, e.g. his or her address.  +
You can also change the order status in the listing settings. This listing setting takes priority over the setting that is chosen here.

|**Default order status for orders containing unknown items (ID: -2)**
|Select **Status 2** (waiting for activation) or **Status 3** (waiting for payment). If a listing cannot be assigned to an item during the order import, it receives the ID -2.

|**Item names in order items**
|Select **Copy item name from the market** or **Copy item name from the store**. +
**Copy item name from the market** = The item name is transferred from the market. +
**Copy item name from the store** = The item name saved in plentymarkets is transferred.

|**Down-selling in the checkout process**
|Select **Enable** or **Disable**. +
Down-selling means that the customer can reduce the quantity purchased on Hood during the checkout. Up-selling is generally possible for fixed-price items. This is why it cannot be selected here.

|Select **Transfer from Hood** or **Have it calculated by plentymarkets**. +

|Select one of the following options to assign a listing to an item during the order import:  +
**Automatically** +
**No automatic assignment based on title** +
**No automatic assignment** +
**Automatic assignment based on title only** +
**Assignment based on external item ID** +
**Assignment of SKU to item number** +
The item ID **-2** will be used if a listing could not be assigned or should not be assigned.

[#1600]
=== Setting up the listing scheduler

With plentymarkets, you can automatically place listings on Hood at a certain time and you can automatically re-start finished listings. Use the **listing scheduler** to set up these automatic procedures. Listings can be linked to several listing schedulers.

If you want plentymarkets to automatically start listings at a certain time, you have to define time intervals in the listing scheduler. Either select **days of the week** or up to three **days of the month** in the listing scheduler. In both cases, you also have to choose **starting times** for the listing.

[.instruction]
Setting up the listing scheduler:

. Go to **Settings » Listings » Listing scheduler**.
. Click on **Create new listing scheduler**.
. Carry out the settings as desired. Pay attention to the information given in table 8.
. **Save** the settings.

.settings for the **listing scheduler**
[cols="a,a"]
|====
|Setting |Explanation

|**Lister**
|Select **Active** or **Inactive**.

|**Runtime**
|Select **use listing runtime** or select one of the given runtime options in days. If a runtime in days is selected for the listing scheduler, the system will always use this runtime for the listing even if a different runtime has been entered for the listing itself.

|**Start times**
|Define one or several daily starting times. For technical reasons, if you select several starting times, then they all have to be **at least 60 minutes apart from each other**.

|**Distribution**
|Select a time limit in **minutes**. The listings linked to this listing scheduler will be started in equal time intervals throughout the selected period of time. If the value 120 minutes was selected for the distribution of 10 listings, then one listing would be started every 12 minutes.

|**Day**
|Select up to 3 days of the month that the listing should be started on.

|**Weekday**
|Activate the days of the week that the listing should be started on.
|====

[#1700]
===  Managing layout templates

Use layout templates to give listings a certain layout. The advantage of such a template is that you use plain text only in the actual item description without any design elements. This reduces the need for maintenance of the item description. Furthermore, basic and general information such as the legal disclosure and shipping information can be saved in the layout template. When adjusting the layout template, these adjustments will be applied to all listings linked to this template. In plentymarkets, you can create and adjust as many layout templates as you like.

Learn more about creating layout templates in the following video tutorial:

video::155941561[vimeo]

Layout templates for listings use the same structure as the **<<omni-channel/online-store/cms#web-design, plentymarkets web design  >>**. The content that you want to display for listings can be saved using template variables and functions in the **Main frame** tab in the **Settings » Listings » Layout templates** menu. The content is structured with HTML and CSS. The different tabs are described below.

[IMPORTANT]
.Commissioning third-party providers
====
HTML and CSS skills are necessary to create a layout template. We recommend that you commission a service provider to create a layout template if you are not experienced in doing so. Use the **<<omni-channel/multi-channel/ebay#300, import function >>** to import layout templates that were created externally into plentymarkets.
====

[.subhead]
Main frame

In the **Main frame** tab, enter the visible content for listings that are set up with this layout template. Replace dynamic content such as the item description, item images, listing description and so on with template variables and functions. They will be replaced by the corresponding content of the listing.

[.subhead]
HTML structure

In the **HtmlStructure** tab, enter the HTML code that provides the content of the layout template with the desired structure. The template variable **$MainFrame** displays the dynamic content saved in the **Main frame** tab.

[.subhead]
CSS

In the **CSS** tab, set up the cascading style sheet that is used to display the layout template. CSS denotes a markup language for structured documents. While HTML lets you create the pure content, CSS offers you more possibilities to influence the format and structure of this content, e.g. font type and size.

**Store item** = The item is offered in the Hood store. +
The **<<omni-channel/multi-channel/hood#320, duration >>** and the **<<omni-channel/multi-channel/hood#50, payment methods >>** of the listing will be ignored for Hood listings of the type Store item.

|Define the quantity of items offered in a single listing. The listing price applies to the entire quantity.

|**Stock dependence**
|Select the **link::/[stock dependence]** of the listing. Select one of the following options: +
**unlimited (with synchronisation)** = The maximum amount that can be purchased will be transferred to the platform. The current stock will not be taken into consideration.

|**Tie to item price**
|Tie the price of the fixed price listing to the item price. When a price changes, it is not automatically changed on the market as well. Rather, the price only changes if it is manually updated or after the stock is synchronised. The price on the market can also change after the stock is synchronised if the exchange rate changed.

|**Transfer as item number**
| Select one of the following options which is transferred as the **item number**: +

**transmit MPN** = The Manufacturer's Part Number will be transferred. +
**transmit GTIN** = The Global Trade Item Number will be transferred. +
