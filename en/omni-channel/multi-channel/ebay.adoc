This option is useful, e.g. when all items of a listing have been sold and then the stock will increase due to new incoming items or returns, but you want to restart the listing with a certain stock.  +
The entered value for minimum stock doesn't affect GTC offers for which **Yes** was selected for the **Use out of stock control** setting.

====

[#900]
===  Linking purchase cancellation statuses

Purchase cancellation statuses are used to process purchase cancellation. Create new **<<order-processing/orders/managing-sales-orders#order-status, order statuses>>** and link them with the purchase cancellation statuses from eBay to import and edit eBay purchase cancellations in plentymarkets. When importing a purchase cancellation request, the correct status will automatically be set in the order.

[.instruction]

[#1000]
===  Synchronising stock

For all listings with the duration **endless** (GTC), automatic stock synchronisation can be activated. eBay's **End** and **Relist** functions are carried out every 15 minutes. The search ranking remains the same. As soon as a listing is relisted by means of the automatic stock update, all settings of this listing will be reloaded and the offer will be published on eBay with the new options. Stock will be updated in plentymarkets and transferred to eBay every 20 minutes. If you want to update other data, e.g. description or price, the eBay **Update** function must be carried out manually in plentymarkets.

[IMPORTANT]
.Avoiding duplicate listings
====
After booking stock, wait at least one hour before manually starting a listing with the GTC function. This will help you avoid duplicate listings. Furthermore, the **Endless lister** function must be deactivated for listings with the duration **endless (GTC)**.
====

Go to **Listings » Active listings** and set up the following filters to display all listings using the automatic stock update:

*  Duration: **endless (GTC)**
*  Relisted: **No**
*  Stock dependence: **limited (without reservation)**

All listings displayed when using these filters are affected by the automatic stock update, i.e. all endless listings with limited stock dependence without reservation that haven't been relisted, will be ended, updated or restarted via the automatic stock update depending on the current net stock.

[#1100]
====  Activating the automatic stock update

The automatic stock update is available for listings with **limited (without reservation)** or **unlimited (with synchronisation)** stock dependence only. If a listing with the **limited (without reservation)** option is started, then the quantity will be updated whenever changes of stock occur during the entire duration of the offer. The listing will be ended when sold out and restarted as soon as stock is available. The eBay ranking remains the same. Listings with the **unlimited (with synchronisation)** option will not be ended and restarted automatically. The ranking of a listing with a certain duration, e.g. 7 days, remains the same, if you search for listings that were ended early and relist them using the **End and restart listing** group function as soon as stock is available.

[.instruction]
Activating the automatic stock update:

.  Go to **System » Markets » eBay » Settings » Tab: Initial settings**.
.  Select **Yes** for the **Activate automatic stock update** setting.
. **Save** the settings.

[#1200]
====  Relisting automatically

In order to relist a listing on eBay, the listing must have been active at least once and it must not have ended more than 90 days ago. The automatic stock update detects when new stock for an item is available and activates eBay's **Relist** function. In doing so, the existing eBay ID will be transferred. A new offer will be created on eBay and linked with your old offer. A new eBay ID is created in the process. The old eBay ranking will be applied, assuming that no data, e.g. the price, has changed.

When the **Use out of stock control** option is set in the **System » Markets » eBay » Settings » Tab: Account settings** menu, the function of the automatic stock update changes. A listing will not be ended when an item is out of stock. The item is still displayed but cannot be purchased. The number of items sold will not be set to zero on eBay when the item is available again. Rather, the number remains in the sales history. Even when the **End offers automatically** setting is active in the **System » Listings » Stock** menu, listings will not be ended. They cannot be purchased instead. For further information, refer to eBay's link:http://pages.ebay.co.uk/help/sell/relist.html[**Relisting your item**^] page.

===  Managing layout templates

Use layout templates to give listings a certain layout. The advantage of such a template is that you use plain text only in the actual item description without any design elements. This reduces the need for maintenance of the item description. Furthermore, basic and general information such as the legal disclosure and shipping information can be saved in the layout template. When adjusting the layout template, these adjustments will be applied to all listings linked to this template. In plentymarkets, you can create and adjust as many layout templates as you like.

Learn more about creating layout templates in the following video tutorial:

video::155941561[vimeo]

Layout templates for listings use the same structure as the **<<omni-channel/online-store/cms#web-design, plentymarkets web design>>**. The content that you want to display for listings can be saved using template variables and functions in the **Main frame** tab in the **System » Listings » Layouts** menu. The content is structured with HTML and CSS. The different tabs are described below.

[IMPORTANT]
.Commissioning third-party providers
====
HTML and CSS skills are necessary to create a layout template. We recommend that you commission a service provider to create a layout template if you are not experienced in doing so. Use the **<<omni-channel/multi-channel/ebay#300, import function>>** to import layout templates that were created externally into plentymarkets.
====

[.subhead]
Main frame

In the **Main frame** tab, enter the visible content for listings that are set up with this layout template. Replace dynamic content such as the item description, item images, listing description and so on with template variables and functions. They will be replaced by the corresponding content of the listing.

[.subhead]
HTML structure

In the **HtmlStructure** tab, enter the HTML code that provides the content of the layout template with the desired structure. The template variable **$MainFrame** displays the dynamic content saved in the **Main frame** tab.

[.subhead]
CSS

In the **CSS** tab, set up the cascading style sheet that is used to display the layout template. CSS denotes a markup language for structured documents. While HTML lets you create the pure content, CSS offers you more possibilities to influence the format and structure of this content, e.g. font type and size.

[.instruction]
Importing layout templates:

.  Click on **Open**.  +
→ The layout template is imported and displayed in the overview.

[#3100]
====  Linking a layout template

Now link the listings to the layout template. Use one **<<omni-channel/multi-channel/ebay#550, listing template>>** for several listings. Individual listings are linked directly within the listing.

[.instruction]
Linking listings to layout templates:

.  Go to **Listings » Edit listings**.
.  Open a listing and click on the **Description and layout** tab.
.  Use the drop-down menu to select which **layout template** you want to link to the listing.

====  Template variables and template functions

Fill the HTML layout with the desired and necessary template variables and functions and this way, have the corresponding content of the listing placed in the layout. Pay attention to upper and lower case letters in the template variables and functions.

Fill in the item description **{% GetItemDescription() %}** instead of the description that is saved with the listing. This way, you will only need to maintain one description text for your online store and listings.

The following table explains the template variable and functions in the **Layout templates** menu in alphabetical order:

[NOTE]
.Use if-logic
====
You can use the <<omni-channel/online-store/cms-syntax#basics-if, **if/else logic**>> for layout templates. They function the same way that the logic works in the **<<omni-channel/online-store/cms#web-design, plentymarkets web design>>** area.
====

[#3150]
==== eBay item import

Items can also be created by simply importing data from eBay. Go to **<<basics/data-exchange/importing-data#210, Data » eBay listings>>** and carry out the data import. The whole description of the eBay listing will be saved as the item or listing description in plentymarkets. All layout elements (HTML tags etc.) of the listing will be imported. Therefore, you need to manually edit the listing after the import. If you still wish to immediately start your listings on eBay via plentymarkets, simply create a layout template containing only the template function **{% GetItemDescription() %}** and nothing else. This way, the existing description will be used as the listing description without any additional specifications.

[#3200]

| Setting | Explanation

|**Item ID**
| The ID appears automatically. It is the same ID that the item has. Click on the ID to open the item in the background.

|**Type**
| Select the listing type. For eBay, the listing types **Auction** and **Fixed price** are available.

|**Number per lot**
| Define the quantity of items offered in a single listing. The listing price applies to the entire quantity.

|**Stock dependence**
| Select the **<<stock-management/managing-stocks#. stock dependence>>** of the listing. Select one of the following options:  +
**unlimited (with synchronisation)** = The maximum amount that can be purchased will be transferred to the platform. The current stock will not be taken into consideration. Once the stock has been synchronised with plentymarkets, the maximum amount that can be purchased will be offered again on the platform.  +
**limited (with reservation)** = The current stock from the warehouse will be transferred. If the stock in the warehouse exceeds the maximum amount that can be purchased, then only the amount that is set in the listing will be transferred. The amount will be reserved for the current listing. This amount will not be available for other markets.  +
**limited (without reservation)** = The current stock from the warehouse will be transferred. If the stock in the warehouse exceeds the maximum amount that can be purchased, then only the amount that is set in the listing will be transferred. The amount will not be reserved for the current listing. The amount will be available for other markets. Overselling can occur if the item is purchased on several different markets at the same time.  +
**unlimited (without synchronisation)** = The maximum amount that can be purchased will be transferred to the platform. The current stock will not be taken into consideration. Once a purchase is made, the quantity will not be synchronised and will not be refilled. Rather, it will remain as it is.

|**Tie to item price**
| Tie the price of a listing to the item price.  +
Listing type **Fixed price**: When the price changes, it is not automatically changed on the market as well. You have to update the price manually or carry out a stock synchronisation. The price on the market can also change after the stock is synchronised if the exchange rate changed.  +
Listing type **Auction**: The item price will be used as the price for the **Buy it now** option.

|**Transfer as item number**
| Select one of the following options which is transferred as the **item number**:  +
**do not transmit** = No item number will be transferred.  +
**transmit EAN** = The International Article Number (EAN) will be transferred.  +
**transmit ISBN** = The ISBN will be transferred.  +
**transmit ePID** = The eBay Product ID will be transferred.  +
**transmit UPC** = The Universal Product Code will be transferred. In order to use this option, an EAN has to be selected for the setting **UPC from EAN field**.  +
**transmit MPN** = The Manufacturer's Part Number will be transferred.  +
**transmit GTIN** = The Global Trade Item Number will be transferred.  +
**custom-made or no-name product** = Select this option if the item is not uniquely identified or if it is not a brand-name item.

|**Price linkage**
| Select a price ID to use a **price set** for the listing.

|**Markets**
| Select one or multiple markets. **eBay**, **Hood** and **ricardo** are available. Select the eBay platform in addition to eBay.

===  Editing multiple listings

Edit multiple listings with the **Group function** or the **Batch processing** function in the **Listings** menu. The group function edits previously selected listings. The batch processing function edits previously filtered listings.

[TIP]
.Which method should you use?

====
In particular, be sure to check the settings for eBay properties. It is very important that you check the settings, since the listing cannot be started or updated if the settings are incorrect.

Click on the **eBay properties** link in the listing's basic settings. Check to make sure that the attribute names, which were used for the item variations, e.g.: size or colour, do not have values entered for them. If there are values entered in these text fields, simply delete them.

[#7200]
===  Manually sending dunning letters

If you want to send your dunning letters manually, carry out the required settings directly in the eBay order. You can start dunning procedures in agreement with the purchaser when:

* the purchaser no longer wants the item
* the purchaser made a bad buy
* the purchaser has returned the item and wants a refund
* purchaser and seller could not agree on the terms and conditions
* there is another unspecified reason

You can also start an eBay dispute process in plentymarkets when:

* there is another unspecified reason

[.instruction]
Manually sending a dunning letter:

→ The editing mode for the stock units will be activated.
.  Select a dunning procedure from the **eBay Start dunning procedure...** drop-down menu.  +
→ The **eBay Start dunning procedure** window will open.
.  Click on **OK** to start the dunning procedure.

[#7300]
===  Automatically sending dunning letters

You need to set up an automatic procedure in the <<basics/automation/procedure-manager#, **procedure manager**>> in order to automatically send dunning information. You can enter the conditions under which the procedures are carried out and define a time for them.

The eBay dispute process can be started with plentymarkets. The customer receives a request for payment via eBay. The dispute process is intended for orders for which payment is outstanding for more than 4 days. In plentymarkets, these orders are referred to as **outstanding orders**. These orders are displayed in the <<omni-channel/multi-channel/ebay#1010, **System » Markets » eBay » Data exchange**>> menu and can be retrieved there.

[.instruction]
Automatically sending a dunning letter:

.  Go to **System » Orders » Procedures**.
.  Click on the **New procedure** tab.
.  Carry out the settings as desired. Pay attention to the information given in table 29.
. **Save** the settings.

==  Processing returns

Different ways of processing incoming return requests from eBay customers are available in plentymarkets.

*  Accept a return request and reclaim the items.

*  Offer your customer partial refund of the purchase price.
*  Reject a return request if your eBay terms of return allow it.

video::149415322[vimeo]

[#7500]
===  Importing returns

eBay returns and return statuses of the last 14 days are automatically imported from eBay to plentymarkets and updated every hour. When importing, new returns are created with the **Standard status for return** in the **Orders » Edit orders** menu. The reason for return chosen by the customer on eBay is assigned to a <<order-processing/orders/managing-sales-orders#return, **reason for return**>> in plentymarkets. Imported eBay returns are edited the same way as other **<<order-processing/orders/managing-sales-orders#return, returns>>** in plentymarkets.

[#7600]
===  Editing returns

The return process depends on whether the customer paid with PayPal or another payment method. If PayPal was used to pay for the item, then initiate a (partial) refund which eBay will carry out for you. The refund amount will automatically be booked from your PayPal account to the customer's PayPal account. Due to the eBay Money Back Guarantee, eBay sets a return directly to the status **Ended** as soon as you have accepted the return if the item was paid for with PayPal. With other payment methods, you initiate refunds yourself and inform eBay about accepting the refund. The customer has to confirm the receipt of the refund. In both cases, you use event procedures to automatically inform eBay about the progress of the return process.

[#7700]
===  Automating returns

Set up <<basics/automation/event-procedures#, **event procedures**>> to automatically exchange information with eBay. With event procedures, you initiate refunds from PayPal payments, mark returns as received and inform eBay that you have paid the refund. Event procedures will be triggered when you change the status of a return in the menu **<<order-processing/orders/managing-sales-orders#return, Orders » Edit orders » Open return>>**.

[IMPORTANT]
.Editing returns in the order type "return" or "credit note"
====
Before you set up event procedures for refunds, decide whether refunds should be edited in the order type **Return** or whether credit notes should be created. If you create credit notes, then select the filter **Order type &gt; Credit notes** for event procedures with refunds. Since edited eBay statuses are imported into both the credit note and into the return, the event procedure would otherwise be triggered twice, i.e. for the return and for the credit note.

===  Examples of return processes

The following section illustrates the return process. It describes returns when items are sent back, when items are not sent back and also returns with a partial refund. You have to create **order statuses for eBay returns** and link them with the eBay return statuses in order for the described processes to work. Additionally, you have to set up the event procedures described above.

[TIP]
.eBay returns can also be processed on eBay
====
Instead of partially automating the processes with plentymarkets as described here, you can choose to process eBay returns directly in your eBay account. The return status is automatically updated every hour in plentymarkets.
====

[#8600]
====  Full refund with return of the item

This section describes a possible scenario where the customer returns the item to the seller and receives a full refund. The following information gives an example of a return with an own label. If you work with eBay return labels, select the status **eBay: Accept return, with eBay label** and the event procedure **Accept return**.

.  The purchaser requests a return in his or her My eBay account.
.  The return request is imported into plentymarkets and saved with the standard status for returns.
.  The seller checks the reason for return under **Orders » Edit orders » Open return » Tab: Stock units » Note**.
.  The seller accepts the return and sets the return to the status **eBay: Accept return** +
→ The event procedure **Accept return** is triggered and your decision is transferred to eBay.
.  The seller generates the return label in the menu **Orders » Shipping-Center**.
.  The seller sets the return to the status **eBay: Upload own label**. +
→ The event procedure **Upload own label on eBay** is triggered.
.  The purchaser sends the item back and marks it as sent in his or her My eBay account.  +
→ The return changes to the status **eBay: purchaser sent return**.
.  The seller receives the item.
.  The seller checks the item and sets the status in the **Orders » Edit orders » Open return** menu to **eBay: Mark return as received**.  +
→ The event procedure **Mark eBay return as received** is triggered and the new status is transferred to eBay.
.  The rest of the refund process depends on which payment method was used by the purchaser:
.  PayPal payment:
*  The seller sets the return status to **Initiate eBay refund (PayPal)**.  +
→ The event procedure **Issue eBay refund to customer** is triggered and the new status is transferred to eBay.  +
→ The refund amount is directly booked from the seller's PayPal account to the purchaser's PayPal account.  +
→ The return changes to the status **eBay: return closed**. The purchaser does not have to confirm the receipt of the refund in order for the status to change.

.  A different payment method:
*  The seller carries out the refund.
*  The seller sets the return status to **eBay: Mark refund as sent (non-PayPal)**.  +
→ The event procedure **eBay refund sent** is triggered and the new status is transferred to eBay.
*  The purchaser confirms receipt of the refund in his or her My eBay account.  +
→ The return changes to the status **eBay: return closed**.

[#8700]
====  Full refund without return of the item

This section describes a possible scenario where the customer keeps the item but still receives a full refund. This could be useful if customers want to return low-value items and the amount of work and return expenses are disproportionate to the value of the items.

.  The purchaser requests a return in his or her My eBay account.
.  The return request is imported into plentymarkets and saved with the standard status for returns.

====  Partial refund

This section describes a possible scenario where the customer receives a partial refund. A partial refund could be useful, e.g. if the purchaser initiates a return for an item that has small blemishes or missing accessories.

.  The purchaser requests a return in his or her My eBay account.
.  The return request is imported into plentymarkets and saved with the standard status for returns.
.  The seller checks the reason for return under **Orders » Edit orders » Open return » Tab: Stock units » Note**.

→ The event procedure Offer partial refund is triggered and the status is transferred to eBay.
.  The purchaser accepts the partial payment in his or her My eBay account.  +
→ The return changes to the status **eBay: Partial refund accepted**.
.  The partial refund process depends on which payment method was used by the purchaser:
.  PayPal payment:
*  → The refund amount is directly booked from the seller's PayPal account to the purchaser's PayPal account.  +
→ The return changes to the status **eBay: return closed**. The purchaser does not have to confirm the receipt of the refund in order for the status to change.

.  A different payment method:
*  The seller carries out the partial refund.
*  The seller sets the return status to **eBay: Mark refund as sent (non-PayPal)**.  +
→ The event procedure **eBay refund sent** is triggered and the new status is transferred to eBay.

==  Processing purchase cancellations

eBay's link:http://pages.ebay.co.uk/help/sell/cancel-transaction-process.html#respond[**purchase cancellation**^] function allows buyers to request a cancellation of a purchase within one hour after ordering if the item has not been shipped yet. As a seller, you have three days to accept or reject the request. If you do not process the request within three days, the request is accepted automatically if the buyer has not paid for the item yet. If the buyer already made a payment, the purchase request is rejected automatically.

[#9000]
===  Importing requests

Carry out the following settings to import eBay purchase cancellation requests. After the import, the purchase cancellation status will be displayed in the **<<order-processing/orders/managing-sales-orders#changing-order, Orders » Editing orders>>** menu. The status displayed is the status that you linked to the eBay purchase cancellation status in the **System » Markets » eBay » Settings » Tab: Purchase cancellation** menu. Therefore, you have to link the statuses first.

[.instruction]
Importing purchase cancellation requests automatically:

.  Go to **System » Markets » eBay » Settings**.
.  Click on the **Account settings** tab.
.  Select **Yes** for the **Retrieve eBay purchase cancellations** option.

Changing the order status:

.  Go to **Orders » Edit orders**.
.  Search for orders with the status **[8.5] eBay: Purchase cancellation requested**.
.  Select an order.
.  Change the order's status to **[8.6] eBay: Purchase cancellation accepted**.
. **Save** the settings.  +
→ Create the event procedure described below to automatically inform eBay about your decision.

It might be possible to set up an **<<basics/automation/event-procedures#, event procedure>>** based on your specific workflows that accepts requests automatically using certain filters.

[#9300]
====  Accepting purchase cancellation for outstanding orders

====

[#10100]
==  Synchronising data

The **Data exchange** menu is composed of several tabs. The **Orders** tab allows you to manually import your orders and view orders where the purchaser failed to complete the checkout process on eBay. In the **Listing** tab, you synchronise the listings uploaded on eBay but not yet sold with those in plentymarkets. In the **Other** tab you can manually start various synchronisation processes.

[#10200]
===  Retrieving orders manually

In the **Orders** tab, you manually retrieve orders. This might be necessary if you do not use the automatic retrieval under **<<omni-channel/multi-channel/ebay#60, System » Markets » eBay » Settings>>** or if your token expired and you now want to import the orders from this time period.

[.instruction]
Retrieving orders manually:

.  Go to **System » Markets » eBay » Data exchange**.
.  Click on the **Orders** tab.
.  Select a country from the **Platform** drop-down menu.
.  Use the **from** and **to** fields to select a time period.
.  Click on **Retrieve orders** to import the orders from the selected time period.

[#10300]
===  Importing outstanding orders

Outstanding orders are those orders for which the buyer has not paid yet and thus not yet completed the checkout process on eBay. These orders cannot be found in the <<order-processing/orders/managing-sales-orders#order-search, **Orders**>> menu. You can import outstanding orders so that they become available in the **Orders** menu.

[IMPORTANT]
.Outstanding orders
====
Outstanding orders only occur if the option **Shipping costs for new orders coming from eBay** was set to **Transfer from eBay**. This option is found under <<omni-channel/multi-channel/ebay#260, **System » Listings » Checkout**>>. It is only possible to import outstanding orders within 30 days.
====

[.instruction]
Importing outstanding orders:

.  Go to **System » Markets » eBay » Data exchange**.
.  Click on the **Orders** tab.
.  Select a country from the **Platform** drop-down menu.
.  Select a **payment method** from the drop-down menu.  +
→ The imported order will be assigned to this payment method.
.  Use the **Shipping costs** drop-down menu to select a service offered by the desired shipping service provider.  +
→ The imported order will be assigned to these shipping costs.
.  Activate the **orders** that you want to import.  +
→ If you activate several orders that all belong to the same customer, then these orders will be combined and imported as one order.
.  Click on the **gear-wheel icon** to import the outstanding orders.  +
→ The orders are now available in the <<order-processing/orders/managing-sales-orders#order-search, **Orders**>> menu.

[NOTE]
.Importing and combining orders
====
Several outstanding orders that belong to the same customer will automatically be combined into one order if they are manually imported at the same time. Single orders from different customers can also be selected individually and then be imported. Define a time period for pending orders under **<<omni-channel/multi-channel/ebay#260, Settings » Listings » Checkout>>**. Once this time period has ended, outstanding orders will automatically be imported and combined.
====

[#10400]
=== Synchronising listings and orders

Listings are retrieved on an hourly basis. When retrieving listings from eBay, plentymarkets searches for an existing customer account first to avoid double-entries. If no customer account is found, a new customer account will be created automatically in plentymarkets.

Then, the listing will be assigned to an item. This will run smoothly if the listing on eBay was also listed with plentymarkets or if an item was created with the same title as the listing title. Either a new order will be created or an existing eBay order will be extended. The order will be extended if it fulfils the following criteria:

* Same purchaser and identical delivery address
* Identical payment method
* The order is in **status 1** or **status 3**; or in **status 5** if the payment method is cash on delivery
* The order is not yet marked as **paid** or **carried out**

[TIP]
.Tip
====
If there are differing item names, then you can access the item master data, click on the **Other** tab and enter the listing title for the item under **eBay title**.
====

If orders are found that meet the criteria mentioned above, the **<<omni-channel/multi-channel/ebay#260, shipping costs>>** will be recalculated. There are two calculation types for this:

* The shipping costs are calculated by plentymarkets the way that you defined in the shipping profiles.
* The shipping costs are paid by eBay.

If no matching item can be found, the item ID **-2** is always assigned instead.

[IMPORTANT]
.Transferring the package number
====
If you want to send the package number to eBay as part of the shipping information, then you can enter this number in the **settings** tab of the corresponding eBay order. This information will automatically be sent to eBay.
====

[#10500]
===  Synchronising listings

In the **Listing** tab, you can import GTC offers where the ending date changed, e.g. while your token expired.

[.instruction]
Importing listings:

.  Go to **System » Markets » eBay » Data exchange**.
.  Click on the **Listing** tab.
.  Select an account from the drop-down menu.
.  Select the option **End time** or **Start time**.  +
→ The end time was selected in the example.
.  Use the **from** and **to** fields to select a time period.
.  Click on **Start** to import the listings.

[NOTE]
.Date selection from... to...
====
For example, if you select **End time**, then enter the day when the token expired **+ 30 days** into the **from** field and enter the day when the token was reactivated **+ 30 days** into the **to** field. This will import all GTC offers that were extended during the inactive time and will therefore end during the selected time period.
====

[#10600]
===  Synchronising special sales

Create special sales directly on eBay. Special sales will automatically be synchronised with plentymarkets. If the synchronisation is unexpectedly delayed, then you can manually synchronise the special sales here.

.  Go to **System » Markets » eBay » Data exchange**.
.  Click on the **Other** tab.
.  Select an account from the drop-down menu.
.  Click on **Start** to import the special sales.

[NOTE]
.Manually synchronising special sales with plentymarkets

.  Go to **System » Markets » eBay » Data exchange**.
.  Click on the **Other** tab.

[#11000]
===  Importing eBay listings

In this menu, eBay listings can be directly imported into plentymarkets. In doing so, both a set of item master data and a listing will be created in plentymarkets. You have to carry out specific settings for the import. This not only includes selecting the **eBay account** and the **warehouse**, but also selecting which items should be imported.

[TIP]
.Creating items via data import
====
Items can be created by importing data from eBay. Go to **Data » eBay listings** and carry out the data import. The whole description of the eBay listing will be saved as the item or listing description in plentymarkets. All layout elements (HTML tags etc.) of the listing will be imported. Therefore, you need to manually edit the listing after the import. If you still wish to immediately start your listings on eBay via plentymarkets, simply create a layout template containing only the template function **{% GetItemDescription() %}** and nothing else. This way, the existing description will be used as the listing description without any additional specifications.
====

[.instruction]
Importing eBay listings:

.  Go to **Data » eBay listings**.
.  Carry out the settings as desired. Pay attention to the information given in table 41.
.  Click on **Sync** to import the eBay listings.  +

==  Synchronising data via SOAP API

Use the SOAP API or the **Data exchange** menu to exchange data between your plentymarkets system and eBay. The data format <<basics/data-exchange/data-formats/itemlistingmarketebay#, **ItemListingMarketEbay**>> is used to create new eBay listings or edit existing listings, e.g. to change or delete parameters. In order to link data from the parts compatibility listing to an eBay listing, use the data format <<basics/data-exchange/data-formats/ebaypartsfitment#, **EbayPartsFitment**>>. The data format <<basics/data-exchange/data-formats/ebaytitlematch#, **EbayTitleMatch**>> gives you the possibility of linking an auction's title to specific items.

[#11750]
===  Second Chance Offer

[.instruction]
Is stock taken into consideration or reserved for SCOs?

[.indented]
No, stock is not reserved. You can define a **minimum net stock that will be kept**, but no reservation is made. We recommend that you use the function **End offers automatically**. Go to **System » Listings » Stock** in order to activate this function. Enabling this function means that every 15 minutes, the system will check the stock of active auctions with no stock reservation, as well as the stock of Second Chance Offers. As soon as the stock of the item reaches **0**, the offer will be terminated.[.instruction]
Do I have to pay insertion fees to submit SCOs?

[.indented]
There are no insertion fees for SCOs. You may only need to pay the final value fee in case of a successful sale. For further information about the current prices, refer to the **link:http://pages.ebay.co.uk/help/sell/second_chance_offer.html[help information provided by eBay^]**.[.instruction]
Overselling has become a problem since I started using SCO. How can that be?

[.indented]
Check whether the **End offers automatically** function is activated in the **System » Listings » Stock** menu in your plentymarkets system. Auctions with no stock reservation are only checked every 15 minutes, and SCOs make up a part of these auctions too. If more items than you still have in stock are sold in between two checks, then overselling will result.[.instruction]
How often are Second Chance Offers submitted?

[.indented]
plentymarkets checks the terminated auctions every 15 minutes to see whether SCOs can be submitted for these auctions. This guarantees that SCOs are sent shortly after an auction ended.  +
If there is currently not enough stock, then an error message will be displayed in the SCO overview. If it is determined that there is not enough stock to send SCOs, then they will automatically be sent as soon as new stock is booked into the system. If the stock runs out while sending SCOs, then an error message will be displayed in the SCO overview. Later on, after stock has been booked, you will be able to manually send SCOs to the rest of the defeated bidders (both options are possible up to a maximum of 60 days after the auction ended).[.instruction]
The item is no longer available in the main warehouse but is still available in other warehouses. Will SCOs be submitted?

[.indented]
Yes, the SCO function is based on the total stock from all warehouses.[.instruction]
I upload my items to eBay using attributes without attribute links. My customers select the colour / size in the checkout. Are SCOs also submitted for these items?

[.indented]
Yes. plentymarkets uses the total stock of all item variations for auctions without attribute links. **No reservations** are possible in doing so.[.instruction]
I upload my items to different eBay platforms and use different currencies. Which currency should I define the minimum price for SCOs in?

[.indented]
Always use the standard currency of your online store (go to **System » Orders » Payment » Currencies**). The price that was defined will first be converted into the currency of the auction before an SCO is submitted to a defeated bidder. If no conversion rate was defined for this currency, then an error message will be displayed in the **SCO** menu. Here you can manually submit an SCO afterwards. Please note that the bids in the **SCO** menu are always displayed in the **currency used for the particular auction**.[.instruction]
I receive the error message: No answer, eBay exceeded the maximum response time (limit). What can I do?

[.indented]
It is possible that eBay will temporarily not respond to messages from plentymarkets. The most common reasons are capacity overloads and server or internet connection failures. In this case, try to submit an SCO manually.[.instruction]
I receive the eBay error message #956: Second Chance Offers already sent to all eligible non-winning bidders What can I do?

[.indented]
There is no need to take action. plentymarkets was able to successfully submit an SCO, but the confirmation from eBay has not been received yet (this often occurs in combination with the error message quoted above). It usually takes 30 minutes maximum before this error message disappears and the corresponding eBay SCO auction number is displayed instead.[.instruction]
I receive the internal error:  Net stock of item 2, current SCO of item 1, keep minimum net stock of 1, net stock does not allow further SCOs. What can I do?

[.indented]
Book the missing stock. Then, submit an offer to defeated bidders manually using the **Submit SCO** function.[.instruction]
I receive the internal error:  Unable to convert auction currency into standard currency. Maximum bid of the bidder: USD - Standard currency: EUR. What can I do?

[.indented]
The value entered into the **Second chance offer for minimum bids** field is converted into the currency used for the listing before an SCO is submitted to a defeated bidder. If no conversion factor for this currency was entered in the **System » Orders » Payment » Currencies** menu, this error message will be displayed. Submit an SCO manually afterwards using the **Submit SCO** function. All offers listed in the **System » Markets » eBay » Second Chance Offer** menu will be displayed with the currency of the auction.[#1180]
===  Error messages

[.instruction]
I receive the eBay error message: Your Weekly Selling Activity limits have been exceeded or the error #10117: New seller without credit card on file. What can I do?

[.indented]
You may receive this message if you did not completely finish the process for registering as an eBay seller. In order to register as a seller with eBay, go to the **eBay website » My eBay » Account » Personal information** and change your **account type**. After that, you have to carry out the following steps:  +
- Open the **selling** area.  +
- Carry out the first two steps for listing an item (your entries will be checked automatically in the background).  +
- Abort the process at this point.  +
From then on, you will be registered as a seller and will be able to list your items with plentymarkets.[.instruction]
I receive the error: Error #240. What can I do?

[.indented]
The item cannot be listed or modified. The item title and/or description may contain inadmissible words or the offer may be in violation of eBay policy.  +
Detail 0: You have reached your sales limit and may currently not list any further items. You can list up to 95 items per month. If one of your offers ends and the item has not been sold, you can list other items. For further information about selling limits and how to raise the limit, refer to the **link:http://pages.ebay.co.uk/help/sell/sellinglimits.html[eBay help^]**.  +
You can also call the customer service if you want to increase your selling limit. The quantity for this listing is set to a number higher than **95**. Reduce the quantity to a smaller number, for example **5**, and then restart the listing.[.instruction]
I receive the error: Error # 83. What can I do?

[.indented]
Invalid duration. The duration "GTC" (in days) is not available for this listing type or it is invalid for the category "20349". The duration of 30 days and "GTC" is only available to commercial sellers who have an eBay shop.  +
Information about opening your shop is provided here: link:http://sellercentre.ebay.co.uk/building-your-ebay-shop?cat=36[**http://sellercentre.ebay.co.uk/building-your-ebay-shop?cat=36**^][#1190]
===  Automatic stock update

[.instruction]
What do we have to consider when changing over to the automatic stock update and before activating this function?

[.indented]
This function works with the data entered under **Active listings**. Before activating the automatic function, you have to delete old and unnecessary entries manually. This can potentially be very complex. We recommend using a search filter with duration: **endless (GTC)**, relisted: **no** and stock dependence: **limited (without reservation)**. With these settings, only the listings affected by the automatic stock update will be displayed. Additionally, the only listings that will be updated are those that have the option **Active** selected for listing on eBay. Remember that you have to clean up the section **Active listings** if you change the length of your offers from having specific durations to being **endless (GTC)**. After the change of duration to the listings, new results will be shown here.[.instruction]
I have ended all listings which were relisted accidentally. These offers were now listed again. What can I do?

[.indented]
The effect described is due to the automatic stock update. Deactivate the automatic stock update function.[.instruction]
So far, I have used the plentymarkets endless lister function to keep auctions permanently on eBay. Does the ranking remain the same as well if I keep using this function?

[.indented]
The former function **Endless lister** keeps on creating new listings on eBay without relisting. Therefore, the search ranking is lost when using this function.[.instruction]
Does the automatic function also work for auctions with a different duration?

[.indented]
No, it only works for listings with the duration **endless**.[.instruction]
Do I need to pay for the stock update?

[.indented]
No, the stock can be updated as long as the offer is active. There is no relisting for this offer and therefore no charge to be paid. However, if you are working with the runtime GTC, then you will still need to pay the fees for additional options when eBay automatically prolongs the listing. Insertion fees may only have to be paid again if an expired or ended offer is relisted by the automatic function. For further information about the fees, refer directly to eBay.[.instruction]
How do I exclude an endless lister offer from the automatic stock update?

[.indented]
Deactivate the option **Endless lister**.[.instruction]
I list an item variation on eBay without giving a specific size; end customers select the size in the checkout. Can the automatic stock update be used with these offers?

[.indented]
The automatic stock update cannot be used with these auctions. Use the eBay format **<<omni-channel/multi-channel/ebay#600, Listings with variations>>** instead. The stock information for this offer type is also kept up to date by the automatic stock update.[.instruction]
One of my items was correctly updated by the automatic stock update for a while. However, the offer has not been active on eBay for the last three months because of missing stock. Although I have now booked stock again, it is not relisted. What can I do?

[.indented]
eBay allows relisting of an item for a maximum of 90 days. In order to have the item listed on the platform again, you have to list it manually one time. After that, the item will be covered by the automatic stock update again.[.instruction]
Can I use the listing scheduler for endless listings (GTC)?

[.indented]
Do not use the listing scheduler for these offers as your active listings may be duplicated with this function. Apart from that, it is unnecessary to use the listing scheduler as the offers are listed manually once, afterwards this is not necessary any more.[#12000]
===  Listings with variations

[.instruction]
I receive the error message eBay error #21916601: Invalid tag value(s) in ClosedNameSpace tag(s) size, colour. The offer cannot be started. What can I do?

[.indented]
In this case, eBay does not allow attributes to have the names **size** and **colour**. If you modify these names slightly, you can avoid this prohibition.[.instruction]
When starting the offer, I receive the error message eBay error #21916565: Variation listings must include at least one variation. The offer was not listed - however, the eBay check does not show any errors. What can I do?

[.indented]
There is currently no stock for any of your variations. Therefore, the offer cannot be started.[.instruction]
When updating or restarting the offer, I receive the error message eBay error #21916587: missing name in the variation specifics or variation specifics set. What can I do?

[.indented]
Presumably, one of the item's variations was removed or altered. In this case, it is necessary to list a completely new offer on eBay.[.instruction]
When updating/relisting, I receive the error message eBay error #21916635: Invalid Multi-SKU item ID supplied with variations. What can I do?

[.indented]
Originally, the offer was started without variations. In the meantime, the settings were configured to include variations in the listing. Updating and restarting is not possible under these circumstances. You have to create and publish a completely new offer.[.instruction]
Can I add new variation values, e.g. size: XXXL to an existing and active offer?

[.indented]
Yes, this is possible. Update the active listing with the help of the group function **Update listings** in the section **Active listings**. If you activated the automatic stock update for endless listings, then this operation will be carried out automatically.[.instruction]
I activated the option best offer. However, this setting does not work for my variation listings. What can I do?

[.indented]
So far, it is not possible to use the option **Best offer** for variation listings on eBay.[.instruction]
When updating/relisting, I receive the error message eBay error #21916626: Variations Specifics and Item Specifics entered for a Multi-SKU item should be different. What can I do?

[.indented]
For offers including variations, it is not permitted to define the **eBay item properties** (usually **colour** and **size**) with the same name. This is a malfunction on the part of eBay, as the listing should not be listed at all if changes or a relisting will cause error messages later on.[.instruction]
I receive the error message EbayReviseItem: eBay error #21916664: The variation specifics entered do not match with the variation specifics of the variations on the item. What can I do?

[.indented]
This means that you have changed the existing item variations. You are not allowed to change the names of variations once the active listing has been purchased. You are then only allowed to add variations or change the price or stock.[.instruction]
I receive the error message EbayReviseItem: eBay error #21916585: Duplicate custom variation label. Or eBay error #21916586: Duplicate name-value combination in variation specifics. What can I do?

[.indented]
Open the editing window of the item and click on **Edit attribute link** and **Edit variation numbers**. Save the attribute settings here.
