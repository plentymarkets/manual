The RKSV stipulates what you need to do if the POS's signature unit fails temporarily or permanently.

* If possible, move on to a POS with a functional signature unit.
* If no other POS is available, you can use the POS with the defect signature unit. All receipts are marked *Sicherheitseinrichtung ausgefallen* (Security unit failed).
* Once the signature unit is functional again, a collective receipt is created and printed in plentymarkets POS automatically.

These are recommendations that can help you adhere to the RKSV. Check with your supervisor how to proceed if the signature unit fails.

=== Creating a Kontrollbeleg (control receipt) for tax authorities (Austria only)

In the case of a POS inspection by Austrian tax authorities, you need to be able to generate a zero amount control receipt (Kontrollbeleg) on the spot. This control receipt allows tax inspectors to validate the signature on the POS receipts on site in your store using an app. You do not need any additional user rights to create a control receipt.
