== Saving booking accounts for plentymarkets POS events

Orders generated in plentymarkets POS are assigned to the <<order-processing/orders/accounting#800, revenue accounts>> saved in plentymarkets.

=== Saving booking accounts for till count discrepancies

If the actual cash on hand differs from the expected cash on hand after the count, you either need to balance the discrepancy or book the difference.

=== Specifying rounding behaviour for POS orders

Totals are always shown with 2 decimal places on plentymarkets POS receipts. However, the settings in the plentymarkets back end determine if order prices are rounded to 2 decimal places or if 4 decimal places are used for calculations. The rounding behaviour for orders generated in plentymarkets POS is determined by the following 3 options:

.Options to set rounding behaviour for POS orders
[cols="10,1,1"]
|====
|Menu |Option |Possible settings

|System » Client » Select client » Locations » Select location » Accounting
|Number of decimal places
a|
* 2
* 4

|System » Client » Select client » Locations » Select location » Accounting
|Round totals only
a|
* Yes
* No

|System » Client » Select client » POS » Open POS » Tab: Receipt
|List identical order items
a|
* Individually
* In aggregate
|====

These settings result in 6 combinations of settings:

* Show order items individually, round individual prices to 2 decimal places
* Show order items individually, round individual prices to 4 decimal places
* Show order items individually, round totals to 4 decimal places
* Show order items in aggregate, round individual prices to 2 decimal places
* Show order items in aggregate, round individual prices to 4 decimal places
* Show order items in aggregate, round totals to 4 decimal places

Total sums differ depending on the settings you select. Note that these discrepancies increase the more sums requiring rounding are present in a POS order.

==== Example calculation

<<table-POS-rounding>> shows an example calculation that illustrates rounding discrepancies resulting from different combinations of settings.

The example calculation is based on the following data:

. Calculation base: Item at a price of 4.545 GBP
. Calculation 1: 10 items sold
. Calculation 2: 10 items sold at 5% discount

== Creating a default customer for POS orders

For POS orders to be saved in plentymarkets correctly, every order must be associated with a customer. As such, you need to create an anonymous default user for casual customers. Proceed as described to create a default customer for POS orders. Only settings necessary to configure the default customer for POS orders are described. For general information about creating customers, refer to the <<crm/managing-customer-data#, Managing customer data>> page of the manual.

[IMPORTANT]

== Creating a dummy item

You may find that items are to be sold for which no data record exists in plentymarkets. For instance, it is often too labour intensive to create data records for miscellaneous items or remnants. Create a dummy item to be able to sell these items anyway. POS users can then add the dummy item to the POS shopping cart and modify the price and/or the name of the order item.

The following preparations are required to work with dummy items.

* Create a dummy item for each VAT rate you need for your product portfolio. As such, if you sell items with 19% and 7% VAT, you need two dummy items.
* Activate the option *Query price if price is 0* so POS users can enter the price manually.
* Assign POS users the right to edit prices.
* Assign POS users the right to rename order items (optional).

The required settings are described in <<table-POS-dummy-item>>. The subheadings indicate the menu in which the settings are carried out.

== Preparing gift card sales

You can sell and redeem gift cards in plentymarkets POS gift cards. When you sell a gift card item, you provide customers with a gift card code. Customers only can redeem a gift card code if their gift card code is saved in the plentymarkets back end at the time the customer tries to redeem it. You either can generate gift card codes automatically or work with your own gift card codes.

The following preparations in the plentymarkets back end are necessary to sell gift cards via plentymarkets POS.

* Create a coupon campaign of the type **Gift card**.
* Create a free text field for the campaign and link it in the *System » Orders » Coupons* menu.
* Create gift card items with a VAT rate of 0% and link them to the coupon campaign.
* *_Optional:_* Generate gift card codes or save your own gift card codes in the back end.
* *_Optional:_* Create gift card templates and make them available to POS users.
* *_Optional:_* Make gift card codes available to POS users.

These steps are described below. Find more detailed information on campaigns and gift cards on the <<order-processing/orders/coupons#, Coupons>> page of the manual.

[NOTE]
.More than one POS
====
Do you have more than one POS and create your own gift card codes? Divide the printed gift card codes between the different POS or create a separate gift card campaign and gift card items to make sure that each gift card code is sold only once.
====

=== Preparing the free text field

To sell gift cards, you need to link the gift card item to a free text field. You define this free text field and assign it to a coupon campaign. A free text field needs to be defined only once.

[#820]
==== Defining the free text field

Define the free text field to be used for campaigns.

[.instruction]
Defining the free text field:

. Go to **System » Item » Free text fields**.
. In the *Field name* field, enter **Kampagne ID**. +
*_Note:_* Pay attention to the correct spelling. The name **Kampagne ID** is valid only as specified here.
. Select the data type **number**.
. Enter the character length.
. **Save** the settings. +
→ The free text field is activated over night and available the next day.

==== Selecting a free text field

Now, go to **System » Orders » Coupons**. Select this free text field and link it to a coupon campaign. You only need to do this once for all campaigns.

[.instruction]
Selecting a free text field:

. Go to **System » Orders » Coupons**.
. Select the campaign field **Campaign ID** from the drop-down list.
. **Save** the settings. +
→ The **Kampagne ID** field is shown in the <<item/managing-items#75, Fields>> tab of the item.

[#830]
=== Creating a campaign for POS gift cards

Now, create one or several campaigns for selling gift cards in plentymarkets POS. You have the following options:

* You create one campaign for all gift cards you sell in plentymarkets POS.
* You create one campaign for each gift card value. +
*_Example:_* You want to sell gift cards for 10 GBP, 25 GBP and 50 GBP and a gift card with a flexible value that POS users enter during the transaction. As such, you create 3 campaigns with the discount values 10, 25 and 50 GBP and a campaign with an amount of your choice.

If you operate more than one POS and want to use your own gift card codes it also may make sense to create separate campaigns for each POS. Proceed as described below to create a campaign for gift cards:

[.instruction]
Creating a campaign for POS gift cards:

. Go to **Orders » Coupons**.
. Click on **New campaign**.
. Carry out the settings. Note <<table-POS-gift-card-campaigns>>.
. **Save** the settings. +
→ The new campaign is created and appears in the overview.

|====
|Setting |User input

2+|Campaign

|**Name**
|Enter a name for the campaign. +
*_Tip_*: The name should contain the name of the POS and the gift card value if applicable.

|**Description**

[#850]
=== Managing gift card codes

To redeem gift cards in plentymarkets POS, POS users enter the gift card code. A gift card code must be present in the plentymarkets back end at the time it is redeemed.

From the point of view of POS users, the configuration options in plentymarkets result in three possible scenarios:

* The POS generates gift card codes automatically
* The POS user is issued with a list of gift card codes for each gift card value that have been saved in plentymarkets. The POS user enters one of these codes when selling a gift card. The value of the gift card code is retrieved.
* The POS user is issued with a list of gift card codes that have not been saved in plentymarkets. The POS user enters a code and a value.

==== Automatically generating gift card codes at POS

Administratively, it is easiest if POS users generate a <<omni-channel/pos/plentymarkets-pos-for-pos-users#250, random gift card code>> when they sell a gift card in plentymarkets POS. When the POS order is uploaded, the gift card code and the associated gift card value are then imported to the campaign that is linked to the gift card item. The gift card code is printed on the receipt. In addition, POS users can write the gift card code on a decorative gift card.

==== Working with your own gift card codes

Your administrative work increases if you want to hand out gift card codes to POS users for them to enter when they sell items. However, it also has advantages. For instance, you can create decorative gift cards that already contain the gift card code or the gift card code and the gift card value. POS users can then simply hand out these gift cards.

You can save gift card codes in the system either before or during a sale.

Before a sale in the plentymarkets back end:

* You generate gift card codes with fixed values in a campaign before you start selling gift cards.
* You save gift card codes with fixed values in a campaign before you start selling gift cards.

In both cases, you provide POS users with a list of these gift card codes and the gift card value associated with them.

During a sale in plentymarkets POS:

* POS users enter a gift card code that is not yet saved in plentymarkets and the associated gift card value when selling a gift card.

In such cases, you provide POS users with a list of gift card codes. POS users enter the gift card value during the transaction. This value becomes the price at which the gift card is sold.

[NOTE]
.Take note of creation date
====
You have handed out gift card codes generated in plentymarkets to POS users already and want to generate additional gift card codes? Then take note of the gift card codes' creation dates. Gift card codes are not flagged as sold in plentymarkets. To ensure that each gift card code is only sold once, only circulate the codes you created on a particular date. We recommend that you generate gift card codes in the **Orders » Coupons** menu and export these gift card codes to a CSV file. Filter the CSV file by the creation date, i.e. the column *GeneratedOn*. This leaves you with a list of the newly created gift card codes.
====

==== Generate gift card codes manually

Use the coupon generator in the **Codes** tab of a campaign to create one or more gift card codes automatically.

[.instruction]
Generating gift card codes with a fixed value:

. Go to **Orders » Coupons**.
. Click on the campaign for which you want to generate gift card codes.
. Click on the **Codes** tab.
. In the **Generate gift card codes manually** area to the left, enter the number of gift card codes you want to generate.
. *_Optional:_* In the **Value** field, enter the value to be assigned to the gift card code. +
*_Tip:_* If you leave the **Value** field empty, the discount value of the campaign is assigned.
. **Save** the data. +
→ The gift card codes are created and added to the list of gift card codes.
. Click on *Export* to export the gift card codes. +
→ A CSV export of all gift card codes of the campaign is created.
. Filter the *GeneratedOn* column of the CSV file by the current date. This results in a list of all newly created gift card codes. +
. Provide POS users with the gift card codes and their value. +
*_Note:_* Do not circulate duplicate gift card codes. If you operate more than one POS, either split the gift card codes or create separate campaigns for each POS.

==== Saving your own gift card codes with a fixed value

Instead of generating gift card codes in plentymarkets, you also can save your own gift card codes in plentymarkets before selling them. Valid characters for gift card codes are lower and upper case letters, numbers, underscores (_) and hyphens (-).

[.instruction]
Saving your own gift card codes with a fixed value:

. Go to **Orders » Coupons**.
. Click on the campaign for which you want to generate a gift card code.
. Click on the **Codes** tab.
. In the **Enter gift card code manually** area to the right, enter a code with 6 to 24 characters.
. **Save** the data. +
→ The gift card code is saved and added to the list of gift card codes. +
*_Tip:_* Use the data format **CampaignCoupon** to import several gift card codes at once. The **Discount value** is imported as the gift card value. As such, you need to create one campaign for each gift card value if you want to use the data format.
. Provide POS users with the gift card codes and their value. +
*_Note:_* Do not circulate duplicate gift card codes. If you operate more than one POS, either split the gift card codes or create separate campaigns for each POS.

[#840]
=== Creating a gift card item

Now, create one or more gift card items. Because the campaign ID is linked at the item level, you cannot use variations to create gift cards. For further information about creating items, refer to the <<item/managing-items#, Managing items>> page of the manual. Only settings needed for creating gift card items are described here.

==== Creating gift card items with a fixed value

POS users are not prompted to enter a price when selling gift card items with a fixed price. This speeds up the transaction but also offers less flexibility.

When working with existing gift card codes:

* The value of the existing gift card code must match the price of the item. As such, the gift card item must be linked to the campaign with the gift card codes of the correct values. If you create one campaign for each gift card value, each campaign is linked to one item only. If you create a campaign with different gift card values, this campaigns is linked to more than one gift card item.

[.instruction]
Creating gift card items with a fixed value:

. Go to **Item » Edit item**.
. Click on **New**. +
→ The **New item** tab opens.
. Select the type **Default**.
. Enter a name. +
*_Tip_*: The name should include the gift card value.
. Enter the content **1 piece**.
. Select a category.
. Select a sales price from the drop-down list. +
*_Note_*: The sales price must be linked to the order referrer of the POS.
. Enter the gift card value as the price.
. **Save** the settings. +
→ The item is created and opened for editing.
. Carry out the additional settings. Note <<table-POS-gift-cards-item-settings>>.
. **Save** the settings.


==== Creating gift card items with a flexible value

Gift card items with flexible value are items with a price of 0.00 GBP. You can control the price at which these gift cards are sold at the POS in two different ways:

* POS users enter a gift card code saved in plentymarkets. The value of the gift card code becomes the price of the gift card.
* POS users either generate a code or save a gift card code and enter the gift card value.

[.instruction]
Creating a gift card item with a flexible price:

. Go to **Item » Edit item**.
. Click on **New**. +
→ The **New item** tab opens.
. Select the type **Default**.
. Enter a name.
. Enter the content **1 piece**.
. Select a category.
. Select a sales price from the drop-down list. +
*_Note_*: The sales price must be linked to the order referrer of the POS.
. Enter a price of **0.00** GBP.
. **Save** the settings. +
→ The item is created and opened for editing.
. Carry out the additional settings. Note <<table-POS-gift-cards-item-settings>>.
. **Save** the settings. +
→ *_With existing gift card code:_* POS users enter a gift card code of the campaign linked to this item. The item is billed at the value of the gift card code. +
→ *_Without existing gift card code:_* POS users are prompted to enter a price when they place the item in the POS shopping basket.

== Printing POS receipts on other printers

By default, all POS receipts are printed on the receipt printer that you specify in the *plentymarkets App » Settings » POS* menu, option *Receipt printer*. However, you can also print POS receipts on other printers. For example, you might like to print receipts that need to be archived for longer periods on an A4 printer instead of on a thermal printer.

To use additional printers, you need a printer that can be accessed via the network that is connected to one or more printers on which you want to print the POS receipts. On this computer, you install the plugin link:https://marketplace.plentymarkets.com/en/plugins/integration/plentyBase_5053[plentyBase^]. plentyBase establishes a connection between the plentymarkets app and the local computer. This allows the POS to access any printers that the local computer can also access. Go to the plentymarkets back end menu *System » Settings » Printers* to configure these printers.

[TIP]
.Receipt printer does not require plentyBase
====
The receipt printer is connected to the plentymarkets app via the printer’s IP address. As such, you do not need plentyBase to operate the receipt printer. This means that you only need plentyBase if you want to use other printers with plentymarkets POS.
====

[#1010]
=== Installing and setting up plentyBase

plentyBase is a plugin developed by plentymarkets. Unlike many other plentymarkets plugin, plentyBase is not activated in the plentymarkets back end. Instead, plentyBase you install and run plentyBase on a local computer. plentyBase establishes an interface that allows you to use the printers that are connected to the computer in the plentymarkets back end and/or the plentymarkets app.

The following steps are necessary to make the printers available to the plentymarkets app:

* plentyBase must be installed on the computer. +
→ To download the installation file, go to the link:https://marketplace.plentymarkets.com/en/plugins/integration/plentyBase_5053[plentyMarketplace^].
* plentyBase must be configured on the computer. +
→ Find out how to configure plentyBase in the plugin description of the plugin link:https://marketplace.plentymarkets.com/en/plugins/integration/plentyBase_5053#140.[plentyBase^].
*_Note:_* During configuration, activate the option *HTTP server*. This ensures that plentymarkets POS can communicate with plentyBase.
* plentyBase must be running on the computer. +
*_Recommendation:_* Configure plentyBase to run automatically when the computer is started up.
* The plentyBase connection data must be saved in the plentymarkets app: +
→ Find out how to save the plentyBase connection data in the plugin description of the plugin link:https://marketplace.plentymarkets.com/en/plugins/integration/plentyBase_5053#140.[plentyBase^].
* The printers must be configured in the plentymarkets back end menu *System » Settings » Printers*.

== Operating plentymarkets POS in Austria

According to the Cash Register Directive (Registrierkassensicherheitsverordnung, RKSV) points of sale located in Austria must be equipped with a technical signature unit that ensures that POS transaction data is temper-proof, i.e. undeletable and uneditable. The QR code on the POS receipts provides visual proof that the POS is tamper-proof. Find out how to put a POS in operation in Austria.

[#870]
=== Overview: Implementing the POS

For POS located in Austria, the steps described in <<table-activating-POS-Austria>> are necessary to activate the signature unit required by the RKSV. Check the website of the link:https://english.bmf.gv.at/taxation/Cash_register_folder.html[Austrian Federal Ministry of Finance^] for detailed information on these legal requirements. This page of the manual describes only those steps necessary to implement a plentymarkets POS located in Austria. This description does not form legal or fiscal advice.

|====

[IMPORTANT]
.Existing POS in Austria
====
Existing POS cannot be made tamper-proof. If you already operate a plentymarkets POS point of sale in Austria, you need to create a new POS and decommission the old POS.
====

[#900]
=== Creating the start receipt (Austria)

Now create the start receipt (Startbeleg) to put the POS into operation. You need the PIN of the signature certificate to create the start receipt. You should have received this PIN from your certificate service provider (Vertrauensdiensteanbieter) together with your signature card. Go to the POS menu of the plentymarkets app to create the start receipt. After the start receipt is created, the location country of the POS cannot be changed.

[.instruction]
Creating the start receipt (Startbeleg):

. Open the plentymarkets App.
. Go to **plentymarkets App » Settings » POS**.
. Enter the PIN of the signature certificate. You should have received this PIN from your certificate service provider (Vertrauensdiensteanbieter) together with your signature card.
. Tap **Create start receipt**. +
→ The start receipt is printed. +
→ The start receipt is saved in the cash journal and in the document archive. +
→ You can start using the POS. +
→ Receipts contain the electronic signature and the QR code. +
→ Transactions are saved in the data export protocol (DEP).

[#880]
=== Documenting POS transactions for Austrian tax authorities

The Austrian Registrierkassensicherheitsverordnung (RKSV) stipulates that receipts must be electronically signed and furnished with a QR code. This QR code contains all relevant receipt data, an encrypted revenue counter and information on the previous receipt. This reference to the previous receipt ensures that preceding receipts cannot be manipulated or deleted. In addition, a data collection protocol (Datenerfassungsprotokoll, DEP) must be kept for each POS. You need to be able to export this DEP to a local storage medium at any time.

plentymarkets provides several export formats to allow you to comply with these legal requirements. These exports are designed to conform to German tax laws. Talk to your tax consultant to determine what data you need to export and archive to comply with local tax laws.

[#890]
==== Creating a DEP export

According to §7 of the Austrian Registrierkassensicherheitsverordnung (RKSV), a data collection protocol (Datenerfassungsprotokoll, DEP) must be kept for every POS. At a minimum, the DEP must contain the signatures of any receipts resulting from cash sales and cash cancellations. The concatenation of the receipt signatures means that the DEP data is temper-proof. A separate DEP must be kept for each POS.

The DEP report is exported as a JSON file. It contains the following receipt data:

* Receipt group (Beleg-Gruppe)
* Signature certificate
* Certification authorities (Zertifizierungsstellen)
* Compact receipts (Belege-kompakt)

You must be able to export the DEP of a POS to an external disk and hand it over to tax inspectors at any time. Proceed as described below to create a DEP export:

[.instruction]
Exporting the DEP files:

. Go to **Orders » POS » DEP export**.
. Select the client (store).
. Select the POS.
. Select the first date of the range you want to export.
. Select the last date of the range you want to export.
. Click on *Download*. +
→ The file is saved in the default download folder set for the browser. +
*_Tip:_* The file name contains the export range, e.g. the file depExport_9-1-2017-9-2-2017.json contains data from the 9th of January to the 9th of February 2017.

==== Creating a Z2 receipt (Austria)

A Z2 receipt is a monthly signed control receipt with an amount of zero (0.00 Euro). The RKSV requires you to create a Z2 receipt at the end of each month. The Z2 report for the month of December also serves as an end of year report. You need to print and archive this yearly receipt every year and scan the barcode with the BMF receipt validation app.

===== Assigning users the right to create Z2 receipts

Users with admin rights are able to create Z2 receipts by default. *Variable* users must be assigned this right.

[.instruction]
Assigning users the right to create Z2 receipts:

. Go to *System » Settings » User*.
. Open the account of the user.
. Click on the *Right* tab.
. Click on the *Mobile* tab.
. In the *POS functions* section, activate the right *Z2 receipt (AT)*.
. *Save* the settings. +
→ The POS user <<omni-channel/pos/plentymarkets-pos-for-pos-users#270, can create Z2 receipts in plentymarkets POS>>.


=== SOS: The signature unit has failed. What do I need to do?

The RKSV stipulates how you need to proceed if the signature unit of your POS fails:

* If your signature unit fails, you need to move on to a POS with a functioning signature unit.
* If no other POS is available, you can temporarily use the one with the failed signature unit.
* If the signature unit fails for more than 48 hours, you need to inform the tax authorities about the beginning and end of the failure via FinanzOnline within a week.
* All unsigned receipts must be marked *Signatureinrichtung ausgefallen* (Signature unit failed). +
→ In plentymarkets POS, receipts are marked with this text automatically if the signature unit fails.
* As soon as the signature unit functions again, a collective receipt (Sammelbeleg) must be created. The signature of this receipt must contain all transactions that were generated with the POS while the signature unit was not in operation. +
→ plentymarkets POS creates a collective receipt automatically once the signature unit functions again.

[#930]
=== Creating a Kontrollbeleg (control receipt) for tax authorities

In the case of a POS inspection by Austrian tax authorities, you need to be able to generate a zero amount control receipt (Kontrollbeleg) on the spot. This control receipt allows tax inspectors to validate the signature on the POS receipts on site in your store using an app. All POS users can create such a <<omni-channel/pos/plentymarkets-pos-for-pos-users#270, control receipt on demand>>. No additional user rights are necessary to create the control receipt.

[#920]
=== Decommissioning a POS (Austria)

To permanently decommission a POS located in Austria, you need to create an end receipt. An end receipt is an electronically signed control receipt with an amount of zero (0.00). An end receipt can be created for POS for which a start receipt has already been created. Go to the POS menu of the plentymarkets app to create the end receipt. Once an end receipt is created, the POS can no longer be operated.

[.instruction]
