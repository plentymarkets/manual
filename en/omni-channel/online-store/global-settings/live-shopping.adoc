[WARNING]
.Price if the remaining quantity is exceeded
====
At some point, a buyer may try to order more copies of an item than are still available in the live shopping offer. If this happens, then the normal item price will be used for the entire order. Example: There are 7 copies of a live shopping item remaining. A customer puts 8 copies of the live shopping item into their shopping cart. All 8 copies of the item will be sold at the normal sales price.

Advise customers of this fact and make sure that they can always see how many items are still available at a reduced price as part of the live shopping offer.
