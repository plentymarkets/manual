== picalike

picalike is a tool for comparing images. It helps your customers in the search for appropriate items. +
Item images become more and more important in e-commerce. With picalike, you extend your *property search function* (filtering according to price, gender, category etc.) by another dimension: *similarity*. This will bring a completely new shopping experience to your store visitors. +
picalike analyzes your item images and builds up an index of similarities between them. If a store visitor filters according to similarity, then picalike will be informed which image should be used as a reference and it will then show similar images in a list.

== Registering with picalike

Get in touch with picalike and sign up for the image search. Please pay attention to the following points:

* You will find detailed information about *functions* and *costs* on the picalike website. Clarify these details before you activate picalike in plentymarkets.
* picalike needs to have your plentymarkets system's *export URL* for the image search. Go to *System » Client » Settings » Services » picalike* to find the URL (image 2).
* You need the picalike *API KEY* for activation. This key is saved in the *Setup* menu of your picalike admin area (image 1).

Integrating the picalike image search in the template:

. Go to *CMS » Web design » Layout » ItemView » ItemViewSingleItem*.
. Insert the following code at a suitable position: +
*&lt;a id="link_picalike_$ID" href="{% Link_PicalikeSearch(1) %}" rel="nofollow"&gt;Search for similar images&lt;/a&gt;* +
→ The text *Search for similar images* will be displayed as a link in the online store. You can replace the text with any other preferred text.
. *Save* the settings.

== Integrating an image search with several images

If you want to have a selection of several item images, then you need to add an "onclick" event to each one of them.

[IMPORTANT]
.onClick command
====
The onclick command consists of the following information: +
*onClick="document.getElementById('link_picalike_$ID').href='[Link_PicalikeSearch_5]';" +
⇒ 5* = Item image number 5
====

Onclick events are separated from each other with semicolons.

Every image in the item layout needs to have an individual link. These links are numbered consecutively. +
LinkTo_PicalikeSearch_2 +
LinkTo_PicalikeSearch_3 +
LinkTo_PicalikeSearch_4 +
etc.

Consequently, the code for the second item image is:

*onClick="document.getElementById('link_picalike_$ID').href='{% Link_PicalikeSearch(2) %}';"*

[.instruction]
Integrating the picalike item search with several images into the template:

. Go to *CMS » Web design » Layout » ItemView » ItemViewSingleItem*.
. Insert the respective code for the additional item images as shown in image 3.
. *Save* the settings.

In *image 3*, you can see where the code for item image 2 will be inserted (arrow): in front of the triangular bracket.

Proceed in the same way for any additional images.
