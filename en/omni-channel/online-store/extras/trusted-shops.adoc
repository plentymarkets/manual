link:http://www.trustedshops.com/[*Trusted Shops*^] is the well-known trustmark for online stores which provides buyer protection for online customers.

[#10]
== Trusted Shops buyer protection

You need to carry out two steps to integrate the Trusted Shops buyer protection. In the first step, select the buyer protection model and configure it to be displayed to the customer during the checkout process. Most customers choose the free *Trusted Shops _Basic_* model. However, you can also use the *Trusted Shops _PLUS_* model. In the second step, *insert* the *Trusted Shops Trustbadge* into your online store.

[#20]
=== Buyer protection models

*Trusted Shops _PLUS_* offers protection for orders with a total value of up to 20,000 Euro. A small fee is charged for this service. *Trusted Shops _PLUS_* treats buyer protection like an item that has been placed in the shopping cart. This means that buyer protection is automatically activated upon completion of the purchase. If you want to use this buyer protection model, you have to order it at Trusted Shops. The configuration is described in the following sections.

*Trusted Shops _Basic_* is free of charge. Purchases with a value of up to 2,500 Euro can be protected. The buyer protection model is offered to customers directly after they have made their purchase.

If a valid Trusted Shops ID was saved, customers will see a button they can click to register for buyer protection during the order confirmation. Customers who click on the button will be forwarded to Trusted Shops. For further information about saving the Trusted Shops ID in plentymarkets, refer to section 3 of this page.

*Please note the following:*

* The form for buyer protection registration is only shown on the day of the purchase.
* The form will be hidden for purchases made on eBay and other markets.

[WARNING]
.Trusted Shops ID
====
If an error should occur here, please note that it is not possible to activate a Trusted Shops ID for the same domain but for different languages. However, this is not the case when activating a Trusted Shop ID for a client (store) that is located on a subdomain (e.g. "test.test-store.com"). For further information, refer to link:https://www.trustedshops.co.uk/merchants/[*Trusted Shops*^] and the link:http://www.trustedshops.co.uk/merchants/service.html#topic=ratings[*Trusted Shops FAQ*^]. The *Trusted Shops IDs* which you save here form the basis for the Trusted Shops Trustbadge and the buyer protection. A Trusted Shops ID is only valid for an online store certified by Trusted Shops as well as for a specific language.

=== Integrating the Trusted Shops Seller Rating

Once you have <<omni-channel/online-store/extras/trusted-shops#, *activated the seller ratings*>>, integrate them into your online store. Use <<omni-channel/online-store/cms-syntax#basics-template-variables, *template variables*>> in the *CMS* menu to do so. The Trusted Shops variables are listed under the *_global variables_* in the *PageDesignTemplateVars* folder. They are also listed on the <<omni-channel/online-store/cms-syntax#web-design-pagedesign, *PageDesign*>> page of the manual.

[#80]
==== Template variables

If a *Trusted Shops ID* is activated, you can integrate the *template variables* (widget and "Write a review!" buttons) into your online store - according to the language of the design.

[TIP]
.Tip: Using the integration handbook
====
Refer to the Trusted Shops Seller Rating integration handbook when integrating the template variables. The *$TrustedShopsRatingEmailButton* variable is the "Write a review!" button for system emails and the order confirmation page. The button is included in the plentymarkets layout by default and is displayed in the order overview. You can integrate the Trusted Shops variables into any design. The customer's *email address* and the *order ID* will automatically be transferred over to the review form.
====

[WARNING]
.Make note of the language
====
If the seller rating is not activated for the corresponding design language or if the language was not booked with Trusted Shops, the template variables will not be displayed or they will be empty.
====

[#90]
==== Trusted Rating widget for the online store

_Image 3: *Trusted Rating widget* for the online store_

[TIP]
.Tip
====
You can configure the widget's *height*, *width*, *comments* and *branding* in the link:https://www.trustedshops.com/en/shop/login.html[*Trusted Shops System*^].
====

[WARNING]
.Seller ratings
====
The seller ratings are not displayed in real time. The widget graphic is reloaded once a day (at night). The widget, as shown in image 3, will only be displayed after 60 seller ratings have been received. Before this point, the *$TrustedShopsRatingShopButton* template variable will be replaced by a "Write a review!" button (image 4).
====

[#100]
==== Write a review! button for system emails and the order confirmation page: +
$TrustedShopsRatingEmailButton

image::omni-channel/online-store/extras/_trusted-shops/assets/EN-Marketing-Trusted-Shops-Seller-Rating-02.png[]

_Image 4: example "Write a review! button_

Use the variable *$TrustedShopsRatingEmailButton* in the store's *CMS* and in email templates. For example, it makes sense to use the variable in a reminder email that you send to your customers and ask them to rate your store. Learn how to automate this reminder below.

[.instruction]
Configuring a seller rating reminder:

. Go to <<basics/automation/procedure-manager#, *Settings » Orders » Procedure manager*>>.
. Go to the *New procedure* tab.
. Go to the *Procedure* tab within the new procedure.
. Use the *Send email template* option to select an email template from the drop-down menu. The template should invite customers to rate your store and should contain the corresponding template variable. +
→ Create the <<crm/sending-emails#1200, *email template*>> under *Settings » Client (store) » Standard » Email » Templates*.
. Go to the *Filter* tab.
. Select a *status*, e.g. *Outgoing items booked*.
. Select an option for the *last status change*, e.g. 14 days ago.
. Go to the *Settings* tab.
. Place a check mark next to the option *Active* to activate the procedure.
. *Save* the settings.

In this example, your customers would be sent an email 14 days after their items were shipped. The email would ask customers to submit a seller rating with Trusted Shops.

[WARNING]
.Pay attention to the market's terms and conditions
====
Understand the particular market's terms and conditions before you set up a function in your online store that requests a seller rating. Some markets only allow you to request seller ratings if specific requirements are met. Some markets do not permit this at all. Exclude markets by not selecting them with the *Order referrer* option in the *Filter* tab.
====

[IMPORTANT]
.Plain text link in plain text emails
====
If the template variable is integrated into an email template that is configured as being *plain text only*, the email will only contain the link as plain text. It will not contain an additional graphic. In this case, be sure to tell customers what this link is for, e.g. *Rate our store! ($TrustedShopsRatingEmailButton)*.
====

[TIP]
.Buttons in emails
====
Some email programs, e.g. Mozilla Thunderbird, do not display graphics directly in emails. If you see text displayed instead of a graphic despite the fact that you defined the email as having *only text in HTML format*, then check whether the email program may have incorrectly downloaded the graphics. The link to the ratings should still work when clicking on the alternative text.
====

=== Setting up Rich Snippets for Google

Rich Snippets help display detailed information in search engines. Edit your store's *CMS* in order to display your store's Trusted Shops Seller Rating in Google search results.

Open the *CMS* menu and insert the following code in the *PageDesignContentMainFrame* template.

[cols=""]

[source,xml]
----
<a href="http://www.trustedshops.de/shop-info/trusted-shops-kundenbewertungen/"Trusted Shops Seller Ratings</a>:

== Integrating the Trusted Shops Trustbadge in your online store

Check the *requirements* for the integration of the Trusted Shops Trustbadge:

* You have saved a valid Trusted Shops ID in the *Trustbadge* tab as described in section 2.
* You have configured the Trustbadge and saved the Trustbadge as well as the background graphic on your computer.

[.instruction]
Integrating the Trusted Shops Trustbadge in your online store:

. Go to *Settings » Client (store) » Standard » Services » Trusted Shops*.
. Go to the *Trustbadge* tab.
. Go to *CMS » Image gallery*.
. Open the desired folder.
. Click on *Upload files* and upload the *Trusted Shops Trustbadge* from your local hard drive to your plentymarkets system. If desired, load the *background graphic* as well.
. Copy the *Trustbadge's URL* (Ctrl or cmd + C). In the HTML editing window of the *Trustbadge* tab, mark the URL behind *src=* and enter the URL from the clipboard there (Ctrl or cmd + V).
. Copy the *URL of the background graphic* and insert it into the HTML editing window instead of the URL behind the HTML entry *background-image: url* in the HTML code.
. Use relative path specifications (without "http://www.your-store.com/") as shown in the image below. This means you have to delete the path up to *images*. If you want to use the Trustbadge in HTML email templates too, use absolute path specifications (including "http://www.your-store.com/"). Otherwise the graphics can not be accessed.
. *Save* the settings.
