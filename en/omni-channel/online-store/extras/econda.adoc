The following table explains the settings in the **Assignment** area:

[cols="a,a"]
|====
|Setting |Explanation

|**Use site IDs**
|If the check mark has been placed, then a **site ID** will be attached to the data that is transferred to econda. By using this **site ID**, the econda Shop Monitor can tell how the data should be assigned. The client (store) ID is the default value for this ID (0 = main store; 1,2,3 ... = client 1,2,3 ...)

|**User-defined site ID**
|If the check mark has been placed and a **user-defined site ID** has been created, then this **user-defined site ID** will be transferred instead of the default store ID. Don't forget to place a check mark next to **use site IDs** anyway. +
**Tip:** If you would like several clients (stores) to be analyzed in the same round of tracking, then activate the **user-defined site ID** for the respective clients (place a check mark).

Take a look at the template for the search responses. Enter the tag **&lt;PLENTY_TOTAL_RESULTS&gt;****{$TOTAL_RESULTS}****&lt;/PLENTY_TOTAL_RESULTS&gt;**. This method also works if you have activated the option **plenty** as the **search results design**.
