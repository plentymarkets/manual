== General information about the Trusted Shops Seller Rating

By integrating the Trusted Shops Seller Rating, customers can give reviews that are independent of your store. Independent reviews make your store more trustworthy.  +
Once you have **link:https://www.trustedshops.eu/merchants/[registered]** with Trusted Shops and had your store certified, read this page to learn how to set up seller ratings in plentymarkets.

== Setting up the Trusted Shops Seller Rating

Set up seller ratings in plentymarkets by **__activating__** the seller ratings and then integrating them into your online store. Go to **<<omni-channel/online-store/extras/trusted-shops#, System » Client » Select client » Services>>** to activate the function.

=== Integrating the Trusted Shops Seller Rating

Once you have **<<omni-channel/online-store/extras/trusted-shops#, activated the seller ratings>>**, integrate them into your online store. Use **<<omni-channel/online-store/cms-syntax#basics-template-variables, template variables>>** in the **CMS** menu to do so. The Trusted Shops variables are listed under the **__global variables__** in the **PageDesignTemplateVars** folder. They are also listed on the **<<omni-channel/online-store/cms-syntax#web-design-pagedesign, PageDesign>>** page of the manual.

==== Template variables

If a **Trusted Shops ID** is activated, then you can integrate the **template variables** (widget and "write a review!" buttons) into your online store - according to the language of the design.

[TIP]
.Tip: Using the integration handbook
====
Refer to the Trusted Shops Seller Rating integration handbook when integrating the template variables. The **$TrustedShopsRatingEmailButton** variable is the "write a review!" button for system e-mails and the order confirmation page. The button is included in the plentymarkets layout by default and is displayed in the order overview. You can integrate the Trusted Shops variables into any design. The customer's **e-mail address** and the **order ID** will automatically be transferred over to the review form.
====

[WARNING]
.Make note of the language
====
If the seller rating is not activated for the corresponding design language or if the language was not booked with Trusted Shops, then the template variables will not be displayed or they will be empty.

==== Trusted Rating widget for the online store: $TrustedShopsRating

[TIP]
.Tip
====
You can configure the widget's **height**, **width**, **comments** and **branding** in the **link:https://www.trustedshops.com/en/shop/login.html[Trusted Shops System^]**.
====

[WARNING]
.Seller ratings
====
The seller ratings are not displayed in real time. The widget graphic is reloaded once a day (at night). The widget, as shown in image 1, will only be displayed after 60 seller ratings have been received. Before this point, the **$TrustedShopsRatingShopButton** template variable will be replaced by a "write a review!" button (image 2).

==== Write a review! button for system e-mails and the order confirmation page:  +

Use the variable **$TrustedShopsRatingEmailButton** in the store's CMS and in e-mail templates. For example, it makes sense to use the variable in a reminder e-mail that you send to your customers and ask them to rate your store. We describe how to automate this reminder below.

[.instruction]
Configuring a seller rating reminder:

. Go to **<<basics/automation/procedure-manager#, System » Orders » Procedures>>**.
. Click on the **New procedure** tab.
. Click on the **Procedure** tab within the new procedure.
. Use the **Send e-mail template** option to select an e-mail template from the drop-down menu. The template should invite customers to rate your store and should contain the corresponding template variable.  +
→ Create the **<<crm/sending-emails#1200, e-mail template>>** under **System » Client » Select client » Email » Templates**.
. Click on the **Filter** tab.
. Select a **status**, e.g. **Outgoing items booked**.
. Select an option for the **last status change**, e.g. 14 days ago.
. Click on the **Settings** tab.
. Place a check mark next to the option **Active** to activate the procedure.
. Click on the **save icon** to save the settings.

In this example, your customers would be sent an e-mail 14 days after their items were shipped. The e-mail would ask customers to submit a seller rating with Trusted Shops.

[WARNING]
.Pay attention to the market's terms and conditions
====
Understand the particular market's terms and conditions before you set up a function in your online store that requests a seller rating. Some markets only allow you to request seller ratings if specific requirements are met. Some markets do not permit this at all. Exclude markets by not selecting them with the **Order referrer** option in the **Filter** tab.
====

[IMPORTANT]
.Plain text link in plain text e-mails
====
If the template variable is integrated into an e-mail template that is configured as being **plain text only**, then the e-mail will only contain the link as plain text. It will not contain an additional graphic. In this case, be sure to tell customers what this link is for, e.g. **Rate our store! ($TrustedShopsRatingEmailButton)**.
====

[TIP]
.Buttons in e-mails
====
Some e-mail programs, e.g. Mozilla Thunderbird, don't display graphics directly in e-mails. If you see text displayed instead of a graphic, despite the fact that you defined the e-mail as having **only text in HTML format**, then check whether the e-mail program may have incorrectly downloaded the graphics. The link to the ratings should still work when clicking on the alternative text.
====

=== Setting up Rich Snippets for Google

Rich Snippets help display detailed information in search engines. Edit your store's CMS in order to display your store's Trusted Shops Seller Rating in Google search results.

Open the **CMS** menu and insert the following code in the **PageDesignContentMainFrame** template.
