== Facebook

**Facebook** is a social networking website with more than 845 million active users. In 2009, a study ranked Facebook as the **most used social networking service** by worldwide monthly active users (Wikipedia). Facebook also allows developers to make their own websites more social with the help of "Facebook Connect". One of the most commonly used features for doing so is the comment function (http://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/198/). For example, users can configure their own Facebook app (e.g. for the online store) and then use this menu to connect the app with plentymarkets.
