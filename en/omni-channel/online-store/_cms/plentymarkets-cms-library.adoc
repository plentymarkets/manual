The link:https://github.com/plentymarkets/plenty-cms-library[**plentymarkets CMS library**, window="_blank"] is an open source project developed by plentymarkets. The project moves the logical JavaScript elements of the plentymarkets CMS to GitHub repository files. As such, it facilitates a clearer separation of layout and logic. The project's main goals were increased modularisation, testability, internationalisation and independence of JavaScript frameworks. +
You can find the project files on link:https://github.com/plentymarkets/plenty-cms-library[**GitHub.com**, window="_blank"]. You can download the files for free and contribute at any time.
