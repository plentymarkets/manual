*CMS » Web design » Layout » CSS*

== General information

These chapters provide you with basic information about *CSS*. You will learn what CSS means and how to use CSS to design your online store. Furthermore, you will learn how CSS is structured in plentymarkets and where the specifications are saved for the different areas.

*CSS* (**C**ascading **S**tyle **S**heets) denotes a markup language for structured documents. While *HTML* lets you create the pure content, CSS offers you more possibilities to influence the format and structure of this content, as well as to influence the design of a website.

== CSS in plentymarkets

General CSS specifications are saved in plentymarkets within *CSSBase*. These general specifications apply to every area of the CSS. The menu items below *CSSBase* only contain exceptions or additions to the specifications saved in *CSSBase*. You can save CSS rules for each area of the online store, e.g. for the *order process* or the *My account* area. You can also use template functions to include other areas in the CSS (section 4). The particular combination generates one CSS file for each area, i.e. there is *only one URL per area*.

== Areas in the CMS

Go to *CMS » Web design » Layout » CSS* to find the CSS formatting. The CSS is saved in several different menu items, which are described below.

[TIP]
.Unused
====
The *Unused* folder contains CSS areas that were not configured or that were left blank for a different reason. If the CSS is completely deleted from a menu item, then it will be moved into this folder.

=== CSSBase

The CSSBase contains the general CSS specifications for the entire online store. These specifications are always loaded.

=== CSSContent

CSS formatting for *categories* with the template *PageDesignContent* as well as for the *item layouts* and the *item search* in the online store.

=== CSSOrder

CSS formatting for the *order process*.

=== CSSMyAccount

CSS formatting for the *My account* area.

=== CSSForum

CSS formatting for the *forum*.

=== CSSBlog

CSS formatting for the *blog*.

== Application

Use the *CSS()* template function to insert the CSS into a page design. By default, both the *CSSBase* and the CSS for the particular area are loaded into one CSS file. Use the following function to add further areas to the CSS file:

[source,plenty]
----
{% CSS([Content, Forum]) %}
----

In this example, the *Content* area is expanded to also include the CSS specifications for the *Forum*. The specifications that were saved for both areas will be used. The CSS area that should be expanded needs to be listed in such a template function. In this example, this is the *CSSContent* area. The obligatory *CSSBase* area does not need to be included in the code since it is always loaded automatically.
