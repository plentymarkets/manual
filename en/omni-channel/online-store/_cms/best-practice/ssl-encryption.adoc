==  The benefits of SSL encryption

If having a __**secure connection**__ is important to you, then you will surely be interested in using __**<<basics/working-with-plentymarkets/plentymarkets-account#ssl-certificate, SSL  >> encryption**__ for your website. Pay attention to the following information and carry out the steps completely. Make sure that your entire website is correctly encrypted to avoid causing confusion among visitors to your website or online store.

This page teaches you how to correctly save content such as __**images**__, __**CSS files**__ or __**JavaScript files**__ in your design.

[IMPORTANT]
.Preparing the design for SSL
====
We recommend that you prepare your design for SSL, even if you have not ordered an SSL certificate yet or you have not started working with SSL.
====

==  Configuration

The following examples show you what to pay attention to when configuring the content of your online store and contain useful tips.

===  Images

Insert __**images**__ into the design with __**relative URLs**__. Avoid using absolute URLs.

[TIP]
.Example images
====
__**Not recommended**__: +
&lt;img src="**https://www.meinshop.de/images/gallery/Bild_01.png**" /&gt;

__**Recommended**__: +
&lt;img src="**/images/gallery/Bild_01.png**" /&gt;
====

===  CSS files

The same applies to inserting __**CSS files**__. __**Relative URLs**__ should also be used here.

[TIP]
.Example CSS file
====
__**Not recommended**__: +
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="**https://www.meinshop.de/layout/style.css**" /&gt;

__**Recommended**__: +
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="**/layout/style.css**" /&gt;
====

If you need to insert __**external CSS files**__, then leave out __**http**__ or __**https**__. This will allow the browser to decide how the content should be loaded. The following example relates to the service link:https://www.google.com/fonts[**Google Fonts**, window="_blank"].

[TIP]
.Example external CSS file
====
__**Not recommended**__: +
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="**https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Tangerine**" /&gt;

__**Recommended**__: +
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="**//fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Tangerine**" /&gt;
====

==  Redirect

In order to switch to SSL encryption, it must be possible for all old HTTP URLs to __**redirect**__ to the new HTTPS equivalents via 301 redirect. It also has to be possible to consistently switch the __**canonical targets**__, __**internal links**__ and __**sitemap**__ to the new protocol. This means that customers who access an old URL - __**http**__://your-store.com/ - will automatically be forwarded to the new URL - __**https**__://your-store.com.

The **link::/[sitemap] file** of current plentymarkets online stores only contains the new **HTTPS** URLs. If your website works with absolute wildcard character links, then they will also be converted from __**http://**__ to **__https://__**.

[WARNING]
.Deleting the sitemap content
====
You need to delete your system's sitemap file after installing the <<basics/working-with-plentymarkets/plentymarkets-account#ssl-certificate, **SSL certificate**  >>. This ensures that the sitemap file will be updated with the new encrypted URLs. The sitemap is updated daily in plentymarkets. This process takes place at night.
====

[IMPORTANT]
.New indexing by search engines
====
Search engines need a bit of time to match the relevance of old URLs to the new URLs. How quickly this process is completed depends on the previous relevance of your website.
====

==  Deactivating the redirect

If you do not want to redirect to SSL, then you can deactivate this function in the service center. If you use this function, then customers who access an http URL __**will not automatically be redirected**__ to an https URL. The internal links and the sitemap will still only contain https URLs to avoid jeopardizing the new changes.

Talk to your SEO agency and decide whether to use the automatic SSL redirect.

[.instruction]
Deactivating the SSL redirect:

.  Go to **Start » plentymarkets account » Service center**.
.  Select the desired __**plentymarkets system**__.
.  Click on the **Cache** tab.
.  Scroll down to the section **Permanent SSL redirect**.
.  Select the option **always inactive**.
.  Click on the **Save permanent SSL redirect** button.

[IMPORTANT]
.The &lt; IE 9 inactive option
====
This option relates to systems that run with __**Windows XP**__ and __**Internet Explorer**__ version 9 or lower. This option deactivates the permanent SSL redirect for these systems only.
====

The change will go into effect the next time the webserver is updated. Webserver settings are currently updated four times per day.

==  Saving the correct URL

Pay attention to the notes about SSL encryption that relate to other areas such as **link::/[Google Analytics]** or link::/[**Google Webmaster Tools**].
