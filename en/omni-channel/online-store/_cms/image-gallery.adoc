**plentymarkets » CMS » Image gallery**

== General information

Use the image gallery to upload images that should be displayed in your online store. These can be saved there in folders. In order to manage your images in a structured way, you can create as many folders as you would like along with the **initial** (default) folder.

An image has to be available as an Internet resource before it can be displayed in the store's layout, e.g. as a logo. Additionally, the corresponding image has to be uploaded via **<<basics/data-exchange/ftp-access#, FTP>>** or it has to be uploaded into the **image gallery**.

== Managing images

The following section explains how you can upload, edit or delete images in the image gallery.

== Managing folders

Proceed as follows to create new folders and manage existing ones. Select the names and the structure of your folders carefully. This will help you keep track of your images, even if there are a lot of them.

[.instruction]
Creating a new folder:

. Go to **CMS » Image gallery**.
. Click on the **New folder** button in the lower left corner. +
→ A new window will open.
. If you want the new folder to be a __**subfolder**__ that is located within an existing folder, then select the existing folder. If you want to create a new __**main folder**__, then simply enter the name of the new folder without clicking on any of the existing folders.
. Enter a **name** for the new folder into the text field and then click on **OK** to create the folder. +
→ After you have created the new folder, it will immediately become available in the overview of folders. If the folder was not sorted correctly, then update the image gallery (reload the page).

[.instruction]
Synchronizing folders:

. Go to **CMS » Image gallery**.
. Select the folder in question from the folder overview.
. Click on the **synchronize folders** button and update the image gallery afterwards (**reload**).

This option serves to __**synchronize**__ the images that were loaded into already existing folders via **<<basics/data-exchange/ftp-access#, FTP>>**. In order for these folders to be available in your image gallery, you have to carry out the following function. Furthermore, synchronization is necessary if the images are not correctly displayed, i.e. if they are shown without a preview image. If there are several images in the folder, then you may have to carry out this process __**multiple**__ times in order to synchronize all of the images.

[.instruction]
Deleting a folder:

. Use your mouse to __**right-click**__ on the desired folder.
. Click on the **delete icon** to delete the folder.
