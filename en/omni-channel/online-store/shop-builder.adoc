== Scripts in the text widget

In order to use JavaScript scripts in the online store, you can implement *<script2>* tags in the text widget of the ShopBuilder. This tag functions like a common <script> tag. ¤For the documentation of the framework used for the ShopBuilder, see link:https://github.com/taoeffect/vue-script2[here^].

[source,plenty]
----
<script2 src="https://momentjs.com/downloads/moment.js"></script2>

----

*Explanation*: Here a <script2> tag is used only with the src attribute to load an external script.

[source,plenty]
----
<script2>
    var today = moment().format('dddd');
    alert("today is " + today);
</script2>

----

*Explanation*: JavaScript code is written within the script2 tag. moment.js is accessed here, which was loaded in the previous script.

*Tip*: External scripts can be uploaded in the webspace and integrated via the ShopBuilder. You can access the URL of the script in the plentymarkets webspace.
