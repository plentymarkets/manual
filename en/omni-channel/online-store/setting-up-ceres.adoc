link:https://marketplace.plentymarkets.com/plugins/templates/Ceres_4697[Ceres^] is the official template plugin for the default online store of plentymarkets 7. In the new online store for plentymarkets 7, design and logic are separated from each other. Two plugins are required to integrate the online store into your plentymarkets system. The Ceres plugin contains the new standard design of the online store and can be customised to meet your needs. The link:https://marketplace.plentymarkets.com/plugins/templates/IO_4696[IO^] plugin contains the logic part of the online store, is a general basis for all design plugins and can also be used by other plugins. On this page of the manual you learn how to <<#10, set up Ceres>> and how to <<#1000, customise Ceres>>.

[#10]
== Setting up Ceres in plentymarkets

You can make changes to your design by carrying out the design settings. No programming experience is required. To carry out the design settings, proceed as follows.

[WARNING]
.Old online store will be unavailable
====
When deploying the online store plugins *Ceres* and *IO* <<basics/first-steps/plugins#50, in Productive>>, the old plentymarkets online store will be unavailable. *Ceres* will use the URL of the online store.
====

[TIP]
.Plugin position numbers
====
Installed plugins are loaded according to their position. The plugin with the lowest position number is located at the top of the list and will be loaded first. The plugin with the highest position number is located at the bottom of the list and will be loaded last. The plugin position is particularly important for the online store plugin *IO*, which has to be assigned the highest plugin position (e.g. 999) so that all routes of the online store are working properly.
====

[.instruction]
Saving the position number:

. Go to *Plugins » Plugin overview*.
. Click on *Switch to table view* in the toolbar. +
→ The plugins will be displayed in the table view.
. Click on *Set position* in the line of the *IO* plugin. +
→ The *Plugin position* window will open.
. Enter a new position number, e.g. *999*.
. *Save* the settings. +
→ The *IO* plugin will be reordered in the list of plugins.

Repeat steps 2 to 4 for the *Ceres* plugin. Save a position number for *Ceres*, e.g. *998*.
