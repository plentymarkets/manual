==  General information about forms

Create and edit forms in this menu. One example of a form is the contact form displayed in your online store. In this area, store visitors can enter their contact information along with a question or comment. After the visitor clicks on the submit button, the entries will be sent to the e-mail address that was saved in the **Settings » Client (store) » Standard » E-mail » Access data** menu. The template variable **{% Form(X) %}** is used to insert a form into your online store.

==  Creating a form

You can create a new form directly after opening up the menu. If you have clicked on one of the existing forms listed under the heading **FORMS** in the upper left corner, then you will not be able to create a new form until you have reloaded the menu. By reloading the menu, you change the screen back to its original appearance.

| Setting | Explanation

|**ID**
| The form ID is assigned by the system and can not be changed. The ID is used to insert a form into the online store.

|**Form name**
| Enter a name for the form.

|**E-mail subject**
| Enter an E-mail subject. The text will be displayed in the subject line of all e-mails that are sent with the form. If you work with several different forms, then the subject can help you to recognize which form this E-mail refers to. +
__**Important:**__ If you want the form to be imported into the ticket system, then you are required to enter a subject. If there is no subject, then the customer's E-mail address will not be saved. This means that E-mails may be sent to your own address with an event procedure.

|**CC E-mail address**
| Enter an E-mail address. The entries made in the form will also be sent to this address (=CC).

|**Ticket type**
| Select a type if you want to import the form into the system as a ticket.

|**Ticket status**
| Select a status if you want to import the form into the system as a ticket.

|**Field name**
| Enter the field names for the form, e.g. Company, Last name, First name, E-mail etc.

|**Type**
| Select the **data type** for the data field. On the one hand, the type determines how the entry field will be displayed in the form, e.g. as a **single-line entry field**, as a **multi-line text field** or as a **check box**. On the other hand, the system uses the type to recognize which information is entered by the customer, e.g. an E-mail address, first name, last name or telephone number. This is important so that the information is assigned to the correct data field.

|**Width (pixels)**
| Enter the width of the data field (in pixels).

|**Mandatory field**
| Select the setting **YES** to indicate that a data field is mandatory. Mandatory fields will be displayed on the form in bold font.

==  Inserting a form in a category

Forms are inserted into a category in two steps. First, determine the ID of the desired form. Second, insert the correct wildcard character and code into the category. To do so, proceed as follows.

===  Determining the form's ID

The template variable **{% Form(X) %}** is used to insert a form into a category. Replace the X with the form's ID.

.  Go to **Settings » CMS » Forms**.
.  Select the form that you want to change from the overview of **FORMS**.

===  Inserting the template variable and code

You can use an IF/ELSE query to respond to a form being submitted, e.g. by displaying the words __**Thank you for your message**__. The following is an example code, which contains this message:
