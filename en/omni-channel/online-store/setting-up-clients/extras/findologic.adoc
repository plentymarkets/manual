== FINDOLOGIC - search and sales control

The intelligent search technology FINDOLOGIC helps your customers find the items they are looking for. At the same time, it provides customers with a unique shopping experience and contributes to their satisfaction with your online store.

=== Search quality

The search function helps users find the items they are really looking for. Thanks to intelligent technology, you no longer have to alter settings or boosts to achieve this goal. This means that improving for the worse by manually changing things is not possible. +
In addition, the FINDOLOGIC search function is continuously enhanced as it learns from users' behavior. As a result, relevant items are automatically ranked higher. FINDOLOGIC learns to understand the terms users enter and creates its own vocabulary based on them.

== Integrating the search software FINDOLOGIC into plentymarkets

In order to use the FINDOLOGIC search in your online store, you have to order it with FINDOLOGIC's online order form: +

== The search result's design

The following options are available for the search results' design.

=== "FINDOLOGIC" option

With this setting, the design of search results in the FINDOLOGIC template manager will be adjusted. The template is called *plenty.tpl*.

Specific characteristics are missing from the FINDOLOGIC design. These are, in contrast, provided by the plentymarkets design, e.g. *availability* (see section 2.3).

=== "Plenty" option

With the *Plenty* setting, the search results will be generated by the plentymarkets system.

[TIP]

Select the *Plenty* option for the search result's design instead of the FINDOLOGIC option. If you do not do this, then only the item IDs will be displayed in the search instead of the entire item itself +
Make sure to include the *slash "/"* at the end. Otherwise the search will not be correctly integrated into your store.
====

Go to *CMS » Web design » Layout » ItemView » ItemViewSearchResultsList* to carry out the corresponding settings (<<image-code-search-result>>).
