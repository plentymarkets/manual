== Preparing econda Shop Monitor

If you have successfully registered with econda, then you will have received a JavaScript class (file name: "emos2.js" or similar). econda personalized this for you so that you don't need any additional access data in order to activate the econda Shop Monitor in plentymarkets. It is necessary to upload this JavaScript class before you can activate econda Shop Monitor Tracking. +
The following process needs to be repeated for each client (store). The same JavaScript class can be used for every client (store). If you would like to separate the clients (stores) for tracking purposes, then pay attention to section 4.1 *Assignment*.

The following table explains the settings in the *Assignment* area:

[cols="1,3"]
|====
|Setting |Explanation

|*Use site IDs*
|If the check mark has been placed, then a *site ID* will be attached to the data that is transferred to econda. By using this *site ID*, the econda Shop Monitor can tell how the data should be assigned. The client (store) ID is the default value for this ID (0 = main store; 1,2,3 ... = client 1,2,3 ...)

|*User-defined site ID*
|If the check mark has been placed and a *user-defined site ID* has been created, then this *user-defined site ID* will be transferred instead of the default store ID. Don't forget to place a check mark next to *use site IDs* anyway. +
*Tip:* If you would like several clients (stores) to be analyzed in the same round of tracking, then activate the *user-defined site ID* for the respective clients (place a check mark).
|====

=== Free transfer parameters

econda offers three parameters for transferring the tracking data, which you can configure as you would like. Assign values to the parameters *#1*, *#2* and *#3*, which refer to additional information about the items.

image::omni-channel/online-store/setting-up-clients/extras/assets/EN-Settings-Client-Conversion-econda-05.png[]

[.instruction]
Configuring free transfer parameters:

. Use the drop-down lists to select which attributes you want to use for *variations #1 - #3*. +
→ You will only be able to select attributes here if you have already created attributes under <<item/managing-items#390, System » Item » Attributes>>.
. Assign the desired item data to the transfer parameters *#1*, *#2* and *#3*.
. *Save* the settings.

[TIP]

Set JavaScript as the *forwarding method* for *PayPal Express* <<omni-channel/online-store/setting-up-clients/cms#web-design-editing-the-web-design-order-process-order-confirmation, order confirmations>> to ensure correct tracking.

==== Tracking the FINDOLOGIC search

Do you use the <<omni-channel/online-store/setting-up-clients/extras/findologic#, FINDOLOGIC>> search? Then information about the search term and the number of results will no longer be transferred automatically to econda. In order to change that, you have to add a specific tag to the FINDOLOGIC search results template, which will provide plentymarkets with the necessary information.

==== Your FINDOLOGIC account's template manager

Take a look at the template for the search responses. Enter the tag *&lt;PLENTY_TOTAL_RESULTS&gt;{$TOTAL_RESULTS}&lt;/PLENTY_TOTAL_RESULTS&gt;*. This method also works if you have activated the option *plenty* as the *search results design*.

=== Activating cross-selling

You can also use econda's cross-selling function with plentymarkets. Here, econda analyzes your items and creates cross-selling lists that can be processed by plentymarkets. Proceed as follows to activate econda's cross-selling function.
