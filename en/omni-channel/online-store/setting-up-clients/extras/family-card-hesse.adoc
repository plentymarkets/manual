==  General information

The family card Hesse was introduced by the government of Hesse in collaboration with partners from the field of economics and other institutions. It is an additional building block towards creating a modern family policy, which deals with the needs of families. In the form of a check card, families in Hesse have been able to use this card since September 11th, 2010 in order to receive a variety of discounts and support in several areas. Further information (in German) can be found here: link:http://www.familienkarte.hessen.de/dynasite.cfm?dsmid=14502[www.familienkarte.hessen.de^].
