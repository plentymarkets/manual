== General information about item sorting

Use the item sorting to define how items should be sorted in the online store, i.e. in which order items will be displayed there. In addition, you select the criteria for item sorting that you would like to take effect for the item search. This function relates to the live search for items in the online store.

== Design settings

The *... _DefaultItemSorting* setting is available in the *Settings* tab of several of the templates in the *CMS » Web design » Folder: Layout » Folder: ItemView* menu. These templates are listed in section 2.2.

=== Configuring the item sorting

The item sorting is configured using the *... _DefaultItemSorting* setting of the ItemView templates listed in section 2.2. You can change default settings in the drop-down list. <<image-cms-settings-item-sorting>> shows an example of the item layout *ItemViewTopSellersList*.

You can specify how the items should be sorted in every individual template. For example, if you have a very large catalog of items and you want your customers to quickly find the item that they are looking for, then it would be wise to sort the items by item name. If price is the most important factor, then sort the items in ascending or descending order by price.

The following table explains the available settings for *... _DefaultItemSorting*:

* ItemViewSearchResultsList
* ItemViewCategoriesList
* ItemViewCrossSellingItemsList

=== Setting up cross-selling templates

With the cross-selling function, you have the possibility of offering additional items from your product range along with an item in your online store. The additional items should be necessary extensions or reasonable supplements for your customer's current selection.
If such connections also exist for your items, then you can use the **cross-selling** option to set up associations between them and benefit from additional sales. A variation of this is dynamic cross-selling. With this variation, connections between items will automatically be created based on the items that customers purchase together.

In the <<omni-channel/online-store/setting-up-clients/online-store, Basic settings for your online store>>, you set up cross-selling. On the one hand, you select which type of cross-selling you want to use. On the other hand, you select whether or not to use dynamic cross-selling.

[.instruction]
Setting up cross-selling:

. Go to **System » Client » Select client » Online store » Basic settings**.
. Carry out the cross-selling settings as described in the <<tabelle-cross-selling-basic-settings>> table.
. **Save** the settings.

For further information about setting up cross-selling relations between your items, refer to the <<item/managing-items#950, Setting up cross-selling>> page.
Once you have specified which cross-selling items should be offered, decide how the cross-selling items should be displayed in the online store. Use the templates <<omni-channel/online-store/setting-up-clients/cms-syntax#web-design-itemview-container-itemviewcrosssellingitemslist, ItemViewCrossSellingItemsList>>, <<omni-channel/online-store/setting-up-clients/cms-syntax#web-design-itemview-container-itemviewcrosssellingitemslist2, ItemViewCrossSellingItemsList2>> and <<omni-channel/online-store/setting-up-clients/cms-syntax#web-design-itemview-container-itemviewcrosssellingitemslist3, ItemViewCrossSellingItemsList3>> to specify how cross-selling items are displayed. For example, you can specify how many cross-selling items should be displayed for an item and how many of them should be displayed next to each other. Finally, specify where and which cross-selling items should be displayed for a main item. For this, insert a container in one of the templates for single items, e.g. <<omni-channel/online-store/setting-up-clients/cms-syntax#web-design-itemview-container-itemviewsingleitem, ItemViewSingleItem>>.

[.instruction]
Setting up a cross-selling template:

. Go to **CMS » Web design » Folder: Layout » Folder: ItemView**.
. Open the **ItemViewCrossSellingItemsList** template.
. Click on the **Settings** tab.
. Enter the maximum number of cross-selling items that should be displayed per main item. Enter this number next to the option **ItemViewCrossSellingItemsList_Limit**. +
→ For example, enter **5** if you want a maximum of five cross-selling items to be displayed for an item.
. In the line **ItemViewCrossSellingItemsList_EachRow**, enter a limit that determines how many cross-selling items are permitted per line (default layout: **1** or **2**).
. **Save** the settings.

===== Setting up dynamic cross-selling

In dynamic cross-selling, if items are purchased together, these additional items will be linked as cross-selling items with the main item automatically. These links will be visible in the online store the next day. Sales will be taken into account after activating this function. 10 dynamic cross-selling links are possible for each item. If there are more than 10 links, only the 10 best selling items will be displayed. You can manually delete the cross-selling links that were automatically generated. This is done in the item's **Cross-selling** tab.

[.instruction]
Setting up dynamic cross-selling:

. Go to **System » Client » Select client » Online store » Basic settings**.
. Select **Use direct cross-selling** for the **Cross-selling** option.
. Select the option **Yes** for **Dynamic cross-selling**.
. **Save** the settings.

===== Displaying cross-selling items on an item's page

The layout for cross-selling items is designed in the templates **ItemViewCrossSellingItemsList** to **ItemViewCrossSellingItemsList3**. The templates **ItemViewCrossSellingItemsList** and **ItemViewCrossSellingItemsList2** are ready to use in the plentymarkets default design Callisto Light. These cross-selling templates are displayed using the containers <<omni-channel/online-store/setting-up-clients/cms-syntax#web-design-itemview-container-itemviewcrosssellingitemslist, Container_ItemViewCrossSellingItemsList>> or <<omni-channel/online-store/setting-up-clients/cms-syntax#web-design-itemview-container-itemviewcrosssellingitemslist, Container_ItemViewCrossSellingItemsList2>>. In Callisto Light, these containers are already integrated within the template for single items <<omni-channel/online-store/setting-up-clients/cms-syntax#web-design-itemview-container-itemviewsingleitem, ItemViewSingleItem>> and used as follows:

* <<omni-channel/online-store/setting-up-clients/cms-syntax#web-design-itemview-container-itemviewcrosssellingitemslist, Container_ItemViewCrossSellingItemsList>> lists similar items {%$CrossSellingType = "Similar" %}.
* <<omni-channel/online-store/setting-up-clients/cms-syntax#web-design-itemview-container-itemviewcrosssellingitemslist, Container_ItemViewCrossSellingItemsList2>> lists accessories {%$CrossSellingType = "Accessory" %}.

To display cross-selling items with a different relation, adjust the **template variable**.

* **Accessory** = {%$CrossSellingType = "Accessory" %}
* **Replacement part** = {%$CrossSellingType = "ReplacementPart" %}
* **Similar item** = {%$CrossSellingType = "Similar" %}
* **Item bundle** = {%$CrossSellingType = "Bundle" %}
