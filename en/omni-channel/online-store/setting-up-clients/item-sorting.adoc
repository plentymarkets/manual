== General information about item sorting

Use the item sorting to define how items should be sorted in the online store, i.e. in which order items will be displayed there. In addition, you select the criteria for item sorting that you would like to take effect for the item search. This function relates to the live search for items in the online store.

== Design settings

The *... _DefaultItemSorting* setting is available in the *Settings* tab of several of the templates in the *CMS » Web design » Folder: Layout » Folder: ItemView* menu. These templates are listed in section 2.2.

=== Configuring the item sorting

The item sorting is configured using the *... _DefaultItemSorting* setting of the ItemView templates listed in section 2.2. You can change default settings in the drop-down menu. <<image-cms-settings-item-sorting>> shows an example of the item layout *ItemViewTopSellersList*.

You can specify how the items should be sorted in every individual template. For example, if you have a very large catalog of items and you want your customers to quickly find the item that they are looking for, then it would be wise to sort the items by item name. If price is the most important factor, then sort the items in ascending or descending order by price.

The following table explains the available settings for *... _DefaultItemSorting*:

.CMS settings; item sorting
