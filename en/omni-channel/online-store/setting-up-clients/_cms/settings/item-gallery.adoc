The *System » CMS » Item gallery* menu allows you to create item galleries. Item galleries are used to present items in a gallery view in your online store. Your customers will then see specific items, e.g. your latest or top items. They can open an item by clicking on it. Item images are slightly enlarged when customers point their cursor at it. If more than one item image exists for an item, the image with the highest priority is displayed.
