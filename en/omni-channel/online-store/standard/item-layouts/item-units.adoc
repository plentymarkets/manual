==  Item units

In this menu, you can select whether or not you want to use decimal places for each of the individual **item units**. You can assign an item unit to each one of your items. This is done in the <<item/managing-items#270, **Settings** >> tab of a variation.

==  Settings

The most logical setting is selected by default for every item unit. For example, it is not common to use decimal places when working with **milligrams**, but it is common for **kilograms**.
