Sellers who ship items from Germany to other EU countries are required by German law to provide the tax authorities with proof that the items actually traveled from Germany to another EU member state. German authorities introduced the so-called entry certificate (Gelangensbestätigung) for this reason. Foreign buyers are required to confirm that they received the items.

The document **Entry certificate (Gelangensbestätigung)** can be configured separately for each language. This document is edited in the menu **Settings » Client (store) » Select store » Locations » Select location » Documents » Entry certificate (Gelangensbestätigung**.

==  Entry certificate information

VAT is omitted when a German seller ships items to a customer who is in a different European country and has a valid VAT number. The order is issued as net. However, if the customer's delivery address is also in Germany, then VAT will be calculated for the order. German law permits orders to be issued as net for customers from other European countries who have a valid VAT number and provide a German delivery address. In this case, an entry certificate needs to be included with the order. The **<<omni-channel/online-store/standard/documents/entry-certificate#10, Delivery addresses >>** menu includes the option **Entry certificate** for this reason. If a check mark is placed next to the **Entry certificate** option, then orders that are placed by customers in other European countries but shipped to a German delivery address will be treated like shipments to foreign EU countries. The settings **VAT number** and **Export shipping** in the <<omni-channel/online-store/standard/accounting#, **Accounting**  >> menu then determine whether the invoice is issued as gross or net. If no check mark is placed next to the **Entry certificate** option, then these orders will be issued as gross.

The template settings range from mandatory elements to optional elements such as a payment due date or payment discount options. Some of the information that appears on templates is saved directly in the template settings. Other information is automatically inserted into the template, e.g. customer data. Refer to the link:http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/ustdv_1980/__17a.html[**German Value Added Tax Ordinance**, window="_blank"] for information about which specific details need to be included on the entry certificate. Alternatively, get in contact with your tax consultant.

==  Configuring an entry certificate

This chapter teaches you how to set up the template, how to apply settings from one template to another, how to save a PDF template and how to set up a numbering system.

===  Applying default settings

The **Transfer** tab allows you to apply default settings to your template, i.e. to reset your template to its default values. The tab also allows you to apply your template's settings to another template, e.g. to the delivery note. For example, you may want to give your template the default settings if it does not yet contain any settings or you can use the default settings to reset your template. For further information, refer to the **Documents** page of the manual. Specifically, refer to the <<order-processing/orders/settings/documents#140, **Copying settings** >> chapter.

===  Setting up a template

You have to set up a template before you can print entry certificates. For further information about the configuration, refer to the **Documents** page of the manual. Specifically, refer to the <<order-processing/orders/settings/documents#40, **Configuring document templates** >> chapter.

[IMPORTANT]
.Positioning with coordinates
====
Use **x** and **y coordinates** to position the content within the template. The starting point is the upper left corner of the page.
====

===  Applying settings

The **Transfer** tab allows you to copy the settings in the entry certificate's **Template** tab and then apply these settings to a different document, e.g. to a delivery note. For further information, refer to the **Documents** page of the manual. Specifically, refer to the <<order-processing/orders/settings/documents#140, **Applying settings** >> chapter.

===  Saving PDF templates

Once you have set up the invoice template you can upload a PDF file e.g. with your company logo in the **PDF template** tab. The PDF file has to be on your computer first. For further information, refer to the **Documents** page of the manual. Specifically, refer to the <<order-processing/orders/settings/documents#170, **PDF template** >> chapter.

===  Creating a numbering system

Use the template's **Numbering** tab to specify how the documents should be numbered. For further information, refer to the **Documents** page of the manual. Specifically, refer to the <<order-processing/orders/settings/documents#200, **Numbering** >> chapter.
