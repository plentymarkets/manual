The invoice includes important information about the items included in an order, the recipient's address and the amount due. plentymarkets includes pre-configured templates, which you can edit as desired. The document **Invoice** can be configured separately for each language. This document is edited in the menu **Settings » Client (store) » Select store » Locations » Select location » Documents » Invoice**.

==  Invoice information

The template settings range from mandatory elements to optional elements such as a payment due date or payment discount options. Some of the information that appears on templates is saved directly in the template settings. Other information is automatically inserted into the template, e.g. customer data.

[IMPORTANT]
.Displaying the bank details for debit
====
If you use the payment method **debit**, then information about the debit procedure and the customer's bank data (IBAN and BIC) are automatically written on the document. The IBAN is not completely displayed for security reasons. Only the first 12 characters and the last 3 characters are displayed. The remaining characters are replaced with "xxx". +
If no bank information is saved for the customer, then the **IBAN** and **BIC** will not be displayed on the invoice. +
The text about the debit procedure can not be changed.

==  Configuring invoices

This chapter teaches you how to configure the document. You will learn how to set up the template within the **Documents** menu, how to apply settings from one template to another, how to save a PDF template and how to set up a numbering system.

===  Applying default settings

The **Transfer** tab allows you to apply default settings to your template. For example, you may want to give your template the default settings if it does not yet contain any settings or you can use the default settings to reset your template. For further information, refer to the **Documents** page of the manual. Specifically, refer to the <<order-processing/orders/settings/documents#140, **Applying settings** >> chapter.

===  Setting up a template

You need to set up a template first before you can create invoices. For further information, refer to the **Documents** page of the manual. Specifically, refer to the <<order-processing/orders/settings/documents#40, **Configuring a document template** >> chapter.

[IMPORTANT]

====

===  Applying settings

The **Transfer** tab allows you to copy the settings in the invoice's **Template** tab and then apply these settings to a different document, e.g. to a delivery note. For further information, refer to the **Documents** page of the manual. Specifically, refer to the <<order-processing/orders/settings/documents#140, **Applying settings** >> chapter.

===  Saving PDF templates

Once you have set up the invoice template you can upload a PDF file e.g. with your company logo in the **PDF template** tab. The PDF file has to be on your computer first. For further information, refer to the **Documents** page of the manual. Specifically, refer to the <<order-processing/orders/settings/documents#170, **PDF template** >> chapter.

===  Creating a numbering system

Use the template's **Numbering** tab to specify how the documents should be numbered. For further information, refer to the **Documents** page of the manual. Specifically, refer to the <<order-processing/orders/settings/documents#200, **Numbering** >> chapter.
