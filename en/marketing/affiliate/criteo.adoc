|====
| Entry/Setting | Explanation

|**Partner ID**
| Enter the **partner ID** that you received from Criteo.

|**Order referrer**
| Select an **order referrer** or leave the setting as **no selection**.

|
| You can create a separate **order referrer** for Criteo by going to **Settings &gt; Orders &gt; Order referrer**. This order referrer can then be selected here (see image 1). +
If you would like to have a different **price** apply to this order referrer, then you can assign it a separate **price column** with an individual price.

|**Client (store) export**
| Use the drop-down menu to select the **store**, which has **item URLs** that you want to use for the **export**. Alternatively, select the setting **All** if you want all of the URLs to be exported.

|
| Please note that you can also assign the store by using the **Item export URL** option further below.

|**Client (store) tracking**
| Select the **client (store)** for the **tracking**.

|**Language for the item**
| Set the item's **language**.

|**Item name**
| Select which item **name** is to be used for Criteo.

|**Export images**
| Use the image position to select which **item images** should be exported.

|**Additional item address information**
| Entering an **address suffix** will allow you to see which affiliate provider the respective URLs come from. This suffix is added onto the item's deep link URL.

|
|**Example**: if you use the econda shop monitor, then you can add the parameter **&amp;campaign=criteo** onto the deep links. Doing so will enable econda to display an overview of how many visitors you received from this affiliate partner.

|**Limitation**
| The items considered depend on the setting you choose here: +
**Net stock or no limitation** means that all items that either have **Limited to net stock** or **no stock** selected in their **stock** tab will be considered. +
**Net stock** means that only items that have **Limited to net stock** set in their **stock** tab will be considered. +
**Activated for WebAPI** means that all items for which the option **WebAPI** has been activated in the **Available** tab will be considered.

|**Item selection**
| The default setting **1 - 4000** will be increased if you have more than 4000 items. Then you can choose an item stack e.g. **4001-8000**, **8001-12000** and so on. One stack is always 4000 items.

|**Item export URL**
|**URL** for the **export of the item** in a CSV file. Proceed as follows if you want to use this URL to assign the client (store) - see the client (store) export option:

|
| Add the following extension to the **item export URL** that you transmit to the provider: **&amp;params$multishop=xxx** (**xxx**=**ID** of the corresponding **online store**).

|
|pass:q[<u>**Shop ID**</u>] +
**Default store** = 0 +
**Client (store)** = ID that is displayed for the particular client (store) within the **Basic settings** menu.

|
| If you transmit the URL to the provider with this **additional text**, then the **Client (store) export** setting will not be applied (see above).
