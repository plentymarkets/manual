|**Data format**
|Select **zanox** from the drop-down menu.

|**Name**
|The data format will be listed under this name once it has been created as a submenu within the **Export** tab. You can also edit the data format in this tab.

|**Order referrer**
|Select zanox under **order referrer** in order to have a record that zanox led a customer to your website. +
In doing so, the URL will be extended by the corresponding parameter.

|**Price column**
|Choose between **Automatically**, **Standard price** and **Price 1 - 12**. +
**Automatically** = The price listed in the order referrer will be used. As such, every other setting has a higher priority than the setting in the order referrer. +

|**Apply shipping costs from the shipping cost calculation**
|Select **Configuration 1** or **2**.

There you will also find the settings for the default payment method for the export to price comparison portals. In this menu, either choose one of the configurations saved in the **Calculate shipping costs** tab or choose the setting **Standard/Cash in advance**. +
__**Important**__: The payment method **Cash in advance** should be selected if the chosen configuration (1 or 2) does not contain this payment method.
