|**Order referrer**
|Make the appropriate selection under **order referrer** in order to have a record of which price search engine led a customer to your website. +
In doing so, the URL will be extended by the corresponding parameter. If a customer lands in your store via a price search engine and purchases an item there, then the respective order referrer URL will be saved. +
Go to **Settings » Orders » Order referrer** if you would like to create additional order referrers.
