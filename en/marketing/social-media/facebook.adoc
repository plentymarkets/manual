Facebook is one of the most important social networks worldwide. It also plays an important role in the UK. In plentymarkets, you can integrate a Facebook comment function into your online store. This function allows those customers who are logged into Facebook to comment directly on an item in your online store. You can then reply to these comments or use Facebook to contact the customer.

== Setting up the Facebook comment function

You need to insert code snippets into your **ItemViewSingleItem** template to set up the Facebook comment function. These codes will link Facebook comments with the individual items in your online store. Image 1 shows an example of the comment function. Proceed as described below to set up the Facebook comment function in plentymarkets.

=== Saving your Facebook ID

You need to save your Facebook ID in plentymarkets before the comment function can be linked with your Facebook account and displayed correctly. This Facebook ID is found in your Facebook profile.

[.instruction]
Saving your Facebook ID:

. Go to **CMS » Web design » Layout » folder: PageDesign**.
. Open the **PageDesignContent** template.
. Click on the **PageDesignContentHtmlStructure** tab.
. Insert the following code: +
**&lt;meta property="fb:admins" content="Facebook ID"&gt;**.
. Replace the **Facebook ID** with your own Facebook ID.

=== Optional: Saving your Facebook App ID

In addition to your Facebook ID, you can also save your Facebook App ID. If your site has many comment boxes, Facebook recommends that you specify a Facebook app ID as the administrator. Doing this enables a moderator interface on Facebook that allows you to moderate comments from all plugins administered by your app ID. All administrators of the app will be able to moderate the comments. Register your website with Facebook in order to receive an App ID. Instructions for doing so can be found on the page **link:http://developers.facebook.com/docs/guides/web/#login[http://developers.facebook.com/docs/guides/web/#login]**.

The code for integrating your Facebook app ID is **&lt;meta property="fb:app_id" content="**APP ID**"&gt;**. Insert this code into the **PageDesignContentHtmlStructure** template as described above for the Facebook ID. Then replace **App ID** with your own Facebook App ID.

=== Generating and inserting CMS code

Now you need to generate the code that will insert the comment function into your online store. You can generate the code on this **link:http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/plugins/comments/[Facebook page]**. Enter your online store's URL in the **URL to comment on** line. Then click on **Get Code** to generate the code.

The generated code will be displayed in a new window. It consists of two parts. The first field contains the code for linking the comment function. In other words the part for entering comments. The second part contains the code for displaying comments that were entered. Proceed as follows to insert the two code snippets into your design.

[.instruction]
Inserting the code for the Facebook comment function:

. Go to **CMS » Web design » Layout » folder: ItemView**.
. Open the **ItemViewSingleItem** template.
. Insert part 1 of the Facebook code at the end of the template.
. Check the line containing the language code and make adjustments to the language as necessary. +
**Example:** If you see the code **"//connect.facebook.net/de_DE/all.js#xfbml=1"** but you would like to use the English language instead, then replace the **de_DE** language code with "//connect.facebook.net/**en_UK**/all.js#xfbml=1".
. Click on the **save icon** to save the settings.

The lower field contains the code for positioning the comment function on the webpage. Insert the code into the **ItemViewSingleItem** template. Position the code where you would like the comments to be displayed.

[.instruction]
Inserting the code for positioning and displaying the Facebook comments:

. Go to **CMS » Web design » Layout » folder: ItemView**.
. Open the **ItemViewSingleItem** template.
. Insert the second part of the Facebook code into the template. Position the code where you would like the comments to be displayed.
. Go to **Settings » Client (store) » Standard » SEO » URL structure** and check whether you saved the setting **relative links** for the option **internal website linking**. If so, then replace the **data-href="YOUR_DOMAIN"** part of the code with the following: **data-href="$BaseURL4Links$CanonicalUrl**.
. Click on the **save icon** to save the settings.

[IMPORTANT]
.**Canonical tags**
====
Do not add your own canonical tag to the page, e.g. &lt;link href="http://www.your-store.co.uk" rel="canonical" /&gt; because plentymarkets inserts canonical tags automatically.
