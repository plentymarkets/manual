:description: Learn how to set up email templates and automatically send emails to your customers.
:position: 30

All emails that are sent with plentymarkets are based on email templates. Go to **Settings » Client (store) » Standard » Email » Templates** to configure email templates. You can create as many email templates as desired. In case of certain events, e.g. if a new order is placed in your online store or when a customer subscribes to a newsletter, your plentymarkets system automatically creates emails from these templates and sends them to your customers. You configure which emails are sent when.

== Saving the email signature

Go to **Settings » Client (store) » Standard » Email » Signature** to save the signature. The signature will then be automatically inserted into an email template.

[IMPORTANT]
.
====
Please note the legal requirements that are in effect for your online store as to the content of an email signature, e.g. specifying the VAT number. Email signatures are required to include the same information as company business letters. Non-compliance can result in a fine or in a costly warning being issued by a competitor. If in doubt, ask a specialised solicitor.
====

[.instruction]
Saving the email signature:

. Go to **Settings » Client (store) » Standard » Email » Signature**.
. Enter the text of your signature. Pay attention to the explanations given in the green box.
. **Save** the settings.

[TIP]
.Formatting the signature by means of the HTML editor
====
You choose whether you save the text of your signature as **plain text signature** or **HTML signature**. If you want to format the text, it is recommended to enter the text in the **HTML signature** area. An integrated HTML editor is provided to assist you with editing and formatting.

Go to **Settings » Basic settings » Editors** and determine which editors should be available for certain areas in your plentymarkets system. Choose between **Editor**, **Syntax editor** and **Text field**.

[#700]
== Setting up the email information service

In the **Settings » Client (store) » Standard » Email » Information service** menu, you have the possibility of sending a "blind copy" (BCC) of all emails sent by your plentymarkets system to an email address of your choice. This can be particularly helpful in the early stages of your online store, as it allows you to maintain an overview of all sent emails and recognise where processes can still be improved. You can, for example, also configure your settings so that you automatically receive an informational email for each order.

[.instruction]
Setting up the email information service:

. Go to **Settings » Client (store) » Standard » Email » Information service**.
. Carry out the settings as desired. Pay attention to the information given in table 5.
. **Save** the settings.

.Setting up the email information service
[cols="a,a"]
|====
|Setting |Explanation

|**All outgoing emails are sent as blind copies (BCC) to the email address entered in the next line**
|Select whether all outgoing emails are sent as BCC to one or multiple email addresses. The email addresses are entered in the next line. +
**YES** = The option is activated. +
**NO** = The option is deactivated (default setting).

|**Email address for blind copy**
|Enter the email address(es). If you enter multiple email addresses, separate them with commas and do not use spaces.

|**Deactivate blind copies (BCC) for the newsletter**
|Select whether blind copies (BCC) should be sent for newsletters. +
Activate option = No blind copies are sent for newsletters. +
Deactivate option = Blind copies are sent for newsletters (default setting).

[#800]
== Configuring the HTML design

Use the **Settings » Client (store) » Standard » Email » HTML design** menu to configure an HTML design for each client (store). The HTML design can then be linked to email templates. You can activate or deactivate the design separately for every email template. Use this function to ensure that for example the letterhead including the logo of your company will automatically appear in all selected email templates. By doing so, it is no longer needed to insert the letterhead and the logo for each email template individually. If you make changes in this menu, you will change the design for all linked email templates.

If you wish to create your email templates without a centrally saved HTML design, proceed with the <<crm/sending-emails#1200, **Creating an email template** >> chapter.

[#900]
=== Inserting the company logo in the HTML design

You can adapt your email templates to the design of your online store, e.g. by inserting your company logo in the HTML design. First, you have to upload the logo to the image gallery. Afterwards, you insert the logo in the HTML design. To do so, proceed as described in the following.

[.instruction]
Uploading the company logo to the image gallery:

. Go to **CMS » Image gallery**.
. Click on the folder that you want to upload the logo to. +
→ Alternatively, create a new folder.
. Upload the logo to the folder by clicking on **Upload files** or by using the drag &amp; drop function. +
→ The logo will be uploaded.
. Click on the image. +
→ The window with the name of the image will open.
. Copy the URL from the field **Absolute URL**.
. Close the window.

For further information, refer to the <<omni-channel/online-store/cms/image-gallery#, **Image gallery**  >> page of the manual.

In the next step, you insert the logo via an image link in the HTML design of an already created email template. To do so, proceed as follows.

[.instruction]
Inserting the company logo in the HTML design:

. Go to **Settings » Client (store) » Standard » Email » Templates**.
. Open the email template which you want to insert the logo in.
. Click on the **Email message** tab.
. Click on the **Text in HTML format** tab within the **Content** tab.
. Select the **Editor** from the top right drop-down menu. +
→ Two toolbar to format the text will be displayed.
. Click on **Image** in the toolbar. +
→ The **Image properties** window will open.
. Paste the absolute URL that you have just copied from the image gallery in the field **URL**.
. Click on **OK**. +
→ The logo will be displayed.
. **Save** the settings.

[#1000]
=== Inserting template variables in the HTML design

First, insert the template variables **$EmailContentHTML** and **$SignatureHTML** in the HTML design. Afterwards, <<crm/sending-emails#1100, **link** >> the HTML design with the email template.

[IMPORTANT]
.$EmailContentHTMLmust be present
====
The template variable **$EmailContentHTML** must be inserted in the HTML design. Otherwise, the HTML design cannot be used.
====

[.instruction]
Inserting template variables in the HTML design:

. Go to **Settings » Client (store) » Standard » Email » HTML design**.
. Insert the template variables **$EmailContentHTML** and **$SignatureHTML**. +
→ **$EmailContentHTML** contains the content of the email. **$SignatureHTML** contains the signature.
. Format the HTML design as desired.
. **Save** the settings.

.Example for the HTML design
image::crm/assets/DE-Einstellungen-Mandant-Standard-E-Mail-HTML-Design-01-SI.png[]
[#1100]
=== Linking the HTML design with an email template

Go to **Settings » Client (store) » Standard » Email » Templates**. Carry out the following settings to link the HTML design with an email template. Make sure that the content of the email template is saved in the **Text in HTML format** tab. Save the content there if it was not saved already. This content will be displayed with the template variable **$EmailContentHTML**.

[.instruction]
Linking the HTML design with the email template:

. Go to **Settings » Client (store) » Standard » Email » Templates**.
. Select the email template from the folder.
. Select the option **Only text in HTML format** from the drop-down menu in the **Content** line.
. Activate the option **Use design**.
. Enter a subject in the **Email message** tab.
. **Save** the settings.

[#1200]
== Creating an email template

Go to **Settings » Client (store) » Standard » Email » Templates** to create new email templates. The folder **General email templates** already contains preconfigured email templates. You can of course make changes to these templates.

You can define up to two attachments for each email template. Use email templates to automatically send your customers a PDF document that was generated in the **Orders » Fulfilment** menu, such as an invoice, as well as a document uploaded in the **CMS » Documents** menu, such as a brochure or instructions. For example, it would be useful to attach PDF documents of your cancellation rights and terms and conditions to the email template **Confirmation of online store order**.

[TIP]
.Sending reversal document and invoice in one email template
====
The option **Reversal document and new invoice** has been added to the **PDF attachment** drop-down menu of an email template. If the order changes after the invoice has been created, you can send your customers both documents in one email.
====

[.instruction]
Creating an email template:

. Go to **Settings » Client (store) » Standard » Email » Templates**.
. Click on **New email template**. +
→ The **New email template** window will open.
. Enter the name for the template.
. Select an owner or the setting **All** from the drop-down menu **Owner**.
. Click on **Save**. +
→ The email template will be created and saved in one of the three folders - depending on the selected setting in the **Owner** drop-down menu.
. Carry out the remaining settings. Pay attention to the information given in table 6.
. **Save** the settings.

.Settings in the **Settings » Client (store) » Standard » Email » Templates** menu
[cols="a,a"]
|====
|Setting |Explanation

2+|Tab: Settings

|**Owner**
|Select an owner or the setting **All**. +
**All** = The template will be saved under **General email templates**. +
Own user name = The template will be saved under **My email templates**. +
A different user = The template will be saved under **Email templates from other users**. +
**__Note__**: You have to be logged into your plentymarkets system as a user in order to create your own email templates under **My email templates**.

|**Name**
|Enter the name for the template. This name will not be displayed to the recipient.

|**Content**
|Select whether the content of the email template should be saved as **plain text** or in **HTML format**. +
**__Tip:__** Use text in HTML format. The link for order processing (template function **Link_Checkout()**) can be very long. Pure text emails can lead to line breaks that can damage the link.

|**Template type**
|Select **All** (default setting), **Order**, **Customers**, **Online store** or **Ticket**. +
**All** = The email template will be used for all areas. +
**Order**/**Customers**/**Online store**/**Ticket** = The email template will only be available for the selected area. It will not be available in other areas, i.e. it will be invisible in other areas.

|**PDF attachment**
|Select an attachment. The documents that can be selected from this drop-down menu are for example generated in the **Orders » Fulfilment** menu.

|**Document attachment**
|Documents that were uploaded under **CMS » Documents** are displayed here. You can attach one of these documents to an email template.

|**Reply to**
|Enter an email address. If someone replies to the email template, then their message will be sent to this address. If no email address was entered, then replies to the template will be sent to the email address that was saved under <<crm/sending-emails#100, **Settings » Client (store) » Standard » Email » Access data** >>. For example, it is useful to enter the accounting department's email address for the **PDF invoice** email template. Questions about the invoice would then directly be sent to your accounting department and wouldn't have to be forwarded to them in an extra step.

|**Use design**
|Activate if the content of the email should be sent with the design that was saved under **Settings » Client (store) » Standard » Email » HTML design**. If the option is not activated, then only the content of the email template will be used.

|**Client (store)**
|Activate one, multiple or **ALL** clients (stores). The email template is only valid for the selected clients (stores).

2+|Tab: Email message

|**Select a language**
|The selected language is displayed here and can be changed.

|**Subject**
|Enter the subject text. Choose the subject carefully so that the emails will be recognised by the email account and displayed in the customer's inbox instead of his or her spam folder.

|**Content / Item list**
|Insert the text or list of items in these tabs. Use **Plain text** or **Text in HTML format**. Template variables and template functions can be used to display the content. +
**__Note__**: Check which type of content was selected in the **Settings** tab under **Content**. Enter the text of the email into this corresponding tab. For example, if **Plain text only** is selected but you entered content into the **Text in HTML format** tab, then this content will not be sent in the email.
|====

[TIP]
.Tip: Use text in HTML format
====
plentymarkets recommends that you use text which was formatted with HTML since the link for processing orders can be very long. Pure text emails can lead to line breaks that can damage the link. Furthermore, if you use HTML-formatted text, you have the possibility to format the text by means of the integrated HTML editor.

Go to **Settings » Basic settings » Editors** and determine which editors should be available for certain areas in your plentymarkets system. Choose between **Editor**, **Syntax editor** and **Text field**.
====

[#1300]
=== Using template variables and template functions

Template variables and template functions can be used in email templates. In place of the variable or the function, your plentymarkets system will automatically display the content that this variable or function represents. In this way, only the content will be displayed in the email. If you use the <<crm/using-the-ticket-system#4800, **ticket system** >>, then some template variables can also be used as assignment parameters.

Open an email template in the **Settings » Client (store) » Standard » Email » Templates** menu to display a list of all template variables and template functions that are available for your email templates.

For an overview of the template variables and template functions for email templates, refer to the <<omni-channel/online-store/cms-syntax#, **CMS syntax**  >> chapter on the <<omni-channel/online-store/cms-syntax/email/email#, **Email**  >> page of the manual. For general information about template variables and template functions, refer to the <<omni-channel/online-store/cms-syntax/basics#, **Basics**  >> page of the manual.

[TIP]
.Inserting the link to the checkout in the email template
====
If possible, every email that is sent to a customer should include a link to the checkout. The customer can use this link to look at the current status of his or her order any time. Insert the template function **Link_Checkout()** in the email template.
====

[#1400]
=== Configuring the display of stock units

You can individually configure the way that the stock unit lines are structured for each email template and language. <<crm/sending-emails#1500, **If queries** >> can also be used for the configuration of stock units. If you do not configure how the stock units should be displayed, then plentymarkets will display a standard list of the stock units.

[.instruction]
Configuring the display of stock units:

. Go to **Settings » Client (store) » Standard » Email » Templates**.
. Open the template.
. Click on the **Email message** tab. +
→ The **Content** tab will be displayed.
. Insert the template variable **$ItemListHTML** in the tab **Text in HTML format** or the template variable **$ItemListPlain** in the tab **Plain text** in the email's **Content** tab. Position the template variable where you would like the stock units to be displayed.
. Copy the template variables that you need for the stock units and insert them into the **Item list** tab. The template variables can be copied from the overview. +
→ To help with the formatting, for example, you can insert tabs that you copied from a text program between the template variables.
. **Save** the settings.

[.subhead]
Example: displaying stock units

Insert the template variables to display the item ID (**$ItemID**), the item name (**$ItemName**) and the item price (**$ItemPrice**) of the stock units. The display begins with a hyphen (see image 2). This is used at the start of each new line, even if multiple stock units are shown. In order for the display to "work" on multiple lines, insert a line break at the end of the line by pressing Enter. The template variables in this example result in the email being displayed as follows:

.Display of the stock units in the email template

How you open the preview is described in the <<crm/sending-emails#1600, **Checking the email template using the preview function** >> chapter.

[#1500]
=== Using if queries in email templates

You can use if queries in email templates to display specific information on a case-by-case basis. For example, you can save a code that causes bank details to only be displayed in the email to the customer if cash in advance (ID = 0) was selected as the payment method.

. **Save** the settings.

[TIP]
.Check email template after every change
====
You should use an order's email service to check every change that is made to a template. In particular, you should check to make sure that the link for order processing works correctly. To do so, proceed as described in the <<crm/sending-emails#1600, **Checking the email template using the preview function** >> chapter.
====

[#1800]
== Sending emails

In order to send emails, user data has to be saved in the **<<basics/working-with-plentymarkets/manage-users#10, Settings » Basic settings » User » Accounts >>** menu. This data can be received from your provider and corresponds to the data that is saved in your email program.

[#1900]
=== Sending ticket messages and comments as emails

An email account must be saved in the <<crm/using-the-ticket-system#2100, **Settings » Customers » Ticket system » Email accounts** >> menu in order for messages and comments to be sent as emails. You also have to set up an email template that displays the last ticket message or comment. This email template has to be linked to an **<<crm/using-the-ticket-system#2900, event procedure >>** in order for messages and comments to be sent via email. For further information, refer to the <<crm/using-the-ticket-system#2100, **Using the ticket system** >> page of the manual.

[#2300]
== Setting up automatic emails

The **Settings » Client (store) » Standard » Email » Automatic email** menu contains various events that can be linked with an email template. Select the email template that you have previously <<crm/sending-emails#1200, **created** >> in the **Settings » Client (store) » Standard » Email » Templates** menu from the drop-down menu. This will ensure that the email template will be sent to your customer once the event occurs.

[IMPORTANT]
.Removing the link before deleting the email template
====
Deleting an email template that is linked with an event in the **Automatic email** section may lead to undesired effects. Therefore, first go to **Settings » Client (store) » Standard » Email » Automatic email** and remove the link by selecting the option **Do not send** from the drop-down menu in the line of the event. Afterwards, you can delete the email template in the **Settings » Client (store) » Standard » Email » Templates** menu.
====

[.instruction]
Setting up automatic emails:

Table 7 lists explanations of some of the events.

.Explanations of some events in the **Settings » Client (store) » Standard » Email » Automatic email** menu
[cols="a,a"]
|====
|Setting |Explanation

|**New order from online store**
|The customers receive an email including the order confirmation after the purchase has been completed in the online store.

|**Send customer email to change password**
|The customers receive an email with a link to the new password. The link must be actively confirmed. The template function **{% Link_ChangePassword() %}** must be included in the email template.

|**Newsletter opt-in**
|The customers receive an email when they have registered for the newsletter. The email template should include the confirmation link that the customers have to click in order to complete the newsletter registration process.

|**Newsletter opt-in confirmation**
|The customers receive a confirmation email once they have activated the confirmation link that was sent with the email template for the **Newsletter opt-in** event.

|**Reminder in case of aborted purchase**
|The customers receive a reminder email that one or multiple items are in the shopping cart, but the purchase has not been completed yet. It also makes sense for the email template to include a link to the shopping cart. Customers can then click on this link to complete their purchase. Simply insert your online store's URL with the suffix **/basket/** (example: **https://myshop.co.uk/basket/**). +
The only requirement is that potential buyers were registered and logged into your online store. Otherwise the email address will not be available and the email template cannot be sent automatically. +
**__Important__**: Due to missing previous consent of the recipient, this kind of emailing can be considered to be unsolicited message (spam). Therefore, it is recommended to ask a specialised solicitor.

|**Tell-A-Friend**
|This event sends an email with the link to an item from the online store as a recommendation to an email address that the customers have entered in the Tell-A-Friend form in the online store.

|**Registration for sweepstakes**
|The customers that have registered for the sweepstake receive a confirmation email.

|**Email when item becomes available**
|The customers receive an email containing the information that a certain item is available again. Beforehand, the customers have entered their email address directly next to the item that could not be delivered at that time.

Setting up an event procedure[#2310]

It is also possible to set up event procedures in the **Settings » Orders » Event procedures** menu. Define an event, activate one or more filters and decide which procedures your plentymarkets system should carry out automatically when the event occurs. For example, you can use filters to trigger a procedure once a customer has placed a certain number of orders. The procedure could be sending an email that includes a gift card. For further information, refer to the <<order-processing/orders/settings/event-procedures#, **Event procedures**  >> page of the manual.

Go to **Start » Statistics** to create a new statistic. Select the statistic type **Sent email templates** in the **Orders** section. This statistic shows information about the emails sent with your plentymarkets system according to the ID and the name of the email template. This statistical feedback is made for each date within the selected time span. The standard setting of the time span is the last 30 days. You can also adapt the time span or select a starting date and an ending date.

In this statistic, you can see for example which email template was used during the selected time period. This helps you to easily recognise which processes were carried out on a regular basis.
