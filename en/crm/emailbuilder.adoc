[IMPORTANT]
.EmailBuilder is continuously being developed further
====
On this page, we will present you the functions of the new EmailBuilder. The EmailBuilder is continuously being developed further; more functions and features will be added. In the course of development, also this page of the user manual will be completed step-by-step.
====

The EmailBuilder is a modular construction kit for quickly creating and editing your email templates via drag-and-drop. No programming skills are required.

The EmailBuilder consists of 2 views: the configuration manager and the editor. With the configuration manager, you create folders and, if needed, sub-folders, templates as well as templates for your footer and your header. With the editor, you fill your templates, headers and footers with content. You can create a template for an invoice, for example, and use this template for all invoices that are sent to your customers in the future. +
You can then use the header and footer templates in the email templates as desired. Header and footer are globally active; changes you make to the header and footer affect the rest of all existing templates and all other templates that you will create in the future.

The header, the footer and the settings in the template such as the name, the subject etc. form the framework of your email, so to say. The content of the template is formed with widgets and variables. In the emails that are sent to your customer, the variables will then be replaced with the correct content. For example: The variable `Delivery address First name and last name` will be replaced in the email with the first name and the last name of the contact from the delivery address.

[#manage-folders]
== Managing folders

You can create as many folders and sub-folders as you like in the EmailBuilder. After you created a folder, you can create new sub-folders, new templates in general and new header and footer templates via the context menu (icon:more_vert[set=material]).

Your plentymarkets system contains a folder with pre-defined default templates. These are explained further down on this page in the <<#use-default-templates, Using default templates>> chapter.

[TIP]
.Create a draft for your folder structure in advance
====
We recommend creating a draft in advance to avoid confusing and unclear nesting levels in your folder structure. Because: The more levels you create, the more complex the structure will be.
====

[.instruction]
Creating a sub-folder:

. Go to *CRM » EmailBuilder (Test phase)*.
. In the line of the folder that you want to create a sub-folder for, click on the context menu (icon:more_vert[set=material]). +
→ A window opens.
. Click on icon:plus[] *New sub-folder*. +
→ The *Create new folder* window opens.

[#manage-templates]
== Managing templates

Learn in the following sub-chapters how to create, search for and edit templates for <<#create-header, headers>> and <<#create-footer, footers>> and <<#create-template, general templates>>. You can also use pre-defined <<#use-default-templates, default templates>>. Moreover, you will learn everything about the available <<#insert-widget, widgets>> and how you can use these widgets.

The widgets and variables that are contained in the template form the actual content of your email. Via the widgets, you can insert as many variables as you like into a template by using drag-and-drop. These variables will then be replaced with the correct content when the email is sent to your customers.

To see which variables are available for your email templates, refer to the lists on the bottom of this page in the <<#variables-emailbuilder, Available variables for the EmailBuilder>> chapter.


[#template-header-footer]
=== Creating templates for header and footer

Create templates for the header and the footer that you can later use in all of your email templates. Header and footer are globally active. This means: changes you make to the header and footer affect the rest of all existing templates and all other templates that you will create in the future.

You can insert, for example, your company logo into the header and insert into the footer your signature and the general company details such as the address, links to social media, the legal structure of your company, details about your company’s executive board, and much more.

Proceed as described below to create a template for the <<#create-header, header>> and the <<#create-footer, footer>>.

Now structure the content of your email by inserting variables via the widgets. How to proceed is described in the following chapter <<insert-widget#, Inserting a widget into a template>>.


[#insert-widget]
=== Inserting a widget into a template

In the editor, you can find a selection of widgets whose contents are already pre-configured for you. For example, you will find in the *Order items* widget a pre-defined list with the most important variables around the ordered item such as item name, the number of ordered items, the prices, the shipping costs and the total invoice amount. You can, however, customise the content anytime and add more column names and single positions. <<#image-emailbuilder-widget-order-items>> shows the editing mode of the pre-defined *Order items* widget.

Before you <<#create-folder, created a new folder>>, you might have recognised the folders *Standardvorlagen* and *Default templates*? These folders contain pre-defined templates in German and English language. You can use the templates as they are or adjust the contents just as you like.

Besides the content of the email, the name of the template as well as the subject are already filled in in a default template. This means that you only have to select the header and footer and fill the fields *Reply to* and, if needed, also *CC* and *BCC*.

If you want to have another variable displayed in the subject line, put the English variable into a double curly bracket and – if present – replace the blank space with a dot. +
Example: Replace *orderId* with *{{order.id}}*.
