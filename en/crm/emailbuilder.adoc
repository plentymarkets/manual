.EmailBuilder is continuously being developed further
====
On this page, we will present you the functions of the new EmailBuilder. The EmailBuilder is continuously being developed further; more functions and features will be added. In the course of development, also this page of the user manual will be completed step-by-step.
====

All emails that are sent with plentymarkets are based on templates. You create and manage templates with the EmailBuilder in the *CRM » EmailBuilder (Test phase)* menu.

The EmailBuilder is a modular construction kit for quickly creating and editing your email templates via drag-and-drop. No programming skills are required.

The EmailBuilder consists of 2 views: the configuration manager and the editor. With the configuration manager, you create folders and, if needed, sub-folders, templates as well as templates for your footer and your header. With the editor, you fill your templates, headers and footers with content. You can create a template for an invoice, for example, and use this template for all invoices that are sent to your customers in the future. +
You can then use the header and footer templates in the email templates as desired. Header and footer are globally active; changes you make to the header and footer affect the rest of all existing templates and all other templates that you will create in the future.

The header, the footer and the settings in the template such as the name, the subject etc. form the framework of your email, so to say. The content of the template is formed with widgets and variables. In the emails that are sent to your customer, the variables will then be replaced with the correct content. For example: The variable `Delivery address First name and last name` will be replaced in the email with the first name and the last name of the contact from the delivery address.

In case of certain events, e.g. if a new order is placed in your online shop or when a contact subscribes to a newsletter, your plentymarkets system automatically creates emails from these templates and sends them to your contacts.

[#preparatory-settings]

[[table-email-server-login-details]]
.Saving the email server's login details
[cols="1,3"]
|====
|Setting |Explanation

| *Test mode*
| Select *Active* or *Inactive*. +
*Active* = The test mode is activated. All emails are only sent to the saved email address. This allows you to test the settings before switching to the live mode. +
*Inactive* = The live mode is activated. +
*_Important:_* The test mode is only applied to this online store. The settings for additional clients (stores) are carried out in the client's menu.

| *Name of sender*
|Enter your name or the name of the online shop. The name is displayed to the recipient. Avoid using special characters in order to allow for correct display.

| *Email address*
|Enter the email address as it is listed in the email programme.

| *Outgoing mail server/SMTP server*
|Enter the outgoing mail server as specified by the provider (usually smtp.domain.co.uk or mail.domain.co.uk). +
*_mailbox.org:_* For mailbox.org mailboxes, enter the outgoing mail server *smtp.mailbox.org* and select the encryption method *SSL*.

| *User name*
|Enter the user name that matches the email address. +
*_mailbox.org:_* The mailbox.org user name is the complete email address of the mailbox.org mailbox.

| *Password*
|Enter the password that matches the user name and email address.

| *Port (standard port: 25)*
|Enter the value *25*. This value is correct for nearly all providers. Otherwise, ask your provider about the correct port. +

|====

[TIP]
.Entering newsletter login details
====
Go to *Setup » Client » [Select client] » Email » Newsletter*. Enter the login details to use the newsletter service that is integrated in plentymarkets. For further information, refer to the <<crm/sending-newsletters#200, Entering newsletter login details>> chapter of the <<crm/sending-newsletters#, Newsletters>> page of the manual.
====

[#email-signature]
=== Saving the email signature

Go to *Setup» Client » [Select client] » Email » Signature* to save the signature. The signature is then automatically added to your email templates when you inserted the corresponding variable in the template.

[IMPORTANT]
.Note the priority of the signature
====
The signature that was saved for a user in his or her user account in the *Setup » Settings » User » Accounts* menu takes priority over the signature that is saved in the *Setup » Client » Select client » Email » Signature* menu. +
*_This means:_* If you insert, for example, the variable `Signature in HTML format` in the template, the signature is taken from the user account. If no signature is saved in the user account, the signature that is saved in the *Setup » Client » [Select client] » Email » Signature* menu is used.
====

// If you inserted the template variable `Signature in plain text` in the email template, the signature that is saved in the *Setup » Client » [Select client] » Email » Signature* menu is always used.




[#manage-folders]
== Managing folders

You can create as many folders and sub-folders as you like in the EmailBuilder. After you created a folder, you can create new sub-folders, new templates in general and new header and footer templates by clicking on icon:more_vert[set=material].

Your plentymarkets system contains a folder with pre-defined default templates. These are explained further down on this page in the <<#use-default-templates, Using default templates>> chapter.

You can also use pre-defined <<#use-default-templates, default templates>>. Moreover, you will learn everything about the available <<#insert-widget, widgets>> and how you can use these widgets.

The widgets and variables that are contained in the template form the actual content of your email. Via the widgets, you can insert as many variables as you like into a template by using drag-and-drop. These variables will then be replaced with the correct content when the email is sent to your customers.

To see which variables are available for your email templates, refer to the lists on the bottom of this page in the <<#variables-emailbuilder, Available variables for the EmailBuilder>> chapter.


[#template-header-footer]
=== Creating templates for header and footer

Create templates for the header and the footer that you can later use in all of your email templates. Header and footer are globally active. This means: changes you make to the header and footer affect the rest of all existing templates and all other templates that you will create in the future.

You can insert, for example, your company logo into the header and insert into the footer your signature and the general company details such as the address, links to social media, the legal structure of your company, details about your company’s executive board, and much more.
