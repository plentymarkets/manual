== Creating a customer class

Use customer classes to categorise your customer base according to specific criteria. For example, you can create a customer class for consumers (B2C) that displays gross prices for the items in your online store. For sellers (B2B), you create another customer class that displays net prices for the items in your online store. Further options are discounts based on the net value of your items, discounts based on the payment method or discount scales for a selected customer class.

Go to *System » CRM » Classes* to create new customer classes. The customer classes that you have created in this menu will then be available in the customer data record. If no customer class is selected, then the class with the lowest position number will automatically be assigned in the customer data.

[TIP]
.Tip: Create types and classes
====
It is recommended to create a concept for organising your customer base into types and classes before saving customer data. By doing this, you will save time later on. For example, types and classes are automatically assigned when the initial configuration is missing. Decide which types and classes you need, create them accordingly and assign them to the customers.
====

You can set up and individually configure as many customer classes as you like. An ID is automatically assigned to customer classes. This ID is displayed to the left of the customer classes' name in the overview. However, customer classes are not ordered by ID. Instead, the order is set using the option *Position*.

When you create a new customer class, it is shown in the *Customer classes* tab. Reload the menu after making changes to display the new settings in the overview.

[.instruction]
Creating a customer class:

. Go to *System » CRM » Classes*.
. Click on the *New customer class* tab.
. Carry out the settings. Pay attention to the information given in <<table-create-customer-class>>.
. *Save* the settings.

[[table-create-customer-class]]
.Settings in the *System » CRM » Classes* menu
[cols="a,a"]
|====
|Setting |Explanation

|*Minimum order quantity*
|Enter the minimum order quantity if you want to require customers to order a specific quantity of items or if you want to require them to order a minimum quantity to get a discount.

|*Name*
|Enter a name for the new customer class, e.g. *wholesaler* or *premium customer*.

|*Position*
|If you do not enter a position, the next available position number will be assigned automatically. The position is primarily used to sort the customer classes in the menu. It is relevant e.g. in combination with the visibility of item prices in the online store. This can be set under *Display of the prices in the online store*.

|*Payment due*
|Enter a payment deadline in days for this customer class. If a payment due date is also saved for a customer in the *Customer data* tab, then it has priority over the payment due date saved here. The payment due date can also be saved as an optional field on <<order-processing/orders/order-documents#, documents>> such as <<order-processing/orders/order-documents/generating-invoices#, invoices>>. The invoice's payment due date would be used if no other payment due date was saved in the customer data record or the customer class. Pay attention to the box *Info: Example terms of payment* below <<table-create-customer-data-record>> in the <<crm/managing-customer-data#800, Creating a customer data record >> chapter.

|*Customer ID*
|Specify the customer who is to receive the multi-invoices that are created from <<order-processing/orders/multi-orders#, multi-orders>>. Simply enter the customer ID. Multi-orders will be generated for this customer class and the invoice will be sent to that customer.

|*Discount type*
|Select a discount type. The number of options that are visible depends on which discount type was selected. If you do no want to offer a discount, select the option *No discount*. Further information and explanations about the discount types in plentymarkets can be found in the <<crm/managing-customer-data#3900, Using the discount system>> chapter.

|*Volume discount*
|Select whether the value entered in the *System » Item » Sales prices* menu under *Minimum quantity* should be taken into account or not.

|*Permitted payment methods*
|Select which of the payment methods that are available in the online store should be permitted for this customer class. +
All of the available payment methods are selected by default. When you integrate new payment methods, you have to permit them here. This is because new payment methods are not automatically included in this list. +
*_Important_*: Pay attention to which <<order-processing/fulfilment/preparing-the-shipment#1000, payment methods are blocked in the shipping profiles>> that you want to use for this customer class. Check those settings to make sure that they are compatible with the settings you make here. If you want to permit a payment method for a customer class, then you should make sure it is not blocked in the shipping profiles. Make sure that the corresponding customer class is not blocked either.

|*Payment instruction*
|The payment instructions that are saved here will be displayed on invoices. For example, you could enter payment information that relates to a specific customer class.

|*Display of the prices in the online store*
|Select whether *Gross* or *net* prices are displayed in the online store. +
*_Important_*: This option only sets how prices are displayed. It does not influence the way prices are calculated for the customer class. This option is particularly important for the customer class with position 1. This customer class is automatically assigned to customers if no customer class was selected in the customer data.
|====

You can link sales prices with customer classes. Go to *System » Items » Sales prices* and select one of the customer classes that you created under the setting *Class*. For further information, refer to the <<item/managing-items#870, Managing sales prices>> chapter on the <<item/managing-items#, Managing items>> page of the manual.

== Searching for customers of a specific customer class

You can also use customer classes to search for specific customers. Use the search filter *Class* in the *CRM » Edit customer* menu to do so.

[.instruction]
Searching for customers of a specific customer class:

. Go to *CRM » Edit customer*.
. In the *Filter* tab, select the customer class in the drop-down menu *Class* to display all customers of this customer class.
. Click on *Search*. +
→ All customer data records with the selected customer class will be displayed in the *Customers* tab.

[#300]
== Creating a customer type

Customer types are used to classify and differentiate customers. Some customer types are available by default in your plentymarkets system and cannot be deleted. These types are *Customer*, *Sales representative*, *Supplier*, *Partners*, *Manufacturer* and *Interested party*. The customer types that you have created are available in the *Filter* tab in the *Type* drop-down menu in the *CRM » Edit customer* menu.

The customer type *Customer* is automatically set by default. Customers who were assigned to the customer type *Supplier* are available to select in certain drop-down menus, e.g. in a variation's *Supplier* tab. Create further types in the *System » CRM » Types* menu.

Proceed as described below to create customer types.

[.instruction]
Creating a customer type:

. Go to *System » CRM » Types*.
. Click on *Add type*.
. Enter a name.
. *Save* the settings.

[.subhead]
Deleting a customer type

Proceed as described below to irreversibly delete a customer type if it is no longer needed. Note that you cannot delete customer types that are already available in your plentymarkets system by default.

[.instruction]
Deleting a customer type:

. Go to *System » CRM » Types*.
. Click on *Delete*.
. Confirm your decision.

[#400]
== Creating a characteristic

Go to *System » CRM » Characteristics* to create characteristics that you will later use for characterising your customers. There are two possibilities for using the characteristics later: On the one hand, you can ask your customers to provide the necessary information during the order process or customer registration. On the other hand, you can use the characteristics to enter information about the customer yourself.

If you ask your customers to provide this information, then specify whether the entry is mandatory or not, i.e. whether customers are required to provide this information. For example, you could ask customers how they heard about your online store during the registration process. Set up this characteristic by selecting the options *Single-line text* or *Multi-line text* as the *Type*. This will create a text field in which customers can enter the relevant information.

Proceed as described below to create a customer characteristic.

[.instruction]
Creating a characteristic:

. Go to *System » CRM » Characteristics*.
. Click on the *New characteristic* tab.
. Carry out the settings. Pay attention to the information given in <<table-create-characteristic>>.

|Once a characteristic has been saved in the default language of your plentymarkets system, you can save the texts in <<crm/managing-customer-data#600, other languages>> as well.

|*Type*
|The type specifies the kind of information your customers have to enter for the characteristic. Select one of the following options: *Number*, *Selection*, *Single-line text*, *Multi-line text*, *Date* or *Customer type*.

|*Selection*
|Only visible if the setting *Selection* was selected under *Type*. You may enter as many characteristic values as you like. +
A drop-down menu with different options will be created for the characteristic. This drop-down menu will then be displayed in the order process, for example. +
*Name* = Enter a name for the characteristic. +
*Value* = Enter a number between 0 and 50. Use consecutive numbers to list the entries in ascending order. Select the order in which search results should be displayed. +
*Add value* = Add further fields.

|*Customer type*
|Only visible if the setting *Customer type* was selected under *Type*. Multiple selection is allowed here. You can assign multiple customer types to one characteristic. You can choose from the system's default customer types as well as the <<crm/managing-customer-data#300, customer types that you additionally created>>.

|*Position*
|Select the characteristic's position from the drop-down menu. Assign consecutive position numbers to achieve the desired order of characteristics.

|*Mandatory field*
|Activate this option to make sure that the characteristic will be a mandatory field. +
If the characteristic is defined as a mandatory field, it will be displayed in bold font in the *Characteristics* tab of the customer data and during the order process. This means that the customer data clearly shows which characteristics are displayed as mandatory fields in the online store and that customers can see which characteristic fields are mandatory at a glance.

|*Customer search*
|Only visible if the setting *Selection* was selected under *Type*. Activate in order that the property will be available in the customer search in the *CRM » Edit customer » Tab: Filter* menu.

*Permit* = the customer can pay using this payment method, even if you do not offer this method globally. +
*_Example_*: If you want to allow one of your regular customers to buy items on invoice. +
Necessary settings: Go to *System » Orders » Payment » Payment methods* to activate the payment method. This makes it possible to select the payment method in an order. +
Make sure that no countries of delivery were saved in the settings of the payment method. Otherwise, the payment method would be available to all customers in the online store, which is not desired in this case. +
The second requirement is that the payment method *Invoice* or *Debit* has to be available in at least one shipping profile, i.e. the payment method may not be blocked. +
The third requirement is that this shipping profile is activated for items. +
Check the requirements that are listed here and then activate the payment method. This will allow the customer to use the payment method.

|*Personal identity number*
|Scandinavian end customers need the personal identity number for Scandinavian payment providers (e.g. Klarna). Customers can enter their personal identity number during the checkout process in the online store as well as in the my account area. Go to *CMS » Web design » Order process » Checkout* to configure how the personal identity number should be queried during the checkout process. Customise the settings in the areas <<omni-channel/online-store/setting-up-clients/cms#web-design-editing-the-web-design-order-process-checkout, Customer registration>> and *Invoice address*. Go to *CMS » Web design » My account* and expand the <<omni-channel/online-store/setting-up-clients/cms#web-design-editing-the-web-design-my-account, Personal data>> area to configure how the personal identity number should be queried in the my account area.

[TIP]
.Info: example terms of payment
====
You can use the options *Value date*, *Payment due*, *Early payment discount (days)* and *Early payment discount (%)* to set up the following payment conditions:

60 days *value date*, 30 days *net* (payment due), *10* days with a *2* % *early payment discount*

Explanation: The customer receives a 2% discount if he or she pays within 10 days. The payment is late after a total of 91 days. When incoming payments are imported and assigned, they will automatically be checked internally to see whether the customer's early payment discount is valid. If the early payment discount time period has expired, then the order will receive the status *Partial payment received*. The terms of payment listed above will automatically be applied to the order and e.g. to the <<order-processing/orders/order-documents/generating-invoices#, invoice>> and can be changed within the order as well. When the invoice is printed, these terms will be combined into valid payment conditions for this order. The value date and payment due date are added together to create one date when the payment is due. Despite the value date and payment due date being added together, the following is displayed on an invoice:Payment conditions: +
Payment conditions Value date in 60 days, 2% early payment discount if paid within 10 days. Within 30 days due net. If a value for *Value date* is saved for a customer, then this value is used for the document. Otherwise, the value saved under *Payment due* or the value from the customer class is used. The last possibility is to use the number of days entered for the *Payment due* option for the document. These are set up in the <<order-processing/orders/order-documents/#130, Optional elements in the stock unit table>> section. Important: These options are only applied to the total gross value of an invoice.

In the *Filter* tab, you can search for customers according to specific criteria. The customer data that was found will then be displayed in the *Customers* tab. You can edit the customer data. You are provided with extensive settings for doing so as well as links to important menus such as <<crm/managing-customer-data#2000, Orders>>, <<crm/managing-customer-data#2200, Tickets>>, <<crm/managing-customer-data#2400, Statistics>> etc.

In order to search for specific customers, enter a search term in the search fields or select the appropriate drop-down menu settings. You can enter multiple search terms into the search fields at one time. This makes your search run quicker and be more accurate. For example, you could enter the name of a company and a postcode if you are looking for all of the customers who are associated with a particular branch of a company.

You can use the filter settings to define exactly which customer or customer group should be displayed. For example, you could only list customers who are assigned to a specific customer class and have a specific owner. Or you could leave the default settings as they are and search for all customers. If several options are listed in a drop-down menu, then *ALL* will be selected by default.

==== Maintaining bank details

You can save the customer's bank details in the *Bank details* tab of a customer's data record. You can also delete the bank details if you no longer need them.

[IMPORTANT]
.Pay attention to subscription orders
====
Note that the bank details saved here will also be used for subscription orders with the payment method *Debit*. If you delete bank details that are connected to such a subscription order, then the payment method in the <<order-processing/orders/scheduler#, scheduler>> will be changed to the <<omni-channel/online-store/setting-up-clients/order-process#, default payment method>> for the client (store). The subscription order will then no longer be paid for as an automatic bank transfer. In such a case, only delete the bank details if absolutely necessary. If possible, save new bank details for the customer.
