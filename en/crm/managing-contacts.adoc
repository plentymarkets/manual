This page of the manual describes all settings that are available in the *CRM » Contacts* menu as well as the settings that are carried out in the *Setup » CRM* menu.

Go to *Setup » CRM* to carry out preparatory settings such as creating customer classes and types. Go to *CRM » Contacts* to create and edit data records for your contacts and manage all relevant information there such as addresses, orders, scheduled orders, tickets, notes, account balance, bank details and documents.

[#10]
== Carrying out the preparatory settings

Go to *Setup » CRM* to carry out the preparatory settings such as creating <<crm/managing-contacts#15, customer classes>> and <<crm/managing-contacts#20, types>>. Furthermore, you set up <<crm/managing-contacts#25, discounts>> for your customers.

[#13]
=== Setting up the address layout for delivery notes

In the *Setup » CRM » Address layout* menu, you can individually set up address layouts for your countries of delivery for the order document *Delivery note*. The address layouts for the countries of delivery German, France and the United Kingdom are already available in your plentymarkets system by default. You can edit these 3 address layouts if you have the corresponding rights to do this.

[.subhead]
Assigning user rights for back end users

Users of the type *Back end* can only access limited areas and menus in the plentymarkets back end. Thus, their access to the system is limited. If users of this type should be able to see and edit address layouts, a user of the type *Admin* has to assign at least the rights listed in <<#table-rights-address-layout>> to those users.

[.instruction]
Assigning user rights for back end users:

. Go to *Setup » Settings » User » Rights » User*.
. Use the search function (icon:search[role="blue"]) and open the user account that should be edited.
. In the *Authorisations* area, activate the rights as listed in <<#table-rights-address-layout>>.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

|Select one country or multiple countries from the list to which the address layout should apply.

| *Layout* / +
*Fields*
|Drag the address fields from the *Fields* area to the *Layout* area. By doing so, you individually design the address layout for each country. +
*_Tip:_* It is possible to add further rows (maximum number of rows:{nbsp}6) and to remove individual fields and complete rows. Blank rows can also be used. The number of fields per row is not limited.

|====

In order that the address layouts are automatically displayed on delivery notes, you have to carry out a setting in the delivery note. Your plentymarkets system automatically checks the country of delivery saved in the order and displays the delivery note in the layout listed in the *Setup » CRM » Address layout* menu. Proceed as described below.

. Go to *Setup » Client* » _Select client_ » *Locations* » _Select location_ » *Documents » Delivery note*.
. Activate the option *New address layout* in the *Basic settings:{nbsp}Delivery note* area. +
→ The option above *Structure of the invoice/delivery address* is hidden and the delivery notes are displayed in the address layouts listed in the *Setup » CRM » Address layout* menu.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

How to create delivery notes is described on the <<orders/order-documents/generating-delivery-notes#, Generating delivery notes>> page of the manual.

Currently, this setting is only available for delivery notes. This setting will follow for further documents.

[#15]
=== Creating a customer class

Use customer classes to categorise your customer base according to specific criteria. For example, you can create a customer class for consumers (B2C) that displays gross prices for the items in your online store. For sellers (B2B), you create another customer class that displays net prices for the items in your online store. Further options are discounts based on the net value of your items, discounts based on the payment method or discount scales for a selected customer class.

Create customer classes in the *Setup » CRM » Customer classes* menu. The customer classes that you created in this menu are available in the contact data records in the *CRM » Contacts* menu.

[TIP]
.Tip: Create types and classes
====
It is recommended to create a concept for organising your customer base into types and classes before saving customer data. By doing this, you will save time later on. For example, types and classes are automatically assigned when the initial configuration is missing. Decide which types and classes you need, create them and assign them to the customers.
====

You can create and individually configure as many customer classes as you like. An ID is automatically assigned to customer classes. This ID is displayed to the left of the customer classes' name in the overview. However, customer classes are not ordered by ID. Instead, the order is set using the option *Position*.

If a new customer class is created, the customer class is available in the detail view of the contact in the *CRM » Contacts* » _Open contact_ menu.

[.instruction]
Creating a customer class:

. Go to *Setup » CRM » Customer classes*.
. Click on the *New customer class* tab.
. Carry out the settings. Pay attention to the information given in <<#table-create-customer-class>>.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

[[table-create-customer-class]]
.Creating a customer class
[cols="1,3"]
|====
|Setting |Explanation

| *Minimum order quantity*
|Enter the minimum order quantity if you want to require customers to order a specific quantity of items or if you want to require them to order a minimum quantity to get a discount.

| *Name*
|Enter a name for the new customer class, e.g. *wholesaler* or *premium customer*.

| *Position*
|If you do not enter a position, the next available position number is assigned automatically. The position is primarily used to sort the customer classes in the menu. It is relevant e.g. in combination with the visibility of item prices in the online store. This can be set under *Display of the prices in the online store*.

| *Payment due date*
|Enter a payment due date in days for this customer class. If a payment due date is also saved for a contact in the contact data record, it has priority over the payment due date saved here. The payment due date can also be saved as an optional field on <<order-processing/orders/order-documents#, order documents>> such as <<orders/order-documents/generating-invoices#, invoices>>. The invoice's payment due date would be used if no other payment due date was saved in the contact data record or the customer class. Pay attention to the expandable box *Example:{nbsp}terms of payment* below <<#table-create-contact>> in the <<crm/managing-contacts#100, Creating a contact>> menu.

| *Customer ID*
|Specify the customer who is to receive the multi-invoices that are created from <<orders/managing-orders#800#, multi-orders>>. Simply enter the customer ID. Multi-orders are generated for this customer class and the invoice is sent to that customer.

| *Discount type*
|Select a discount type. The number of options that are visible depends on which discount type was selected. If you do no want to offer a discount, select the option *No discount*. Further information and explanations about the discount types in plentymarkets can be found in the <<crm/managing-contacts#25, Using the discount system>> chapter.

| *Volume discount*
|Select whether the value entered in the *Setup » Item » Sales prices* menu under *Minimum quantity* should be taken into account or not.

| *Allowed payment methods*
|Select which of the payment methods that are available in the online store should be permitted for this customer class. +
All of the available payment methods are selected by default. When you integrate new payment methods, you have to permit them here. This is because new payment methods are not automatically included in this list. +
*_Important:_* Pay attention to which <<fulfilment/preparing-the-shipment#1000, payment methods are blocked in the shipping profiles>> that you want to use for this customer class. Check those settings to make sure that they are compatible with the settings you make here. If you want to permit a payment method for a customer class, you should make sure it is not blocked in the shipping profiles. Make sure that the corresponding customer class is not blocked either.

| *Payment instruction*
|The payment instructions that are saved here are displayed on invoices. For example, you could enter payment information that relates to a specific customer class.

| *Display of the prices in the online store*
|Select whether *gross* or *net* prices are displayed in the online store. +
*_Important:_* This option only sets how prices are displayed. It does not influence the way prices are calculated for the customer class. This option is particularly important for the customer class with position 1. This customer class is automatically assigned to customers if no customer class was selected in the contact data record.
|====

You can link sales prices with customer classes. Go to *Setup » Items » Sales prices* and select one of the customer classes that you created under the setting *Class*. For further information, refer to the <<item/settings/prices#100, Sales prices and price calculation>> page.

[#20]
=== Creating a type

Types are used to classify and differentiate contacts. Some types are available by default in your plentymarkets system and cannot be deleted. These types are *Customer*, *Sales representative*, *Supplier*, *Partners*, *Manufacturer* and *Interested party*. The types that you created are available in the *Filter* area in the *Type* drop-down list in the *CRM » Contacts* menu.

When creating a new contact data record, the type *Customer* is automatically set by default. Customers who were assigned to the type *Supplier* are available to select in certain drop-down lists, e.g. in a variation's *Supplier* tab.

Proceed as described below to create types.

[.instruction]
Creating a type:

. Go to *Setup » CRM » Types*.
. Click on *Add type*.
. Enter a name.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

=== Using the discount system

In plentymarkets, you have various possibilities for offering discounts. You may give your customers a <<crm/managing-contacts#26, customer class discount>>, a <<crm/managing-contacts#28, discount based on the method of payment>> or a <<crm/managing-contacts#27, discount scale based on the net value of items>>. Furthermore, you can <<crm/managing-contacts#29, save sales prices as discounts>> and <<crm/managing-contacts#30, manually enter discounts>>. Go to *Setup » CRM » Customer classes* to carry out the settings for the types of discounts. The following sub-chapters describe which settings you need to carry out in order to give discounts.

[#26]
==== Setting up a customer class discount

In a customer class, you determine discounts that are only effective for this customer class. Furthermore, you have further configuration possibilities, such as activating the sales price's volume discount. Make sure that the discounts can be added for each configuration.

[.instruction]
Setting up a customer class discount:

. Go to *Setup » CRM » Customer classes*.

[#27]
==== Setting up a discount scale based on the net value of items

If you would like to reward your customers with discounts when they make large purchases in your online store, you can determine amounts that should be discounted based on the net value of items in the order.

[.instruction]
Setting up a discount scale based on the net value of items:

. Go to *Setup » CRM » Customer classes*.

. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

You find information about how to create customer classes in the <<crm/managing-contacts#15, Creating a customer class>> chapter.

[.subhead]
What the customer sees when making a purchase

The discount is calculated and displayed once the customer has finished putting items into their shopping cart and has gone to the checkout. Initially, only the total discount is displayed in the shopping cart. When the customer completes the order and clicks on Go to cashier, the discount is calculated for the individual variations in addition to the total discount and displayed accordingly.

[#28]
==== Setting up a discount based on the method of payment

The discount type *Discount based on the method of payment* is a sort of early payment discount in plentymarkets. You offer customers a discount if they use one or more payment methods.

[TIP]
.Directly saving a discount based on the method of payment
====
Instead of configuring the settings in this menu, it is also possible to directly save a global discount for a payment method. An example is a discount in percent for the payment method *Cash in advance*. For further information, refer to the <<payment/managing-payment-methods#20, Managing payment methods>> page of the manual. You are not able to completely customise the settings if you save a discount directly for a payment method. It is only possible to completely customise the settings when using the option *Discount based on the method of payment* in the *Setup » CRM » Customer classes* menu.
====

Proceed as described below to set up a discount based on one or more payment methods.

[.instruction]
Setting up a discount based on the method of payment:

You find information about how to create customer classes in the <<crm/managing-contacts#15, Creating a customer class>> chapter.

[#29]
==== Saving sales prices as discounts

A volume-related discount is created as own price in the *Setup » Item » Sales prices* menu. Using the option *Minimum quantity* in the *Settings* area, you specify for the sales price from which item quantity the discounted price should be valid. You can realise graduated prices by creating multiple sales prices accordingly and entering the desired minimum quantities.

The discounted sales price is activated once you set the option *Volume discount* in the customer class to *Include*. A customer receives the discount in case they belong to the customer class and in case they order at least the quantity saved for the sales price.

[.instruction]
Saving sales prices as discounts:

. Go to *Setup » Item » Sales prices*.
. Open the sales price.
. Enter a number in the *Settings* tab in the field *Minimum quantity*. This number determines from which item quantity the discounted price is valid.

.*Example:{nbsp}terms of payment with valuta, payment due date, days for early payment discount and percentage for early payment discount*
--
You can use the options *Valuta*, *Payment due date*, *Days for early payment discount* and *Percentage for early payment discount* to set up the following terms of payment:

60 days valuta, 30 days net (payment due date), 10 days with a 2 % early payment discount

Explanation: The contact receives a 2% discount if they pay within 10 days. The payment is late after a total of 91 days. When incoming payments are imported and assigned, they are automatically checked internally to see whether the contact's early payment discount is valid. If the early payment discount time period has expired, the order receives the status *Partial payment received*. The terms of payment listed above are automatically applied to the order and e.g. to the <<orders/order-documents/generating-invoices#, invoice>> and can be changed within the order as well. When the invoice is printed, these terms are combined into valid terms of payment for this order. The valuta and payment due date are added together to create one date when the payment is due. Despite the valuta and payment due date being added together, the following is displayed on an invoice:

Terms of payment: Valuta 60 days, 2% early payment discount if paid within 10 days. Within 30 days due net. If a value for *Valuta* is saved for a contact, this value is used for the document. Otherwise, the value saved under *Payment due date* or the value from the customer class is used. The last possibility is to use the number of days entered for the *Payment due date* option for the document. These are set up in the <<orders/order-documents#1300, Optional elements in the stock unit table>> area. Important: These options are only applied to the total gross value of an invoice.

=== Duplicate check for contact data records with identical email address

When creating new and updating existing contact data records, the email address is checked in order to avoid duplicate entries in the system.

The logic works in the following way:

* When creating a new contact, the system searches for an existing regular contact with identical private email address. If a contact is found, this contact is updated with the new data. If no contact is found, a new regular contact is created.

* When updating the private email address of an existing regular contact, the system searches if another regular contact with the same private email address exists. If this is the case, the private email address of the current contact is not updated. All other data, however, is updated.

[#450]
=== Exporting the vCard

You can export the data of a contact as business card in VCF format.

[.instruction]
