__Table 2: settings in the **Base** tab__

=== Tab: Item

The **Item** tab is divided into two submenus. In the **Scheduler item** tab, you can see the items that are currently included in the scheduled order. Here you can edit the **quantity**, **price** and other information about the items. The **VAT rates** that are available here depend on the client that was selected in the **Base** tab. You can choose from the VAT rates that were saved for the client under <<client-store/standard/accounting#, **Settings » Client (store) » Standard or other client » Accounting**  >>.

If you change the item description within the **Item description** field, then this change will not go into effect for the actual item itself.

The **Add item** tab displays the **overview of items**. This lets you select from your entire catalog of items.

The **Start** and **End** options are nearly identical to those for the scheduled order (table 2). The only difference is that the duration can be chosen separately for each individual item. This makes it possible, e.g. to offer different items at different times or to offer one item after another in a subscription.

=== Tab: Customer

This tab includes the same menus that are available when you access data for a particular customer within the link::/[**Customers**] menu. Changes that you make here will also go into effect for the particular customer within the **Customers** menu.

== Creating a new subscription

Go to **Orders » Scheduler » Scheduled orders**.

. Click on **New**.
