== Possible uses for coupons

Coupons all have codes which belong to a campaign and which can either be redeemed once or multiple times. Coupons are redeemed during the order process. The discount value is displayed at this time. Coupons can be sent to customers as special offer codes within emails or gift cards can be sold as items in your online store. The buyer then receives the coupon code as a PDF document.

The following overview shows various possibilities for using coupons:

[#15]
== Preparing items for purchase with coupons

Before you begin working with coupons, decide which of your items should be purchasable with a coupon or gift card.

[.instruction]
Allowing items to be purchased with a coupon:

. Go to **Item » Edit item**.
. Open the item that should be purchasable with a coupon.
. Click on the <<item/managing-items#40, **Global**>> tab.
. Set the **Coupon** option to **Permitted**.
. **Save** the settings.  +
→ It will be possible for the customer to purchase this item with a coupon.

Set the **Coupon** option to **Not permitted** if you want to prevent the item from being paid with a coupon. If the customer places such an item in the shopping cart, then the coupon's value will not be applied to this item. It makes sense to prevent some items from being paid for with a coupon, e.g. special offers or other items that should not be discounted further. If you want to make an item available for purchase with a coupon only, then select the setting **Purchasable with coupon only**.

[#20]
== Creating a campaign

Since every coupon belongs to a campaign, such a campaign has to be created first. You can create new campaigns by opening the menu **Orders » Coupons** and clicking on **New campaign**. First, configure the basic options for this campaign in the **Settings** tab and click on **Save**. The campaign will be created and <<orders/coupons#50, **displayed in the overview**>>. Previously created campaigns include two additional tabs: <<orders/coupons#60, **Codes**>> and <<orders/coupons#140, **Templates**>>.

[.instruction]
Creating a campaign:

. Go to **Orders » Coupons**.
. Click on **New campaign**.
. Pay attention to the explanations given in table 2 and carry out the settings as desired.
. **Save** the settings.  +
→ The new campaign will be created and will appear in the overview.

[NOTE]
.Settings are automatically displayed and hidden
====
Settings in this menu will automatically be displayed or hidden depending on the coupon type that is selected. Different settings are required for the <<orders/coupons#22, **coupon types "Coupon" and "Voucher"**>>. Table 2 explains all of the settings.
====

[cols="1,3"]
|====
|Setting |Explanation

2+|Campaign[#21]

|**Name**
|The **title** of the campaign.

|**Description**
|A **description** of the campaign.

|**Concept: Code**
|Select the number of codes from the first drop-down list:  +
**One code** = One coupon code will be generated per campaign which can be redeemed multiple times.  +
**Several codes** = Individual coupon codes will be generated which can only be redeemed once.

|**Concept: Redemptions**
|Select how coupons should be redeemed from the second drop-down list:  +
**Several redemptions per customer** = A customer can redeem the entire coupon amount multiple times.  +
**Caution**: If the coupon is sent to several customers, then they can all redeem the coupon as often as desired. This option can result in high costs to your business once all of the amounts are totaled!  +
**One redemption per customer** = A customer can either redeem the entire coupon amount one time or partial amounts. If the coupon is sent to several customers, then they will all be able to redeem a partial amount as often as desired. However, as soon as one customer has redeemed the entire coupon amount, it will no longer be possible for any other customers to redeem the coupon.  +
**Note**: If customers are not registered, but log in with a guest account, they will be treated as new customers in the system. If the coupon amount is not used up completely, then the coupon can be used several times because one redemption is possible per customer - i.e. new customer, new coupon.  +
**Caution**: All of your customers can simultaneously redeem partial amounts that are below the entire coupon amount. However, once a customer has redeemed the entire coupon amount the coupon will no longer be redeemable. This option can result in high costs to your business once all of the amounts are totaled!  +
**Redemption until the value is depleted** = The coupon can be used until its value has been depleted. If a customer redeems partial amounts, then all of the partial amounts put together may only be as high as the entire coupon amount itself. The coupon can not be redeemed by multiple customers.  +
**One single redemption** = Only one redemption is possible. No further redemptions will be possible, even if only a small, partial amount was used.

|**Use**
|Select **single orders**, <<orders/scheduler#, **subscriptions**>> or both.

|**Minimum order value**
|The minimum order value that needs to be reached in order for the coupon to be redeemed.

2+|Validity

|**Starting date**
|The date when the campaign should be activated.

|**Ending date**
|The date when the campaign should be deactivated.

|**Code validity in weeks**
|Decide how many weeks the coupon codes should remain valid. For example, enter 12 if you want the coupon codes to be valid for 12 weeks. There is a difference between the validity selected here and the starting / ending dates selected above. For example, the validity can be one year (entry: 52) and the campaign can be started and ended as many times as desired throughout the year.

2+|Coupon[#22]

|**Coupon type**
|Select **Coupon** or **Voucher**.  +
The difference here is that **coupons** are redeemed in the online store and **vouchers** are redeemed through third parties. Vouchers are especially popular in the hotel industry where they are simultaneously used as reservations.  +
**Note**: Not all of the options will be displayed if **Voucher** is selected as the coupon type. You will only see the options that are relevant to vouchers.

|**Code assignment**
|Only visible if you selected **Voucher** as the coupon type.  +
Decide whether you would prefer to **Generate new code(s)** or **Use existing code(s)**.

|**Coupon variety**
|Select **Coupon for special offers** or **Gift card**. This determines how coupons are redeemed and displayed in PDF documents.  +
Select **Gift card** for campaigns with coupons that are sold in the online store.  +

**Percentage** = Enter a percentage that should be deducted from the invoice amount. For example, enter 10 if a 10 percent discount should be given on the invoice.  +
**Piece** = Enter a number of items, e.g. 3 items for the price of 2.  +
**Shipping** = Free shipping is applied to the order.

|**Discount value**
|Enter the discount value for the coupon. If you enter a fixed discount value, then select whether the **shipping costs** should be included as well.

2+|Filter

|**Items coming from price comparison portals**
|**Permit** = Coupons are also valid for items coming from <<omni-channel/multi-channel#, **price comparison portals**>>, i.e. items that are offered simultaneously on other markets.  +
**Do not permit** = Coupons can not be used for items coming from price comparison portals (default).

|**Categories**
|Select the categories that the coupon should be redeemable for. If a category is selected, then all of its sub-categories are selected as well. +
By clicking on *Delete* next to the category ID and the category name, the category will be deleted from the campaign. Only the link is deleted, not the category itself.


|**Items**
|Add up to 20 items. This allows you to create coupon campaigns that can only be redeemed for specific items. Enter the item ID in the text field and click on the green plus icon. This creates a new entry in the item list. The list displays the item ID and a delete icon. Repeat these steps as many times as necessary until all of the items have been added.  +
**Link** = Click on the item ID to open the item data record.  +
**Delete icon** = Deletes the item from the list.

|Select a variable for <<crm/sending-emails#, **email templates**>> (see below). The option **No variable** is selected by default. Once a variable has been selected, it can no longer be used for other campaigns.
|====

__Table 2: settings for a new coupon campaign__

[#25]
=== Example for calculating coupons for special offers and gift cards

The **Coupon variety** is selected in the **Coupon** area within the **Settings** tab. The coupon value will be calculated differently depending on which coupon variety is selected. For example, **coupons for special offers** are calculated similarly to discounts.

[TIP]
.Example
====
A customer receives a coupon for €15 and then purchases items in the online store totaling €25 excluding VAT. The customer purchases 2 items. One of the items costs €17.95 and is taxed at a rate of 19% VAT. The other item costs €7.05 and is taxed at a rate of 7% VAT. If the customer uses a **gift card**, then the coupon value will be subtracted from the total including taxes. If the customer uses a **coupon for special offers**, then the coupon value will be subtracted first and then the remaining amount will be taxed.
====

[cols="1,3,3"]
|====
| |Gift card |Coupon for special offers

|**Amount before subtracting the coupon value**
|€28.91 including VAT
|€25 excluding VAT

|**Amount after subtracting the coupon value**
|€13.91 including VAT
|€10 excluding VAT

€11.56 including VAT

|**Remaining amount to be paid by the customer**
|€13.91
|€11.56

The menu <<orders/managing-orders#1300, **Orders » Edit orders**>> also includes a search filter for coupon codes.

[#60]
== Generating coupon codes

The coupon generator is found in the **Codes** tab. There are two ways to generate coupon codes with the coupon generator. They are described below.

[IMPORTANT]
.Valid characters for coupon codes
====
Coupon codes may contain any combination of lower and upper case letters, numbers and the special characters _ and -.

[IMPORTANT]
.More codes than redemptions
====
The number of open coupons can exceed the maximum number of redemptions. As such, there may still be open coupon codes left over once the maximum number of redemptions has been reached. These codes can no longer be redeemed.
====

[#80]
=== Manually entering external coupon codes or coming up with your own codes

Here, you can add your own codes to the list of coupon codes. On the one hand, these can be codes that you received and that were not generated here. On the other hand, these can be individual codes that you came up with on your own.

The data exchange allows you to import large quantities of coupon codes at once rather than to enter them manually one after the other.

[#100]
== Inserting coupon codes directly into emails

Coupon codes can automatically be embedded in emails. When sending an email, a new coupon code will always be generated and sent.
As such, every customer can be sent an automatically generated coupon code with the newsletter as well.  +
The particular campaign first has to be assigned a <<omni-channel/online-store/setting-up-clients/cms-syntax#basics-template-variables, **template variable**>> for this purpose, e.g. **CouponCode1**.

Then, the template variable **$CouponCode1** can be entered into an <<crm/sending-emails#1200, **email template**>>.
A new coupon will automatically be created for the selected campaign every time the email is sent.

[TIP]
.Tip: Note
====
In order for a customer to save a personalized text for a coupon, they will have to click on the **Change** button within the **My account** area of the online store. Inform your customers of this procedure by saving instructions in the item description.

[#160]
=== Automatically sending coupons as PDF attachments

It is useful to send coupons in the form of PDF attachments, e.g. if you offer gift cards or travel vouchers in your online store.

If you sell coupons (gift cards) that you do not want to provide as PDF attachments in the My account area, but would rather send via email, then use an **event procedure** to generate and send the coupons. You need to have an <<crm/sending-emails#1200, **email template**>> that you use for sending the email. Open the template and select the type **Voucher** from the **PDF attachment** drop-down list. The coupon will automatically be attached to the email template as a PDF attachment.
