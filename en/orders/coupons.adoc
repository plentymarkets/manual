Coupons are a great way to simultaneously attract new customers, increase loyalty and generate revenue. plentymarkets has a comprehensive coupon module in the *Orders » Coupons* menu. In this menu, you can create campaigns with various possibilities for discount. Coupons all have codes which belong to a campaign and which can either be redeemed once or multiple times. Coupons are redeemed during the order process. The corresponding discount value is displayed at this time.

[#10]
== Possible uses for coupons

A coupon has a code which belongs to a campaign and which can either be redeemed once or multiple times. Coupons are redeemed during the order process. The discount value is displayed at this time. Coupons can be sent to customers as special offer codes within emails or gift cards can be sold as items in your online store. The customer then receives the coupon code as a PDF document.

The following overview shows various possibilities for using coupons:

.Template variables for displaying voucher codes in email templates
====
When you insert the template variable *$ItemVoucherCodes* in the email template, the codes of a voucher are displayed per order item. The codes are separated by commas. Use the template variable *$VoucherCodes* to display all codes of all vouchers of an order. The codes are separated by commas.

== Preparing items for purchase with coupons

Before you begin working with coupons, decide which of your items should be purchasable with a coupon or gift card.

[.instruction]
Preparing items for purchase with coupons:

. Go to *Item » Edit item*.
. Open the item that should be purchasable with a coupon.
. Click on the <<items/magaging-items#40, Global>> tab.
. Select the setting *Possible* from the drop-down list *Promotional coupon/POS discount*.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.  +
→ It is possible for the customer to purchase this item with a coupon.

[IMPORTANT]
.Do not permit to purchase item with a coupon
====
Go to *Item » Edit item » Open item* and click on the *Global* tab. Set the *Promotional coupon* option to *Not permitted* if you want to prevent the item from being paid with a coupon. If the customer places such an item in the shopping cart, the coupon’s value is not applied to this item. It makes sense to prevent some items from being paid for with a coupon, e.g. special offers or other items that should not be discounted further.

If you want to make an item available for purchase with a coupon only, select the *Purchasable with coupon only* setting.
====

[#20]
== Creating a campaign

Because each coupon belongs to a campaign, you have to create a campaign first. Go to *Orders » Coupons* to create a campaign. Once you have created a campaign, 2 other tabs are displayed apart from the *Settings* tab: <<orders/coupons#60, Codes>> and <<orders/coupons#140, Templates>>.

[[image-create-campaign]]

[.instruction]
Creating a campaign:

. Go to *Orders » Coupons*.
. Click on *New campaign* (icon:plus-square[role="green"]).
. Carry out the settings. Pay attention to the information given in <<table-settings-coupon-campaign>>.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.  +
→ The campaign is created and displayed in the overview.

[WARNING]
.Do not delete campaigns
====
Each coupon belongs to a campaign. To avoid problems with coupons that have already been redeemed, campaigns should not be deleted.
====

[[table-settings-coupon-campaign]]
.Settings for new coupon campaigns
[cols="1,3"]
|====
|Setting |Explanation

2+|*Campaign*

|*Name*
| Enter the name of the campaign.

|*Description*
|Enter the description of the campaign.

|*Concept: Code*
|In the upper drop-down list, select the setting for the codes:  +
*One code* = One coupon code is generated per campaign and can be redeemed multiple times.  +
*Several codes* = Individual coupon codes are generated that can only be redeemed once.

|*Concept: Redemptions*
|In the lower drop-down list, select the setting for the redemption(s):  +
*Several redemptions per customer* = A customer can redeem the entire coupon amount multiple times.  +
*_Important:_* If the coupon is sent to several customers, they can all redeem the coupon as often as desired. This option can result in high costs to your business once all of the amounts are totalled. +
*One redemption per customer* = A customer can either redeem the entire coupon amount once or partial amounts. If the coupon is sent to several customers, they are all able to redeem a partial amount as often as desired. However, as soon as one customer has redeemed the entire coupon amount, it is no longer possible for any other customers to redeem the coupon.  +
*_Note:_* If customers are not registered, but log in with a guest account, they are treated as new customers in the system. If the coupon amount is not used up completely, the coupon can be used several times because one redemption is possible per customer - i.e. new customer, new coupon.  +
*_Important:_* All of your customers can simultaneously redeem partial amounts that are below the entire coupon amount. However, once a customer has redeemed the entire coupon amount the coupon can no longer be redeemed. This option can result in high costs to your business once all of the amounts are totalled. +
*Redemption until value is depleted* = The entire coupon amount can only be redeemed once. If a customer redeems partial amounts, then all of the partial amounts put together may only be as high as the entire coupon amount itself. The coupon can not be redeemed by several customers.  +
*One single redemption* = Only one redemption is possible. No further redemptions are possible, even if only a small, partial amount was used.

|*Use*
|Select *single orders* or <<orders/scheduler#, subscriptions>> or both options.

|*Minimum order value*
| Minimum order value that has to be reached in order that the coupon can be redeemed.

2+|*Validities*

|*Start date*
|The date when the campaign should be activated.

|*End date*
|The date when the campaign should be deactivated.

|*Code validity in weeks*
|Enter the number of weeks that the coupon codes are valid. For example, enter 12 if you want the coupon codes to be valid for 12 weeks. +
*_Important:_* There is a difference between the validity selected here and the options *start date* and *end date* selected above. Be sure not to mix up the validity with the start and end dates. For example, the validity can be one year (entry: 52) and the campaign can be started and ended as many times as desired throughout the year.

2+|*Coupon*

|*Coupon type*
|Select *Coupon* or *Voucher*.  +
The difference here is that *coupons* are redeemed in the online store and *vouchers* are redeemed through third parties. Vouchers are especially popular in the hotel industry where they are simultaneously used as reservations.  +
*_Note:_* Depending on the coupon type selected, different options and settings are visible.
|*Code assignment*
|Only visible if you selected the option *Voucher* as the coupon type.  +
Select whether the coupon codes should be newly generated or existing codes should be used.

*Shipping* = Free shipping is applied to the order.

|*Discount value*
| Enter the discount value for the coupon. +
Activate the option *incl. shipping costs* if the shipping costs should be included in the discount value as well.

2+|*Filter*

|*Items coming from price comparison portals*
|*Allow* = Allow whether coupons can also be redeemed for items coming from <<markets#_using_price_search_engines, price search engines>>, i.e. items that are also offered on other marketplaces.  +
*Do not allow* = Coupons cannot be used for items coming from price comparison portals (default setting). +
*_Note:_* Price comparison portals are all referrers > 1. This means that besides price comparison portals, also marketplaces and platforms are included. The referrers Manuel entry (referrer ID 0) and Online store (referrer ID 1) are not affected by these settings.

|*Categories*
|Add one category or multiple categories (icon:plus-square[role="green"]) for which coupons of the campaign can be redeemed. The sub-categories of a selected category are included automatically. It is also possible to only add sub-categories. +
Click on *Delete* (icon:minus-square[role="red"]) next to the category ID and the category name to remove the category from this campaign and from the list. +

|*Customer types*
| Select the <<crm/managing-contacts#20, customer types>> that are allowed to redeem the coupon. You need to select at least one customer type.

2+|*Email template*

|*Variable*
|Select the template variable for <<crm/sending-emails#, email templates>>. The option *No variable* is pre-selected. +
*_Note:_* Once a variable was selected for a campaign, this variable is no longer available for other campaigns.

[#25.subhead]
Example for calculating coupons for special offers and gift cards

In the *Settings* tab of the campaign, you can select the coupon variety *Promotional coupon* or *Gift card*. The coupon variety that you select determines how the coupon is calculated in the online store. For example, promotional coupons are calculated similarly to discounts.

[TIP]
.Example for calculating coupons for special offers and gift cards
====
A customer receives a coupon for EUR 15.00. The customer purchases items in your online store totalling EUR 25.00 excluding VAT. The customer purchases 2 items. One of the items costs EUR 17.95 and is taxed at a rate of 19% VAT. The other item costs EUR 7.05 and is taxed at a rate of 7% VAT. If the customer uses a *gift card*, the coupon value will be subtracted from the total amount including taxes. If the customer uses a *promotional coupon*, the coupon value will be subtracted first and the remaining amount will be taxed.

====

[#80]
=== Manually entering external coupon codes or coming up with your own codes

[#150]
=== Generating coupons

Customers can buy coupons the same way that they buy normal items. Once your customer has purchased the coupon, they can save the coupon texts for the coupon template.

[TIP]
.Note
====
To save an individual text, the customer has to change the item in the *My account* area of the online store by clicking on *Change*. Write a short note in the description of the coupon item to inform your customers.
====

Once your customer has purchased the coupon, they can edit the coupon text as follows:

[.instruction]
Editing the coupon text in the My account area:

. Log into the online store.
. Open the *Order history* in the *My account* area of the online store.
. Open the order that contains the coupon.
. Click on *Change* next to the item.
. Now a *Recipient*, a *Sender* as well as *Text* can be saved.  +
→ The information that is entered is displayed on the coupon template.

Once the customer has paid for the coupon, the PDF template is made available for download. This can be recognised by the PDF symbol.

By clicking on *Generate PDF*, the PDF document is generated and the customer can print or save the coupon.

[#160]
=== Automatically sending coupons as PDF attachments

It is useful to send coupons in the form of PDF attachments, e.g. if you offer gift cards or travel vouchers in your online store.

If you sell coupons that you do not want to provide as PDF attachments in the My account area, but would rather send via email, use an event procedure to generate and send the coupons. For the email despatch, you need an <<crm/sending-emails#1200, email template>>. In the email template, select the type *Voucher* for the option *PDF attachment*. The coupon is automatically attached to the email template as a PDF attachment.

[TIP]
.Tip: Requirements for sending a coupon with an event procedure
====
In order that coupon codes can be sent via event procedure, a coupon campaign is required. You have to save the campaign for the item in question using a free text field.
====

Each coupon that is sold is displayed as an individual variation on the invoice. To display the sum of redeemed vouchers on invoices, a name has to be entered in the *Coupon amount* field in the layout of the <<orders/order-documents-invoices#, invoice>>.
