|Setting |Explanation

|**Top margin**
|Enter a value (in mm) for the **top margin** on the page. Change the value if needed. For example, change the value if you use a PDF template that contains the company information and logo at the top of the page and you want to position this "header" above the pick list (see section 3 below).

|**Storage location**
|If you use this field, then decide how the **storage location name** should be displayed on the pick list. For example, only the storage location name can be displayed or various combinations of warehouse information can be displayed, such as the rack / shelf / storage location. The quantity is displayed next to the storage location by default. Place a check mark next to the option **Do not show the quantity next to the storage location** if you do not want to display this information on the pick list.

|**Free text**
|Select the name for the free text field. In other words, enter the name that should be displayed on the pick list and select the corresponding **free text field 1-20** from the drop-down menu. +
First, go to **Settings » Item » Free text fields** to create the free text fields. Then link the corresponding items to the free text fields and enter values for the fields. Go to **Item » Edit item » Tab: Fields** to do so. +
For further information, refer to the **<</#, Free text fields >>** and the **<</#, Fields >>** pages of the manual.

|**Item description**
|Decide which information should be included in the item description. The **item name** is always displayed with this field. It is also possible to include additional information, e.g. the **storage location** (see the option above), **item ID**, **external item ID**, **item number**, **EAN** and **order properties**.

== Uploading a PDF template

The term **document template** is used here to describe your store's "letter paper", i.e. a page containing your company information, logo and layout elements according to your corporate design. This template needs to be in PDF format. plentymarkets makes it possible to use a document template for the pick list. In order to upload a PDF template, proceed as described below.

. Click on the **PDF template** tab.
. Click on the **New template** tab.
. Click on **Browse...** and select a PDF document template.

[TIP]
.Tip for the header
====
If you use a PDF template with a header and you want to position this header above the pick list, then you may still need to change the value that was saved as the **top margin** (see the explanation in table 1).
