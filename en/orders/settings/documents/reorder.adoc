== Entering reorder information

Some fields have to be included in the template, e.g. the item quantity and price. Other fields can be displayed on the template if desired, e.g. the storage location, variations and attributes. Some of the information that appears on templates is saved directly in the template settings. Other information is automatically inserted into the template, e.g. customer data. Not only will you learn how to create this document, but you will also learn how to set up a PDF template for displaying the document on your company's own letter paper. Furthermore, you will learn how to use a numbering system.

[IMPORTANT]
.One template for all clients
====
The **reorder** document template can only be set up once per language. This means the same template will be used for all your system's clients.
====

== Setting up reorder documents

This chapter teaches you how to set up the template, how to apply settings from one template to another, how to save a PDF template and how to set up a numbering system.

=== Applying default settings

The **Transfer** tab allows you to apply default settings to your template, i.e. to reset your template to its default values. The tab also allows you to apply your template's settings to another template, e.g. to the delivery note. For example, you may want to give your template the default settings if it does not yet contain any settings. For further information, refer to the **Documents** page of the manual. Specifically, refer to the <<orders/settings/documents#140., **Copying settings** >> chapter.

=== Setting up the template

You have to set up a template before you can print reorders. For further information, refer to the **Documents** page of the manual. Specifically, refer to the <<orders/settings/documents#40., **Configuring document templates** >> chapter.

[IMPORTANT]
.Positioning with coordinates
====
Use **x** and **y coordinates** to position the content within the template. The starting point is the upper left corner of the page.
====

The following table includes explanations of a few important options for configuring the **Reorder** template.

[cols="a,a"]
|====
|Setting |Explanation

|**Print notes for the reorder**
|Select **Yes** if you want any notes that were saved for the order to be displayed on the document. The notes will be displayed in the selected font size. They will appear underneath the table with the item list. Enter a column width to display the columns. Notes are saved in a reorder's **Base** tab. Delete any notes that should not be displayed on the document.

|**Note**
|Enter a note that contains additional information. Such information can be e.g the warehouse that the reorder should be delivered to. Use the template variables to display the address parameters. +
**__Example:__** +
**StorehouseAddress** = Displays the street, house number, postcode and city where the warehouse is located +
**StorehouseName** = Displays the name of the warehouse

=== Applying settings

The **Transfer** tab allows you to copy the settings in the adjustment form's **Template** tab and then apply these settings to a different document, e.g. to a delivery note. For further information, refer to the **Documents** page of the manual. Specifically, refer to the <<orders/settings/documents#140., **Copying settings** >> chapter.

=== Saving PDF templates

Once you have set up the invoice template you can upload a PDF file e.g. with your company logo in the **PDF template** tab. The PDF file has to be on your computer first. For further information, refer to the **Documents** page of the manual. Specifically, refer to the <<orders/settings/documents#170., **PDF template** >> chapter.

=== Creating a numbering system

Use the template's **Numbering** tab to specify how the documents should be numbered. For further information, refer to the **Documents** page of the manual. Specifically, refer to the <<orders/settings/documents#200., **Numbering** >> chapter.

== Generating reorders

Next, check to make sure that the reorder document was correctly configured. Either create a new reorder or use an existing reorder to do so. It is important to check the configuration because some elements are only displayed on the document once there is an actual reorder, e.g. the order notes or the document's number from the **Numbering** tab.

You have different options for creating a reorder. One way is to create reorders in the menu <</#, **Stock » Reorder management » Reorders** >>.
