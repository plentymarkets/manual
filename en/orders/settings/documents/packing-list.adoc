== Packing list

The packing list provides you with an overview of the orders including all of the items that they include. Additionally, the order ID is displayed as a barcode. This way, outgoing items from the order can be booked with the barcode after having been shipped.

== Displaying item data

Use the **Packing list** menu to specify which item data should be included on your packing list, e.g. the item ID, EAN, storage location, etc and how this information should be displayed.

|Enter a value (in mm) for the top margin on the page. Change the value if needed. For example, change the value if you use a PDF template that contains the company information and logo at the top of the page and you want to position this "header" above the packing list (see section 3).

|**How order information texts are displayed**
|Decide which informational texts should be displayed on the packing list. Choose between the options **Customer wishes &amp; Order information texts** and **customer wishes only**.

== Uploading a PDF template

The term document template is used here to describe your store's "letter paper", i.e. a page containing your company information, logo and layout elements according to your corporate design. This template needs to be in PDF format. plentymarkets makes it possible to use a document template for the packing list. In order to upload a PDF template, proceed as described below.
