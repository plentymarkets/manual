== General information about coupons

**Coupons** (gift cards) are a popular way to increase sales and customers accept them gladly especially during the Christmas shopping season. plentymarkets has a comprehensive and sophisticated coupon module. Campaigns can be created with various possibilities for discounts. A coupon is a particular code (string of characters), which belongs to a campaign and which can either be redeemed once or multiple times. Coupons are redeemed during the order process.
