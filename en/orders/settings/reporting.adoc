**Settings &gt; Sales orders &gt; Reporting**

Don't forget to check and save your settings or changes!

==  Reporting

In this menu, you can generate **XML files**, e.g. for data analysis service providers who retrieve these files with the SOAP API.

==  Configuration

XML files will be generated overnight for the areas that were activated (by placing a check mark).

[IMPORTANT]
.
====
If you do not want link::/[**customer data**] such as the **name** to appear in the files that are generated, then you can **make the customer data anonymous**.
====

**Select** the desired areas (place check marks). Decide whether you want to **make the customer data anonymous** and whether you want **existing files in your system to be deleted**. Then click on the **save icon**.
