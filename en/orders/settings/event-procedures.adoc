== Event procedures

Routine tasks make up a significant portion of order processing. To a large extent, you can let your plentymarkets system take care of these for you. In particular, sending E-mails to your customers takes up a lot of time, yet is an essential part of a store that is geared towards service and customers.

With the **event procedures**, plentymarkets provides you with a simple and effective tool for setting up such automatic processes.

The basic principle is easy to understand: Similar to a switch function, certain events in the store trigger specific **procedures**.

[TIP]
.Example: Order confirmation
====
For an order confirmation, the event **New order** is always followed by the procedure **E-mailing**.
====

The __**creation of an event procedure**__ is broken down into the following steps:

. Creating a link:http://orders/settings/event-procedures/new-event-procedure[**new event procedure**, window="_self"]
. Specifying the **event**
. Setting one or more **filters**
. Deciding which **procedures** the system should carry out in this event
. **Activating** the event procedure (placing a check mark)

Event procedures can be used to automate day-to-day processes. For further information, refer to the **<<orders/best-practice/automating-processes#, Automating processes  >>** page of the manual.

== Menu overview

The **event procedures** are found on the left side of the menu. They are sorted into folders according to the type of event. New event procedures are **__automatically sorted__** into the folders. Only those folders that contain at least one event procedure will be displayed. +
For example, all of the event procedures that are triggered by booking the outgoing items will be sorted into the **Outgoing items booked** folder. In image 1, you can see that two event procedures are sorted into this folder. As soon as the outgoing items were booked, the event procedure will automatically send a **shipping confirmation** to the corresponding payment provider.
