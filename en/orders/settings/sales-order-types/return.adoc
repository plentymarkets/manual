[.instruction]
Creating reasons for returns:

. Go to **Settings » Orders » Order types » Return**.
. Enter the desired **reasons** for returns.
. Click on the **save icon** to save the settings.

If you allow customers to **<<client-store/standard/my-account/basic-settings#10., create returns themselves >>** in the "My account" areas of the online store, then customers will be able to choose from the list of reasons here. If a customer does not select any reason, then the first reason will be used by default.

== Status of returned items

You can create up to 12 item statuses. The statuses can then be found in a return's **Overview** tab. They can be selected for each stock unit. Create all of the statuses that you will need. These statuses will then be used to indicate how much progress has been made towards checking, repairing or exchanging the returned item.
