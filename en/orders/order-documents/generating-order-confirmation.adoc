== Automating generating and sending order confirmations

You can set up event procedures to automate generating and sending order confirmations. This way, you don’t have to have an eye on incoming orders at all times and don’t have to generate each order confirmation manually. Instead you can create an easier workflow by automating these events. As a first step, set up an event procedure for generating the document. Then, set up a second event procedure to send the generated order confirmation to your customers. To do so, proceed as follows.

.Setting up an event procedure

. Go to *Setup » Orders » Events*.

[TIP]
.You don’t see the corresponding email template?

You don’t see the corresponding email template for the event procedure "Send order confirmation"? That’s probably because you haven’t created it yet. You can do this in the *Setup » Client » _Select client_ » Email » Templates menu*. Click on *New email template* (icon:plus-square[role="green"]) and create the template according to your requirements. The name you enter here for the email template is then displayed in the event procedures. For further information about setting up email templates, refer to the <<crm/sending-emails#1200, Sending emails>> page of the manual.
