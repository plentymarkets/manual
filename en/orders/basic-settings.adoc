Use the *Setup » Orders » Settings* menu to select which settings should automatically be set for orders and applied under certain conditions and statuses. For example, define the standard settings for the referrer and the status of orders.

[#100]
== Important prerequisites

Standard values are selected by default in new systems. For example, these are status [9] for returns and status [11] for credit notes. These settings can be changed by selecting a different status.  Alternatively, go to *<<orders/managing-orders#1200, Setup » Orders » Status>>* and create a new status. Statuses that are created there are displayed in the *Basic settings* menu and can be selected as standard statuses.

[IMPORTANT]
.Saving the basic settings
====
The basic settings in the *Setup » Orders » Settings* menu have to be saved once when the system is first set up. The settings will not go into effect until they have been saved. Thus, save the settings even if you have not made any changes, i.e. even if you want to use the default settings.
====

[WARNING]
.Important: User login
====
Whenever you carry out changes in this menu and save the settings, other users will be logged out automatically and will need to log in again. This ensures that the changes will also apply to the other user profiles. Therefore, it is recommended that you announce changes to other users of your system in advance.

|Setting |Explanation

|*Standard referrer*
|Select a provider, a market or the *Online store*. This referrer will automatically be set by default for all orders. Select *Manual entry* if you do not want to use a default setting, i.e. if you want to individually save each order referrer.

|*Standard status for return*
|Select which status should automatically be set for *<<orders/managing-orders#400, returns>>*. The status can be changed when creating the return.

|*Standard status for credit note*
|Select which status should automatically be set for *<<orders/managing-orders#500, returns>>*.

|Select which status should be automatically set for reversals. +

Select the status *Last status* if you do not need a specific status. This setting returns the status to what it was before outgoing items were booked.

|*Status of cancelled orders*
|Select the status range for cancelled orders. +
*_Background_*: As soon as an order enters this status range, stock will no longer be reserved for the items included in the order. This means that the stock becomes available for other orders. Statuses can be excluded from this automatic function if necessary. For example, if you do not want item to be reversed if they have a particular status. +
*_Important_*: Save the range of statuses in ascending order, e.g. [8.0] to [8.5].

|*Status for order reservation*
|As soon as an order enters this status, stock is automatically reserved for the items included in the order. You can set up a status up to and including status [6.9]. You can also choose whether the setting should apply to all orders or to paid orders only. For example, select the option *Paid orders only* if stock should not be reserved for unpaid orders.

|*Include shipping costs in warranty*
|*YES* = Customers receive a refund for the shipping costs of a warranty. +

|*Display of item prices*
|Select whether *gross* or *net* prices should be displayed for the items included in the order.

|*Assignment of warehouses*
|Select the method according to which the warehouse is assigned. +

*a) a warehouse can be assigned for each stock unit* = Select this option of you work with multiple warehouses or multiple logistics service providers.

|*Automatic warehouse selection*
|Choose the criterion according to which the warehouse is selected. +
*a) depending on the country of delivery* = The warehouse that was saved for the *country of delivery* in the *Setup » Orders » Shipping » Settings » Tab: Countries of delivery*. +
*_Tip:_* If you select this option, make sure to check which warehouse is assigned to the respective countries of delivery. +
*b) depending on the item’s main warehouse* = The warehouse saved as the respective item’s main warehouse is selected. +
*_Important:_* If no main warehouse has been saved for an order, the warehouse is selected according to the country of delivery. +
*c) depending on the highest stock level* = The order is assigned to the warehouse with the highest stock for the order item. +
*c) depending on the warehouse priority and the highest stock level* = The order is assigned to a warehouse according to the following criteria. The following information is checked one after another: +
1) The *priority* of the warehouse (option available in the warehouse settings). +
In case of sufficient or identical stock in all warehouses, the warehouse with the highest priority. This first criterion does not consider the actual amount of stock. Rather, it checks whether enough stock is available or not. Thus, a warehouse is not favoured because it has more stock than another, but rather because it has a higher priority. Conversely, if a warehouse does not have sufficient stock, it will not be selected.
2) Sufficient stock has to be available. +
*e) depending on the lowest stock level* = The order is assigned to the warehouse with the lowest stock level for the order item. +
*f) depending on the warehouse priority and the lowest stock level* = The order is assigned to a warehouse according to the following criteria. The following information is checked one after another: +
1) The *priority* of the warehouse (option available in the warehouse settings). +

Rather, it checks whether enough stock is available or not. Thus, a warehouse is not favoured because it has more stock than another, but rather because it has a higher priority. Conversely, if a warehouse does not have sufficient stock, it will not be selected.
2) The warehouse with the lowest stock level is selected. +

|*Deposit payment on production items*
|Select a value (in percent) for the deposit or select the option *do not offer deposit*.

|*Status changes to [4] instead of [5] if stock is missing*
|Set this option to *YES* if an order should only be cleared for shipping when there is enough stock in the warehouse. As soon as enough stock has been booked into the warehouse, the *<<orders/managing-orders#1200, order status>>* is changed from *[4]* to *[5]*. +
*Status [4]* = In preparation for shipping +
*Status [5]* = Cleared for shipping

|*Affected status section in status [4.x]*
|Place limits on the status section in case you have created individual variations of status [4]. +
Default setting: From *[4] In preparation for shipping* to *[4] In preparation for shipping*.

|*Status [3.2] is also affected*
|*Status [3.2]* indicates that the item is in a waiting position due to outstanding partial payments. The order automatically enters this status instead of status [4] as soon as a partial payment is made. If stock is available, the order changes to status [3.3]. +

Back end users also need to be authorised to create orders of the type *return*, *warranty* and *repair*. For this, back end users have to be authorised to edit these default status of these order types saved in the *System » System setting » Orders » Settings* menu. The authorisations are assigned in the user profile of the back end user in the *<<basics/admin-tasks/manage-users#105, Rights » User » Menu visibilities>>* menu.
