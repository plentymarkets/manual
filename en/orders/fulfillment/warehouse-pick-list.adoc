==  Warehouse pick list

In this menu, you can create a **warehouse pick list** and set a **status change** at the same time. The pick list can be created as a **PDF** file. The difference between the generic pick list and the warehouse pick list is that the latter allows you to see which **sales orders** or **invoices** belong to the particular items. In other words, items can be matched to their orders while they are being picked and then they can be packaged directly afterwards. In contrast to the generic pick list, you are required to select a specific **warehouse** here.

In order to create a warehouse pick list, proceed as explained below.

**Generating a warehouse pick list:**

==  Configuring or changing a warehouse pick list

**Mandatory setting**
====

You have to activate the **sales order ID** and/or the **invoice number**. Select a **position** number to activate these elements. Make sure to select a position number that is not already being used.

The following is an example of a warehouse pick list that contains information about the **sales order ID** and the **invoice**. We recommend that you always activate the **sales order ID**. As you can see in the example, information about the invoice is not always available.
