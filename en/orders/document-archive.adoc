A maximum of 6,000 PDFs can be zipped and exported. If your export fails, the reason may be that the number of PDFs outreaches the maximum of 6,000. Please select a smaller period of time to reduce the number of PDFs. If you have already reduced the period of time to one day all documents for that day will be zipped and exported regardless of the maximum. In other words when you have reached the smallest period of time that can be selected the file maximum will be ignored.
