:description: Get to know how you can create and work with subscriptions in plentymarkets.
:position: 60

:id: EFRPGV6
:author: team-order-payment

Use the subscription module to generate orders that are automatically sent to your customers at preferred intervals you chose. By using the subscription, you do not have to create each order separately because the selected items are automatically and regularly sent to your customers.
Thus, you can create individual subscriptions for customers and configure the settings as required. +
You can conveniently create and edit subscriptions in an own section in the back end of your plentymarkets system.
Orders that were generated by subscriptions are editable in the order overview, just like other orders. In this chapter, we explain how you <<orders/subscription#200, create a subscription>>, how you <<orders/subscription#300, set up and edit a subscription>> and which other options and functions are available to you.

[#100]
== Preparatory settings

You should take note of and decide on some preparatory settings. Having set those, you can work with subscriptions more conveniently. On the one hand, you can select <<orders/subscription#110, default settings>> for subscriptions, so that these settings are preselected when you are creating a new subscription and do not have to be carried out every time. Deciding on those settings beforehand saves time when you create new subscriptions. On the other hand, you have to assign <<orders/subscription#120, user rights>> if users of the type back end are to work with subscriptions as well. The default settings as well as the settings for assigning the required user rights are described in the following two chapters.

Moreover, tables are customisable. This means that you can decide which information is displayed in the table columns. To do so, proceed as follows.

[.instruction]
Customise table:

. Click on *Configure columns* (icon:cog[]). +
→ The window *Configure columns* opens.
. Select which columns are to be displayed.
. Move (icon:drag_sort_handle[set=plenty]) the columns, so that they are displayed in the order you need them.
. Click on *Confirm* to save your settings.

When you have adapted the table, these settings are saved. The table remains editable, you can change it any time.

[#110]
=== Determining default settings

Go to the menu  *Setup » Orders » Order types » Subscription* to decide on default settings for your subscriptions.
Thus, the settings chosen here are preselected for your new subscriptions and can accelerate your workflow if you regularly need the same settings for subscriptions.
However, it is still possible to decide on different settings when creating a new subscription.

[.instruction]
Proceed as described below to carry out the default settings:

. Go to *Setup » Orders » Order types » Subscription*.
. Carry out the settings. Take into account the explanations given in <<table-subscription-default-settings>>.
.  *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

[[table-subscription-default-settings]]

|Settings|Explanation

|[#intable-subscription-automatic-orders]*Automatically generate orders for any due subscriptions.*
|Select whether orders are automatically generated for subscriptions when they are due.
These orders are then integrated in the order overview and can be edited there. Choose this option by placing a check mark. +
_Note_ that orders are _not_ generated automatically and have to be triggered manually when you do not activate this setting.

|[#intable-subscription-default-status]*Default status*
|Select a default status for subscriptions. This status is then preselected for new subscriptions, but can still be adjusted if required. Available are all <<orders/managing-orders/#1220, statuses>> you have created in your plentymarkets system.

|[#intable-subscription-default-interval]*Default interval*
|You can optionally set a default time period at which the items of a subscription are shipped regularly. This interval is then preselected for new subscriptions, but can still be adjusted if required.

|[#intable-subscription-default-owner]*Default owner*
|Select a default owner. Make sure that the allocated owner has the required <<orders/subscription#120, user rights>> for subscriptions. This owner is then preselected for new subscriptions, but can still be adjusted if required.

|[#intable-subscription-default-referrer]*Default referrer*
|Select a default referrer. This referrer is then preselected for new subscriptions, but can still be adjusted if required.

|[#intable-subscription-default-client]*Default client*
|Select a default owner. This client is then preselected for new subscriptions, but can still be adjusted if required.

|====

[.discrete]
==== Subscription run preview

The *Subscription run preview* is also available in the *Setup » Orders » Order types » Subscription* menu.
Click on the button *Subscription run preview* and a new window with an overview of all *Due subscriptions* opens. These are sorted in ascending order by order IDs.
Additionally, the duration of the subscriptions as well as the last and the next run are displayed.

The information which subscriptions are due is retrieved once a day by the system. The *Subscription run preview* does not only offer you an overview and the option to review due subscriptions, you can also trigger due subscriptions immediately.
 When doing this, take into account that _all due subscriptions are triggered at once_. A selection of individual subscriptions is not possible in this overview.
How you can trigger manual runs for individual subscriptions in the detail view of each subscription is explained further below in the chapter  <<orders/subscription#800, Fulfilled orders: Runs>>.

So, when due subscriptions are displayed, click on *Subscription run preview* in the lower right hand corner of the overview to trigger an immediate manual run. Wait a moment after clicking on the button.
The message *Run executed* is displayed after completion. You can see the orders generated by this in the *Order overview* as well as in the section <<orders/subscription#800, Fulfilled orders>> of the detail overview of the corresponding subscription.

[IMPORTANT]
.Using the Subscription run preview
====
Triggering the due subscriptions cannot be reverted. If required, you can cancel the generated orders in the order overview.
====

[#120]
=== Assigning user rights

Users of the type back end can only access limited sections and menus in the plentymarkets back end. Thus, their access to the system is restricted. If users of this type should be able to work with subscriptions, a user of the type Admin has to assign at least the rights listed in <<table-editing-subscriptions-user-rights-back-end>> to those users.
Subscriptions can be edited with these user rights. In order for users to also create new subscriptions, the rights in <<table-creating-subscriptions-user-rights-back-end>>  have to be assigned _additionally_.

[.instruction]
Assigning user rights for back end users:

. Go to *Setup » Settings » User » Rights » User*.
. Use the search function and open the user that should be edited.
. In the  *Authorisations* section, activate the rights as listed in <<table-editing-subscriptions-user-rights-back-end>>.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

Required user rights to see and edit user rights:

== Further areas in the detail view

The detail view of a subscription also offers you the further areas *Fulfilled orders*, *Messenger* as well as the *History*. Access these areas either via the menu on the left or by scrolling down in the detail view.

[#800]
=== Fulfilled orders: Runs

In this section, already fulfilled orders belonging to a subscription are displayed. These orders can be generated by either manual or automatic runs.
*Automatic runs* are regularly carried out at the intervals you selected for the subscription. When the subscription has reached the end date or when it is cancelled, no automatic runs are carried out any more.

Additionally to the automatic runs you can trigger a *manual run*. _Note_ that a manual run is always carried out _immediately_.

[.instruction]
To trigger a manual run, proceed as follows:

. Go to *Fulfilled orders* in the detail view of the subscription for which you want to trigger the manual run.
. Click on *Manual run*.
. You are asked whether you want to skip the next automatic run. +
→ When the next automatic run is executed depends on the selected interval.
. The manual run is executed. +
→ The order generated by this is assigned an *order ID* and is displayed in the section *Fulfilled orders* as well as in the *order overview*.

Other information displayed in the section *Fulfilled orders* are for example the date of the order generation or the selected payment method.
Moreover, you can also delete (icon:minus-square[role="red"]) individual orders of a subscription. When you delete an order here, it will also be deleted from the order overview in the *Edit orders* menu. _Note_ that orders cannot be deleted when tax relevant documents have already been generated.

[WARNING]
.Skipping an automatic run
====
When you chose *Skip the next automatic run* while triggering a manual run, the next automatic run is also skipped when the order generated by the manual run is deleted.

==== Locking and unlocking of subscriptions

After the first order is generated, the subscription is locked and the editing options in the detail view are restricted. Still editable are the end date as well as the date the subscription is cancelled. If the order is deleted, the subscription is unlocked. But note that as soon as tax relevant documents, e.g. an invoice, exist, orders cannot be deleted any more.

Moreover, you can unlock the subscription by clicking in *Unlock* (icon:visibility_private[set=plenty]). All editing options are once more available then. It is documented in the <<orders/subscription#1000, history>> which user executed this step at and the time when it was done. The subscription is locked again by clicking on *Lock* (icon:unlock-alt[role="lightGrey"]). If this is not done the subscription will automatically be locked again after the next run es executed. But it is recommended to lock the subscription again after editing because this too is entered in the history. This way, transparency and traceabilty are ensured.

[#900]
=== Using the messenger

Use the messenger to create notes about your contacts in the back end. Notes are only visible in your plentymarkets back end and cannot be accessed by your contacts.

. Click on *Send* (icon:envelope-o[role="purple"]).

You can open the note either in the *Messenger* section of the subscription detail view or you can view the note in the *Messenger* section of the contact. To see it there, go to the selected contact in the contact overview. You can find a more detailed explanation about the messenger and notes in the <<crm/messenger#, Managing messages with the messenger>> chapter of the manual.

Select whether you want to have the messages sorted in descending or ascending order by choosing the *Sorting* from the drop-down list accordingly.

[#1000]
=== History

The History offers you an overview over the executed steps and functions of a subscription. Included are for example updates of orders or the creation of new orders. These changes are sorted by date in this overview.
The table includes information on when the step was executed, by which owner, what the step was and about the status of the subscription at that time.

[#1100]
== Subscription overview

Go to *Orders » Subscription* to access the subscription overview. Displayed here are all created subscriptions, sorted in ascending order by the order ID.
Additionally, you see the following information in the title rows of each subscription:

* Order ID

* Payment
* Status
* Start
* End
* Cancelled
* Last run

If you want to change the status of a subscription, you can do so directly in the overview. Click on the status and select the required status from the drop-down list.
For any other changes to the subscription, click on the title row of the subscription you want to edit. The detail view opens and you can edit the subscription.
