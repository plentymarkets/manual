== Warranty

Warranties are __**quite similar to returns**__. In both cases, the items of an order in **__status 7__** will be sent back to you. In contrast to a return, your customers expect either a __**new delivery**__ or they want their __**money back**__ (credit note) with a warranty. In case of a warranty, please note that you will usually not book items back in from the ones returned but rather that you will have a second delivery with a separate order ID and overall with its own outgoing items.

The terms **warranty** and **guarantee** are often used interchangeably. Here is how they are used in plentymarkets:

* **Warranty** +
In the plentymarkets system, a warranty is defined as the **seller's** legal obligation to correct deficiencies, which were already present at the time the item was delivered to the customer at no charge for the customer. Warranty regulations are subject to national law. Please read up on regulations and time limits in your country or contact a legal advisor for such information.
* **Guarantee** +
In the plentymarkets system, a guarantee is defined as a voluntary affirmation of the **manufacturer and/or seller** how to proceed if damages or problems should occur. A guarantee is not based on legal specifications but on a contractual agreement between manufacturer/seller and customer. Therefore, regulations and time limits are not subject to legal regulations but are within the discretion of the guarantor.

When a guarantee is given, the seller can decide whether to refund the costs to the customer, repair the item or exchange it for a new one.

If you want to reimburse the item's costs, create a **credit note** in the system. For further information, refer to the **<<orders/editing-sales-orders/credit-note#, Credit note  >>** page of the manual. +

In case of exchange or repair, create a **warranty**. Go to <<orders/settings/basic-settings#, **Settings » Orders » Basic settings**  >> to select whether the **shipping costs** should be covered in the warranty.

[TIP]
.Tip: Warranty settings
====
If you create a warranty directly within an order, the order's **shipping profile** is automatically adopted. However, the settings can be changed in the warranty's editing window. For **delivery orders**, the correct warehouse is automatically selected as well. The **payment method** for a warranty can be changed.

== Creating a warranty

In general, you create a warranty out of a return. However, it is also possible to create it out of the original order.
