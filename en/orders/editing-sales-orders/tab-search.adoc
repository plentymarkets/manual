Orders are retrieved from different referrers and collected in the order overview listed under **Orders » Edit orders**. Here, they are managed using a **<<orders/settings/order-status#, status system  >>**. You can use the order search to list all of your orders or to find very specific orders. Use the filters to search for orders that fulfill specific criteria.

[#10]
== Requirement: User rights

Some orders may not be displayed depending on how the rights were configured for the user. This relates to the **Status**, **Client (store)** and **Warehouse** options that can be restricted in the user configuration. These options are found by clicking on the **Rights** tab and then on the **Visibility** tab. If needed, go to **link::/[Settings » Basic settings » User]** and check the settings for users who work with the order search.

[#20]
== Filter options

The default setting will always display a list of all orders received during the past 2 months because in this setting the different filter options except **Date from to** are set to **ALL**. Change the filter settings to refine your search and to display e.g. orders with a specific status.

Set one or combine several filters to search for orders with specific criteria. To do so, proceed as follows and pay attention to the following example.

[.instruction]
Searching for orders:

. Go to **Orders » Edit orders**.
. Carry out the filter settings as desired.
. Check whether the default setting for the option **Date** and the given time span under **from to** meets your requirements.
. Click on **Search** to display the orders.

[NOTE]
.Resetting the search
====
Click on **Reset** to reset your filter settings to the default settings. Click on **Search** to reset the search result.

__Image 1: searching for orders, filter options and order overview__

[#30]
=== Example settings

If you carry out the settings as displayed in image 2 (see arrows) and click on **Search**, all orders that currently are in status 7 or lower and did not have their outgoing items booked yet will be displayed. The orders listed in the search result are sorted by their **Order ID** (meaning the time the order was created). This setting will yield all orders which still have to be processed.

image::orders/editing-sales-orders/assets/EN-SearchingOrders-02.png[]

__Image 2: searching for orders, example settings__

[#40]
=== Filtering by IDs and numbers

Change the filters' default settings to search for specific orders. One way to find specific orders is to use the search fields (image 3, fields on the left). Enter IDs or numbers into these fields to search for orders, customers or items in your system and to find orders that belong to them. For example, if you enter a **Customer ID**, then you will see the orders that correspond to the customer with this ID.

image::orders/editing-sales-orders/assets/EN-SearchingOrders-03.png[]

__Image 3: searching for orders, searching by an ID__

For example, if you enter the number 3 into the **Order ID** field and click on **Search**, only the order with ID 3 will be displayed in the overview. This way, you can also search for several orders. To do so, enter the **Order IDs** separated by commas (image 3). If you search for an **Order ID**, then all of the other filters for entering information will be grayed out.

Use the operators, e.g. **&gt;** or **&lt;** or use **from** and **to** to specify a range of statuses to be filtered and displayed.

[NOTE]
.Status search filter
====
If you are searching for one or several orders with the help of one of the search fields, you must not forget to set the search option **Status** correctly (image 2, middle). If you are searching for a specific invoice number, then it is recommended that you select **ALL** as the status option, since the order could have already been delivered or could have a status beyond **7**. Hence, it is important not to forget that only orders which match all selected criteria are displayed. If you can not find an order despite having entered the exact ID, you might have forgotten to select **ALL** for the search option **Status**.
====

[#50]
=== Filtering by customer data, item data and invoice numbers

If you are searching for specific customer or item data, then it is recommended that you use the search fields **Customer data** and **Item data** (image 2 or 3). You can enter search terms as well as numbers into these fields. You can use the **Customer data** field to search for customer names and zip codes. However, you can not search for telephone numbers. Search terms entered into the **Item data** field will be searched for in the fields item ID, item number and name. However, the fields containing description texts (short_description, description) will not be browsed. When searching for **Invoice numbers**, you can also search for external invoice numbers.

[NOTE]
.Only shorten search terms and numbers at the end
====
When searching for customer or item data, it is often sufficient to only enter the word stem into the field. In this context, it is important to know that search terms can be shortened to almost any extent at the end of words, but they can not be shortened at the beginning. If you are e.g. searching for items with the search term packages, you could also enter package or pack. Searching for ackages, however, would not yield any results. The same is true for all numbers (e. g. customer numbers, zip codes).
====

[#60]
=== Filtering by order type

Use the **Type** filter in order to search for the following <<orders/settings/sales-order-types#, **order types**  >>:

* **Order**
* **Credit note**
* **Multi credit note**
* **Return**
* **Warranty**
* **Offer**
* **Advance order**
* **Delivery order**
* **Repair**
* **Multi-order** (plentymarkets Enterprise only)
* **Orders, warranties, delivery orders and repairs**
* **Orders and delivery orders**

The search will only be carried out for the order type or combination that was selected. The filter is set to **ALL** by default, i.e. all types of orders will be searched for.

[#70]
=== Filtering by date

Use the **Date** filter to search for orders that went through a certain step during the time selected. Select this step under **Date**, i.e. **Incoming orders**, **Incoming payment** or **Outgoing items**. Use the **from** and **to** fields to select a starting and ending date for the search. All of the orders that went through the selected step within this time period will be displayed. By default, you will search for orders that were received within the last 2 months. For example, if you search for orders on May 15th, then the default time period will be from **March 15th** to **May 15th** and all orders received within this time period will be displayed.

If you do not want to search for orders with the default 2 month setting, then select the desired time period as described below.

image::orders/editing-sales-orders/assets/EN-SearchingOrders-04.png[]

__Image 4: searching for orders, **date filter**__

[.instruction]
Searching orders by date:

. Go to **Orders » Edit orders**.
. Select one of the filter options from the **Date** drop-down menu, e.g. **Order received** (image 4, number 1).
. Use the **from** and **to** fields to select a **starting** and **ending date** for the search (image 4, number 2).
. If needed, select additional filter options as described.
. Click on **Search** to list the orders for the selected time period.

[.instruction]
Setting: Ignore

It is not helpful to select a time period in some situations. Rather, it may make more sense to filter all orders. In these cases, the date filter will automatically switch to the setting **Ignore** as soon as you have entered something into certain search fields. These are:

* Searching by the **Customer ID**
* Searching under **Outgoing items** with the options **Not booked**, **Today** or **Yesterday**
* Searching under **Payment** with the options **Unpaid only**, **Partial payment** or **Unpaid and partially paid**

Reset the setting by deleting the values that were entered or by refreshing the page.

[#80]
=== Filtering by flags

Not only statuses but also flags can be assigned to your orders. You can search for orders in the order overview by these flags. For example, you can assign a certain icon to all orders that you think could be problematic and, therefore, have to be cleared by the person in charge before being shipped. This person could search for flagged orders once a day with the filter **Flag**, enter and save a note for each of them and then reset the flag.

[#90]
=== Filtering by documents

Use the **Document** filter to search for orders for which a <<orders/settings/documents#, **document**  >> of a certain type has already been created. The following two options are available:

Proceed as described below in order to search for all orders with a document of a specific type.

[.instruction]
Searching for orders with a document:

. Go to **Orders » Edit orders**.
. Select a document type from the **Document** drop-down menu in the **Filter** tab, e.g. Invoice.
. Pay attention to the **Date** filter. The default setting only displays orders from the last 2 months. Adjust the filter as needed.
. Click on **Search**. +
→ All orders for which a invoice was created will be displayed in the search result.

You can also search for an order with a document that has a certain number. To do so, proceed as follows.

[.instruction]
Searching for an order with a document with a specific number:

. Go to **Orders » Edit orders**.
. Select a document type from the **Document** drop-down menu in the **Filter** tab, e.g. Delivery note.
. Enter the number of the delivery note into the **Number** field.
. Pay attention to the **Date** filter. The default setting only displays orders from the last 2 months. Adjust the filter as needed.
. Click on **Search**. +
→ Only the order to which the delivery note with the number entered belongs will be displayed in the search result.

[TIP]
.Searching for a document without selecting a document type
====
Searching a document number will also work if you keep the default setting **Document** in the drop-down menu and do not select a specific type. However, if the numbers of different document types are identical, all orders that include a document with this number will be displayed. This could happen e.g. if you do not use automatic numbering.
====

[#100]
=== Filtering by coupon codes

It is possible to search for orders that contain a specific <<orders/coupons#, **coupon code**  >>. This is done by entering the code into the **Coupon code** search field. Then use the drop-down menu to choose between the options **All**, **Redeemed** and **Sold**. **All** is selected by default. Select **Redeemed** if you only want to search for orders containing coupon codes that were redeemed. Select **Sold** if you only want to search for orders containing coupon codes that were sold. Select **All** if you want to search for orders containing coupon codes that were redeemed and orders containing coupon codes that were sold. The search filter only works if a coupon code is entered. This is true even if you select the setting **All**. In other words, you can not use the search filter simply to find all orders that contain coupons.

[#110]
== Setting up the order overview

The following tools help you to easily keep track of and manage the search results:

[#120]
=== Page overview

You can specify how many orders will be displayed per page in the order overview. You can select different amounts between 50 and 400.

image::orders/editing-sales-orders/assets/EN-SearchingOrders-05.png[]

__Image 5: selecting the number of orders per page__

Use the blue arrows to switch between pages. If the order overview consists of several pages, the quickest way to switch to a specific page is to enter the page number and press **Enter**.

image::orders/editing-sales-orders/assets/EN-SearchingOrders-06.png[]

__Image 6: switching to a different page__

[#130]
=== Item list in the order overview

The individual stock units of an order will be displayed in the order overview if the option **Show** was selected for the search filter **Stock unit** (default). This way, the items included in an order and their most important parameters, e.g. **name**, **size** and **price** will be immediately available to you.

image::orders/editing-sales-orders/assets/EN-SearchingOrders-07.png[]

__Image 7: searching for orders, the item list is open__

[NOTE]
.Opening and closing the item list
====
Click on the blue arrow (image 7, red arrow) to display or hide the item list.
====

If the overview contains many orders with long lists of items, then you may find it difficult to scroll through the orders and access the information that you are looking for. That's why there is an option to close the item lists for all orders at once. When doing so, make sure that you do not change the other filters for the orders that are displayed. This will ensure that you get the same search results.

[.instruction]
Globally closing item lists in the order overview:

. Go to **Orders » Edit orders**.
. In the **Filter** tab, select **Do not show** for the option **Stock unit**.
. Click on **Search**. +
→ The item lists will close for all orders displayed.

[#140]
== Information and icons in the order overview

Different icons will be displayed in the order overview depending on the order's condition. This will be explained further below.

image::orders/editing-sales-orders/assets/EN-SearchingOrders-08.png[]

__Image 8: information in the order overview__

You can see quick information about an order by looking at its title in the overview. You can see the <<orders/settings/order-status#, **status**  >> and logos that show the link::/[**shipping service provider**] and the link::/[**payment method**] (image 8, arrow). You may see other icons there as well depending on the configuration and the procedures that were carried out.

image::orders/editing-sales-orders/assets/EN-SearchingOrders-09.png[]

__Image 9: different icons in the order overview__

The **Book outgoing items** icon will disappear once this procedure has been carried out. It will be replaced with the **Outgoing items booked** icon (image 9, green arrow). At the same time, the status will change to 7 (image 9, blue arrow). The status background colors make it possible to immediately recognize which orders are in the same status.

The following table gives an overview of the informational icons that display the condition of each order in the overview. The icons will only be displayed if corresponding settings or entries were saved.

|**DHL Packstation** +
The icon will only be displayed if the Packstation data is correct in the order. The Packstation data may not be correct for orders that were retrieved from markets. This could be the case, for example, if the market does not validate the address. In such a case, the icon will not be displayed. Due to the incorrect data, it is not possible to deliver to a Packstation.

== Functions in the order overview

The following section provides you with details about the functions that can be carried out within the order overview.

[#160]
=== Placing a reorder in the order overview

You can create a **reorder** by clicking on the calculate stock icon.

image::orders/editing-sales-orders/assets/EN-SearchingOrders-11.png[]

__Image 11: creating a reorder in the order overview__

In order to create a reorder, a supplier has to be saved for the **item**.

[.instruction]
Placing a reorder in the order overview:

. Go to **Orders » Edit orders**.
. Open the desired order and click on the **Calculate stock** icon in the order overview (image 11, number 1).
. Click on the **shopping cart** icon in the **stock** area (image 11, number 2). +
→ A separate window will open for **creating a reorder**.  +
→ If you receive an error message telling you that no **supplier** is linked to this item, then please link a supplier to the item first.
. Enter your desired **quantity** for the reorder into the text field on the left (image 11, number 3).
. Select the **supplier** from the drop-down menu (image 11, number 4).
. Activate the option **Register an order-based reorder** if the reorder is to be added to this order.
. **Save** the settings. +
→ The reorder will be created.

[#170]
=== Group functions

plentymarkets provides various tools to process and manage orders as efficiently as possible. The group function described below is one of them. Using this group function, you can edit one or more orders at the same time and avoid time-consuming manual input. That way, you also minimize the risk of possible input errors.

The following example underlines the possibilities you have with the group functions: A popular item from your store is temporarily unavailable. However, there are already numerous orders for it. In most cases, sellers are powerless in case of supply delays. However, they have to inform the affected customers as quickly as possible. Especially customers who have paid in advance will have little patience.

With the group function, this job can be done easily: You simply use the **item ID** or **item name** to search, and select the status filter **ALL &lt; 7** because this procedure is only relevant for orders which have not been shipped yet (=outgoing item not yet recorded). When all orders are listed, go to **Group function** and select the option **Email service** to inform all your customers. As soon as you have selected a group function here, specific settings will appear next to the menu (image 12).

image::orders/editing-sales-orders/assets/EN-SearchingOrders-12.png[]

__Image 12: searching for orders, group functions__

In our example, the customer is the recipient. You must have created an **link::/[Email template]** in advance. It is not compulsory to set a **flag**, but this can make sense (image 12, arrow for number 2). Before you carry out the group function by clicking on **Apply** (image 12, number 3), make sure that you have selected all of the desired orders with a check mark (image 12, number 1).

[TIP]
.Status &gt;= 7
====
If the **order status &gt;= 7**, then you can not lower this status until you have reset the outgoing items that were booked. First use a group function to reset the **outgoing items** for orders that have a status of 7 or higher.
