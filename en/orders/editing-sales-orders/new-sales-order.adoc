== General information about creating new orders

An **order** is **__automatically__** created in plentymarkets whenever a customer orders something in your online store. However, you can also create orders **__manually__**. This is a useful function for orders coming in by telephone or directly in your local store. It was developed to enable you to process all incoming orders no matter where they are from. Here you will learn how to create orders manually.

[IMPORTANT]
.Default settings for editing orders (variable user)
====
In order for __**variable users**__ to be able to open orders, go to <<orders/settings/basic-settings#, **Settings » Orders » Basic settings**  >> and save default statuses for **returns** and **credit notes**. No status is saved here as the default setting.

Variable users also need to be given the right to create and edit orders. Go to **Settings » Basic settings » User » Accounts** and open the particular user profile. Then click on link::/[**Tab: Right » Tab: Menu » Area: Orders**].

Giving variable users the right to standard statuses

Variable users can only create **returns**, **warranties** and **repairs** if they are also authorized to work with the standard statuses that are saved for these types of orders under <<orders/settings/basic-settings#, **Settings » Orders » Basic settings**  >>. Variable users are given the right to work with statuses in their **user profile** under **link::/[Tab: Right » Tab: Visibility]**.
