If you want to create a credit note for an existing order, you first have to open this **order** in the corresponding menu.

[.instruction]
Searching for an order:

. Search for the respective order by entering an **ID** or customer data into one of the order search fields.
. Afterwards, open the order by clicking on it in the overview. +
→ The order will open in a separate tab (image 1).

By selecting the option **Credit note: create** in the **Overview** tab (image 1), a new credit note order will be created in plentymarkets. You have now created a special order, which is linked to the original order and includes all items and prices.

In the **Edit** tab, you can change the options for the items in the credit note or you can remove items from those listed. For example, you can change the **quantity** of an item in the credit note. You can recognize options that can be changed by their text fields, drop-down menus or text links. On the right-hand side, you will also find the icons **Stock** and **Create reorder**. The **Delete** icon removes the item from the credit note.
