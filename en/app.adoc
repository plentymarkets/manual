== How do you set it up?

[#300]
=== Download the app and install it on the appropriate hardware

What do you want to use the app for? <<app/installation#100, Which hardware you need>> depends on what you want to do with the app. For example, if you want to scan barcodes and accept credit card payments, then you’ll need more hardware than if you only want to track sales figures.

Decide which hardware is right for you and download the app on these devices.
