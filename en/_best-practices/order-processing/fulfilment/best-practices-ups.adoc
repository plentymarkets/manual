In the following sub-chapters, you will find error messages that are sent back from UPS to plentymarkets via the interface, as well as possible solutions.

You can retrieve the registration data and the response with possible error messages for a duration of two weeks in the *Data » API Log » Tab: Shipping centre API log* menu. Click on *Open request log* in the right column to open a window that displays the registration data. Click on *Open response log* to open a window with the response message from UPS.

[#100]
== No order data available

This error message indicates that the shipping service provider and/or the shipping profile at the order does not correspond to the registered order. For example, you changed the shipping service provider in the order, but selected an inappropriate shipping profile.

Screenshot from the test system:

Another reason is that the standard shipping profile has been saved in the order because no valid shipping profile was found. When editing the shipping profile, the message 'Kein Wert gefunden' ('No value found') would be displayed.

[#200]
== 120110 (Hard): Missing or invalid Shipper AttentionName oder 120101 (Hard): Missing or invalid Shipper Name

Like the other shipping service providers, UPS requires shipper data. However, this data must not be saved in the settings of the shipping service provider itself, but in the *System » Orders » Shipping » Service provider » Settings* menu for the required warehouses.

*Shipper AttentionName* is the contact person, *ShipperName* is the company name.

[#300]
== 120209 (Hard): Missing or invalid Ship to phone number

The telephone number of the recipient is mandatory for international shipping. However, the interface requires also a telephone number for national shipping inside Germany, even though the UPS back end does not.

[#400]
== 120109 (Hard): Missing or invalid shipper phone number

The telephone number of the shipper must not be missing. It is most likely that the required field for the warehouse that you selected for the order in the *System » Orders » Shipping » Service providers » Settings*  menu is not filled in. Go to this menu and fill in the field. Please note that this might be the "first" message we receive from UPS. It might be possible that further fields will be checked. The fields for company and contact person must be filled as well as described above for error messages <<_best-practices/order-processing/fulfilment/best-practices-ups#200, 120110 and 1202101>>.

[#500]
== 120500 (Hard): Missing or invalid service code

When this error message is displayed, you should check the table of shipping charges of the shipping profile. The service cannot be transferred if the table of shipping charges of a region was not saved. This can be recognised by the following note:

`Region wird im Versandprofil nicht verwendet. Preis eintragen und speichern, um Region zu verwenden. Portotabelle speichern und neu laden, um Versanddienstleister-Einstellungen anzulegen.`

`EN-Version`

[#600]
== 120124 (Hard) : The requested service is unavailable between the selected locations

This error message will be displayed if the selected UPS service in the table of shipping charges is not allowed for the countries of shipper and recipient. The first value for *UPS Services* will be selected as standard when saving the table of shipping charges. This value may not necessarily permitted for certain country combinations. Please contact UPS and ask which country combinations are valid.

[#700]
== 120122 (Hard): Invalid Shipper ShipperNumber

This error message will be displayed for the following two reasons:

* The customer number saved in the *System » Orders » Shipping » Service provider » UPS* menu is incorrect.
* The customer number saved in the *System » Orders » Shipping » Service provider » UPS* menu has not yet been verified by UPS.

[#800]
== Code 1 : Der Vorgang konnte nicht korrekt durchgeführt werden. Bitte Dateneingabe prüfen. 10001: The XML document is not well formed

This error message will be displayed when there is an error in the data to be transferred to UPS. This error makes the file "not valid".

For example, it is possible that the direct login to UPS is working, but the interface, however, is acting more strictly. It could be the case that special characters and/or umlauts were saved in the user name or password. This must be adjusted accordingly in the plentymarkets back end. After having saved the login data, try to register the order again.
