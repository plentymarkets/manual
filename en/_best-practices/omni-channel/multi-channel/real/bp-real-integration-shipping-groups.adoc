== Real.de: Integration of shipping groups

=== What is the use of shipping groups?

On real.de, shipping groups are set up in the *Händlereinstellungen » Versandeinstellungen* [Seller settings » Shipping settings] section. With shipping groups, shipping costs can be based on the country of delivery.

=== How to carry out the settings on real.de

Go to the section *Händlereinstellungen » Versandeinstellungen*.

=== How to carry out the settings in plentymarkets

Select the client and go to *System » Markets » real.de » Settings*.

=== Which settings to carry out in plentymarkets

You have to carry out two settings in the *Match shipping profiles* section.

. Download the shipping groups from real.de by clicking on *Update shipping groups*.
. The shipping profiles which are released for real.de are listed on the left-hand side. On the right-hand side, you can select and match a real.de shipping group from the drop-down list.

Only the shipping groups which are released for real.de are displayed. You can release shipping groups in the corresponding shipping profile in the menu *System » Orders » Shipping » Settings » Tab: Shipping profiles* by activating the order referrer.

=== Step 1

Set up the *shipping groups* in the *Händlereinstellungen » Versandeinstellungen* section at *real.de*.

=== Step 2

Import the real.de shipping groups in the *System » Markets » real.de » Settings* menu in plentymarkets. To do so, click on *Update shipping groups* in the section *Match shipping profiles*.

=== Step 3

Match the real.de shipping groups with the desired plentymarkets shipping groups in the *System » Markets » real.de » Settings* menu.

=== Which shipping profile is matched?

If an item is linked to several shipping profiles with different shipping groups, then the shipping group of the shipping profile with the lowest category and the highest priority is assigned.
The category and the priority of the shipping profile is set up in the *System » Orders » Shipping » Settings » Tab: Shipping profiles* in the *Base* tab of each shipping profile.

=== How to set up shipping profiles

If you only have a few shipping profiles and a simple structure, you do not need to carry out any particular settings.
If you have to reproduce a complex structure with the shipping profiles, then you should create separate shipping profiles for the snychronisation of the shipping groups. Those shipping profiles should only be released for real.de. Additionally, you should not release any other shipping profiles for real.de. This may initially be a lot of work, but you will have a clear structure which facilitates any further tasks afterwards.
Use the data format *ItemParcelServicePreset* to add the shipping profiles to your items afterwards. To use the data format *ItemParcelServicePreset*, the link:https://marketplace.plentymarkets.com/en/plugins/integration/ElasticExportShippingProfiles_4747[plentymarkets shipping profiles^] plugin must be installed. The data format *ItemParcelServicePreset* is available in the *Data » Custom export* menu.
