== Issue

In plentymarkets 7 the old exports, which were set up in plentymarkets version 6, do not function properly any more.
A new Elastic export has to be created as a substitute.

== Instructions
=== Step 1


Get the plugins *Elastic export* and *RakutenDE* on the link:https://marketplace.plentymarkets.com/en/[Marketplace] for 0.00 EUR. Log in with the same access data that you also use for the Service Center. If you do not know your access data, go to **Start » plentymarkets account » Service Center** to view your email address and your password.

=== Step 2

Install the plugins with these instructions.

=== Step 3

Create an Elastic export for each account on Rakuten.de. To create an Elastic export, go to **Data exchange » Elastic export**.
link:https://forum.plentymarkets.com/t/faq-elastischer-export-wie-installiere-ich-ein-plugin-ein-update-fuer-ein-plugin/46271[Wie installiere ich ein Plugin] (Please note that these instructions are currently only available in German.)

The following settings should be applied to replicate the old logic:

. Settings

* * Format:* RakutenDE-plugin
* *File name:* e.g. Rakuten.csv (The file name must have the ending “.csv.”!)
* *Token:* Click on *Generate token* to generate the token. The token is automatically added to the format’s URL. It is a token for authentication.

. Item filters

* *Filter “Active”*: Select “Active”
* *Filter “Markets”*: Select “Rakuten.de” *Important!* The name may differ. Go to *System » Orders » Order referrer* and check if the name has been adjusted.
* *Filter “Client”* (optional): Select the client. It must be the same client that you have selected in the menu *System » Markets » Rakuten.de* under the option *Mandant (Shop)-Zuordnung* for this account.

. Format settings

* *Setting “Client”*: Select the client. It must be the same client for each account that you have selected in the menu *System » Markets » Rakuten.de* under the option *Mandant (Shop)-Zuordnung* for this account.
* *Setting “Order referrer”* The same as the item filter “Markets”.
* *Setting “Account”:* Select the correct account if you have more than one account.
* *Setting “Overwrite item availability”:* Place a check mark next to the option “overwrite” and write a permissible entry for Rakuten in the field for the item availabilities, for example 0, 3, 5 or 7.

The settings are chosen to ensure that the function is the same as in version 6. Except for item availability, the settings can be changed, for example to exclude further items from export by using the item filters.

You can check the content of the file by downloading the file.

=== Step 4

Use the URL of the Elastic export to set up the import of the file in the seller section of Rakuten.de. If you have little or no experience, contact the Rakuten support team in order to receive help with setting up a schedule.

The setup is now completed.
