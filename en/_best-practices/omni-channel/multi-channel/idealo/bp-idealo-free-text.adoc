= Item export: Filling the column free_text_field
:lang: en
:keywords: idealo, Item
:position: 10

The column *free_text_field*, which is included in the plugin format link:https://marketplace.plentymarkets.com/plugins/markets/ElasticExportIdealoDE_4723IdealoDE^], does not have a fixed function and can be used individually by each retailer. To do so, have your contact person at idealo allocate the *free_text_field* for synchronisation with a specific type of information.

*Limitation:* This field can only have *one* allocation. This means that you cannot use the column *free_text_field* as e.g. specific shipping costs for one item and as e.g. item name for another item.

. Select a property.
.. _Option 1_: Select an existing property of the property type *Text* or *Auswahl*
