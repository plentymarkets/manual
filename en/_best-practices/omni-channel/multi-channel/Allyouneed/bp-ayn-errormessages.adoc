This error message refers to the attribute link.

It is necessary to link plentymarkets attributes and Allyouneed attributes in order to connect them properly with Allyouneed attributes. If they are not linked, the error message cited above will occur.

Attributes are linked here: *System » System settings » Item » Attributes » Open attribute with ID X » Tab: Attribute link » Allyouneed.com*.

.Error message: “Availability is not enabled.”
--
This error message refers to the item availability of the variation.

You can define that only specific variations with specific item availabilities are exported. This is defined in *System » System settings » Markets » Allyouneed » Settings*.

[[item-availability-AYN]]
.Item availability for Allyouneed
image::_best-practices/omni-channel/multi-channel/Allyouneed/assets/bp-ayn-artikelverfuegbarkeit.png[]

Multiple item availabilities can be selected. Choose from the option “ALL” and the 10 item availabilities that can be configured in the menu *System » System settings » Item » Availability*. The *name* of the item availability is displayed.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
If the name of the item availability is empty, an empty column will be displayed which can be selected anyway.
====

If the variation possesses an item availability which is not approved for export at the time of the export, then the error message “Availability is not enabled.” will be issued.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
Items which have already been activated for the marketplace will be deleted if an error occurs during the stock update. Accordingly, the item availability can be used to automatically delete items from Allyouneed whose item availability depends on the stock.

.Error message: Error message 1095
--
The complete error message issued by Allyouneed reads:

`INVALID_MODIFICATION: Die Kategorie X.X.X.X kann nicht genutzt werden, da es Unterkategorien gibt. (Code: 1095)`

(The category X.X.X.X cannot be used because there are subcategories.)

This means that the category link which has been set in *System » System settings » Markets » Allyouneed » Category link* is not permitted. You must always select the lowest possible category level. Check the category links for all categories that are saved for the item.
Another cause might be that Allyouneed’s category structure has been updated and that there are new subcategories which have to be linked.

.Error message: Error message 100
--
The complete error message issued by Allyouneed reads:

`INVALID_DATA: Die angegebene EAN ‘1234567890123’ wird bereits in Produkt ‘274’ verwendet. EAN dürfen nur in Varianten doppelt vergeben werden. Nähere Informationen finden Sie unter link:https://portal.allyouneed.com/hilfe-downloads/downloads-dokumentationen/fehlermeldung-xml/[] (Code: 100)`

(The given EAN ‘1234567890123’ is already used for Product ‘274’. EAN can only be assigned twice for variations. For further information, refer to link:https://portal.allyouneed.com/hilfe-downloads/downloads-dokumentationen/fehlermeldung-xml/[]. Please note that this website is currently only available in German.)

This error message is issued if multiple items are transferred to Allyouneed with the same EAN.

In order to find out which variations are affected, you can analyse the error message as follows:

. *EAN ‘1234567890123’* - Search for this barcode to find potential doublings in the system.
. *Produkt ‘274’* - This is the SKU of the variation which has been listed on Allyouneed and which is now blocking the export of other items because it has the same EAN.

There are two possibilities to fix the issue:

. Make sure that variations which are transferred to the same marketplace each have a unique EAN.
. Do not transfer an EAN for variations which have the same EAN. To do so, you have to have at least two barcodes. Barcodes are organised in the menu *System » System settings » Item » Barcode*. You need one barcode which is released for the order referrer Allyouneed and one barcode which is not released for Allyouneed.
For items whose EAN should not be transferred you have to keep the EAN in the barcode which has not been released for Allyouneed.

The complete error message issued by Allyouneed reads:

`INVALID_DATA: Es gibt bereits ein Produkt mit einer anderen productId ‘XXXX’, das zu den angegebenen Daten ‘EAN:YYYYYYYYYYYYY ZZZ:typ=12.5 kg’ passt. Es ist nicht erlaubt ein identisches Produkt mehrfach anzulegen. Nähere Informationen finden Sie unter link:https://portal.allyouneed.com/hilfe-downloads/downloads-dokumentationen/fehlermeldung-xml/[](Code: 206)`

There are two possibilities to fix the issue:

. Make sure that variations which are transferred to the same marketplace each have a unique EAN.
. Do not transfer an EAN for variations which have the same EAN. To do so, you have to have at least two barcodes. Barcodes are organised in the menu *System » System settings » Item » Barcode*.

(No product/offer with this productId was found. For further information, refer to link:https://portal.allyouneed.com/hilfe-downloads/downloads-dokumentationen/fehlermeldung-xml/[]. Please note that this website is currently only available in German.)

If the product is still on Allyouneed, the SKUs differ. This product must then be deleted manually on Allyouneed.

The complete error message issued by Allyouneed reads:

`PRODUCT_NOT_FOUND: Das Produkt konnte nicht angelegt werden. Es existiert keine Beschreibung für dieses Produkt. (Code: 1040)`

(The product could not be created. No description exists for this product.)

This error message is issued if an offer has been transferred to Allyouneed which does not yet contain a product.

. There is an error concerning the catalogue export in the menu *System » System settings » Markets » Allyouneed » Item export*.

* This error has to be fixed so that the product can be launched.

.Error message: Error message “Delivery time is missing"
--
This error message refers to the estimated shipping time of the variation.

This error message should only occur if no value for shipping time could be calculated.
If this error message occurs contact us and give us the corresponding variation ID as an example.
--

[.collapseBox]
.Error message: Error message “Stock is missing"
--
This error message refers to the variation’s calculated stock.

This error message should only occur if no value for stock could be calculated. If this error message occurs contact us and give us the corresponding variation ID as an example.

[.collapseBox]
.Error message: Error message “SKU is not set"
--
This error message refers to the automatic creation of the SKU during export.

Whether the variation already has an SKU or not is checked during export. If the variation does not have an SKU, the system will try to create an SKU.
The automatic generation of SKUs is based on the variation ID.
If this SKU is already saved in another variation for Allyouneed, the automatic generation will fail because the SKU must be unique for each marketplace and each variation.

If this error occurs, use the item search (*Item -> Edit item*) to check if this SKU is already assigned. Use these filters:

[[FilterSKU]]
.Set filters
[cols="1,2"]
|===
|*Filter* |*Setting*
|Table type |Variations
|SKU (Search text) |Variation ID of the variation for which is affected by this error.
|SKU (order referrer) |Allyouneed
|Active |All
|===

If the SKU has already been assigned, then you must assign the SKU manually for the new item. To do so, go to the corresponding variation and open the *Tab: Availability*.

If the SKU has not yet been assigned, contact us and tell us the corresponding variation ID as an example.

.Error message: Error message "EAN/ISBN is not valid"
--
If you assign an EAN or an ISBN to an item, this number must always have 13 characters for Allyouneed. If the EAN or the ISBN does not contain 13 characters, this error message will appear during export.

There are two possibilities to fix this issue.

. Adjust the EAN/ISBN accordingly.
. Do not transfer the EAN/ISBN to Allyouneed.

The second option is possible because the different barcodes can be released for the marketplaces, as e.g. the sales prices. To do so, go to *System » System settings » Item » Barcode* and open a barcode.
You can define for each barcode for which order referrer it should be valid:

[[Barcode-AYN]]
.Barcode referrers
image::_best-practices/omni-channel/multi-channel/Allyouneed/assets/bp-ayn-barcode.png[]

Hence, it is possible to create two barcodes. One barcode is released for Allyouneed and the other barcode is not released for Allyouneed. Delete the link of the previous barcode and create a new barcode which is linked to Allyouneed.

Use the dynamic export and import of the format link:https://knowledge.plentymarkets.com/en/basics/data-exchange/data-formats/variationbarcode[VariationBarcode] to copy all barcodes which consist of 13 characters into the new barcode so that these barcodes will continue to be exported to Allyouneed.

.Error message: Error message “Price is missing"
--
This error message refers to the variation’s sales price.

If this errors message occurs, there are two possible sources of error.

. The variation’s sales price was set to 0.00 €.
. The variation does not contain a sales price which has also been linked to Allyouneed.

To check the latter possibility, go to *System » System settings » Item » Sales prices*, set the filter *referrer* to *Allyouneed* and use the search.

. If no sales price was found in the search, then no sales price has been defined yet.
In this case, open the settings for the order referrer Allyouneed and activate a sales price. A *price type* must not be activated.
. If no sales price was found in the search, check for all sales prices in the results

* whether a check mark was placed next to any of the settings for *price type*. (Do not activate any settings here!)
* whether the variation’s sales price is correct.
