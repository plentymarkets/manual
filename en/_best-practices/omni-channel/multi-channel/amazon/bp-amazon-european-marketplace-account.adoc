This best practice deals with the error “Request is throttled” and how to solve it.
====

== What does the error message “Request is throttled” mean?

For each procedure, such as order import, shipping confirmations, stock synchronisation etc., the number of requests is limited by Amazon (Maximum Request Quota). If the maximum number of requests is exceeded, the procedure is blocked. Further requests will then be rejected by Amazon. After a certain amount of time, new capacities are enabled for the procedure little by little (The Leaky Bucket Algorithm), and the transfer is enabled once again.

For more information on this topic, see link:http://docs.developer.amazonservices.com/en_DE/dev_guide/DG_Throttling.html[Throttling: Limits to how often you can submit requests^].

==  Major cause of the error:

This error often occurs because if you use a European Amazon marketplace account, a configuration in the plentymarkets system causes too many requests to be sent by this Amazon account.

*Background*: This means that within *System » Markets » Amazon » Settings* multiple Amazon accounts have been deposited for different platforms which all “aim” at the same European marketplace account.

Those accounts always have the same merchant ID. Several options have been selected in one or multiple accounts.

Amazon platforms which are often summarised in one European marketplace account (as of 15 May 2017):

Amazon.de, Amazon.fr, Amazon.it, Amazon.es, Amazon.co.uk

[IMPORTANT]
====
This error might also occur if you use further external programs which access your Amazon account and “overflow” your account in combination with plentymarkets.
====

== How to solve the error:

If you use a European Amazon marketplace account, it is useful to activate procedures for only one marketplace account deposited in plentymarkets within *System » Markets » Amazon » Settings*. Otherwise, the data traffic of those procedures will be transferred for each Amazon account that is deposited in plentymarkets and has the same merchant ID.

[TIP]
.Procedures which often cause this error and which should therefore not be activated multiple times:
====
- Order import
- Stock synchronisation
- Stock changes
====

*P.S.:* An Amazon.com account does not count as a platform of a European marketplace account.
