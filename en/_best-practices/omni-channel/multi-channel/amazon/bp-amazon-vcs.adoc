This best practice informs you about Amazon’s VAT calculation service VCS and explains what to consider when setting VCS up in plentymarkets.

An overview of VCS and an instruction how to activate it in plentymarkets can be found on the <<markets/amazon/amazon-setup#3150, Amazon page of the manual>>.

You can use two different VCS options in plentymarkets:

* VCS Amazon (invoices are generated by Amazon)
* VCS plentymarkets (invoices are generated by plentymarkets)

Amazon VCS is activated in the *System » System settings » Markets » Amazon » Settings » Select Amazon account » Tab: Settings* menu with the *Generate invoice* option.

[IMPORTANT]
.Requirements for using Amazon VCS
====
If you would like to use Amazon VCS, some requirements have to be fulfilled: +
1. Amazon VCS must be activated in the Amazon Seller Central. +
2. Amazon VCS can only be activated in plentymarkets after you have activated it in the Amazon Seller Central.
====

[TIP]
.Workflow when you ship orders yourself (MFN)
====
Keep in mind that you have to send a shipping confirmation prior to generating the invoice. Therefore, if you export items outside of the EU, you only receive the invoice from Amazon after having confirmed the shipment.

Things to know

* The order numbers of the orders in plentymarkets must be synchronised with the Amazon order numbers. Otherwise, invoices cannot be generated by Amazon with VCS.

* Invoices *cannot* be generated in any other way (for example, invoices can no longer be generated manually or with an event procedure).

[.subhead]
Workflow: Invoice generation by Amazon

* Orders are created during the order import.
* The system blocks manual invoice generation for Amazon orders.
* A new tax report is created by Amazon on a daily basis (type: SC_VAT_TAX_REPORT) and imported into plentymarkets.
* The imported tax report (type: SC_VAT_TAX_REPORT) creates an external invoice document for orders which contains the Amazon invoice number. +
*Attention:* Invoices will not be downloaded. The document is merely an external document which cannot be retrieved. It is created for the financial export.

=== VCS plentymarkets: How to find errors

Currently, the following possibilities are available to find sources of errors when generating Amazon invoices with plentymarkets:

* the order itself
* logs
* plugin

[.subhead]
Identifying potential sources of errors

* Whether an invoice was created for the order can be seen in the order itself.
* Whether VCS reports are imported into plentymarkets can be checked in the *Data » Log* menu with the *identifier* *importVCSConnection*.
* Whether sales tax IDs are imported and adjusted can be checked in the *Data » Log* menu with the *identifier* *importVCSConnection*.
* Whether invoices are uploaded correctly, or whether they are uploaded at all, can be checked in the *Data » Log* menu with the *identifier* *VCS invoice upload*.
* If you activated the VCS dashboard plugin in your plentymarkets system (the plugin can currently only be installed by plentymarkets), then you can check potential problems with data synchronisation between Amazon and plentymarkets in a separate menu.

If the identifiers listed above are not available in the log or if there are no entries for these identifiers, then the process was not executed yet.
