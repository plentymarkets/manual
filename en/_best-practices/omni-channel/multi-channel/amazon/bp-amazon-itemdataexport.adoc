This checklist helps you to find out why an item has not been transferred to Amazon. (Please consider the explanatory note below.)

[NOTE]
.A brief explanation might be useful here:
====
In order to export item data to Amazon, you can use the **automatic export** which takes place at night. You can also use the **manual export**. To do so, go to **System » Markets » Amazon » Data exchange » Data export**.
In both cases, a CSV file is generated. **This checklist is supposed to help you when an item is not available in the generated CSV file.** If the item is available in this CSV file, but it is neither displayed on Amazon nor in your Seller Central, you have to check the Amazon error reports for information about why the item has not been accepted by Amazon.
Note that you still need an active data synchronisation with Amazon (in the deposited basic settings for Amazon).
====

== How can I detect if an item has not been exported?

If you can answer all of the following questions with **_No_**, then the item has probably not been exported.

A. Is the item available in the Seller Central?

B. Is there an error message about this item in the Amazon processing reports (in the Seller Central under **Inventory » Add Products via Upload**)?

C. Is the item available in the CSV file which you can generate by using the manual export in the menu **System » Markets » Amazon » Data exchange » Data export**?

[TIP]
.Tip:
====
If you want to test whether one or more specific items cannot be exported, you can flag these items. You can filter the flags in the section of manual export.
====

== How do I proceed to find out why an item has not been exported?

=== Last change

Check whether the last change to the item was made within the last 24 hours because only those items will be exported which were changed within the 24 hours.
You can most easily find out when a variation has been changed the last time when you open the corresponding variation in the item. Within the line of the save icon you can see the date of the last change.

You can also see it in the table view, as in version 6. Switch the view to **Variations** and activate the column **Last change**.

To solve the issue, go to **Item » Batch processing** Tab **Variations** and select the option **Update timestamp for market exports**.

=== Are the settings in the tab “Availability” correct? (for each variation)

In general, the **Web-API** has to be activated and the correct **platform** must be deposited. (If you want to list on Amazon.fr, Amazon France has to be activated etc.).

In order to select order referrers, they have to be set visible. To make them visible in your menu, go to **System » Orders » Order referrer**.

=== Are the settings in the tab “Multi-Channel” correct?

Make sure that the corresponding product type is deposited.

=== Are the filters deposited in the basic settings correct?

This refers to the settings in **System » Markets » Amazon » Settings**. For example, you can define that only items with a specific **flag** should be exported. If the item is not marked with this flag, then the item will not be exported.
You can further define that only those items are exported which are **visible in the store**. If the item is not activated for the store (in the section **Edit item**, Tab:**Settings**), then the item will not be exported.

Also pay attention to the other filters.

=== Price

If the sales price set for Amazon is 0.00 or if the sales price is not enabled for Amazon, then the item will not be exported.
A standard price must be set. The standard price is a sales price which is neither a special offer nor the RRP.
This refers to the option **Price type** in the sales prices under **System » Item » Sales prices**.

=== Active

If the variation is not **active** (Tab: **Settings** of a variation), then the item will not be exported.

[[active]]

The variations with attribute links and the single item variations (i.e. items with main variation only) should be active.
Also consider the following note:

[TIP]
.Deactivating a main variation without attribute link
====
If an item has variations with attribute links but the main variation has no attribute links, then the main variation has to be set inactive. Otherwise the main variation will be exported as single item. The main variation must be active if it has an attribute link.
