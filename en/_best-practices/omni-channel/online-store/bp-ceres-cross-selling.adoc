This Best Practice guide helps you set up item lists of the type *cross-selling* in Ceres.

[NOTE]
.First things first...
====
* This is a Best Practice for the online store plugin *Ceres*. *Ceres* is available in the link:https://marketplace.plentymarkets.com/plugins/templates/Ceres_4697[plentyMarketplace^] and runs on plentymarkets systems.
* This guide assumes that you have already set up cross-selling relations for your items. You can learn how to configure cross-selling for your items <<item/managing-items#950, here>>.

== Setting up cross-selling item lists

Go to *Plugins » Plugin overview » Ceres » Configuration » Item lists*. In this menu you can determine which type of item list you want to use in your online store.
Select the type of cross-selling relation that your item list should display from the *Cross-selling: Cross-selling relation* drop-down list (see box 1 in the image).
You can choose from the options *Similar*, *Accessory*, *Replacement parts* and *Collection*. This cross-selling relation will apply to all cross-selling item lists in your online store.

In the next step you determine which item list you want to use. Edit the *First item list*, *Second item list* or *Third item list* and select *Cross-selling* from the drop-down list. In the example below, the *Second item list* is configured as a cross-selling list (Box 2 in the image).
Enter a German and an English name for your item list in the input fields *Name of the second item list (DE)* and *Name of the second item list (EN)*, respectively.

*Save* the settings you have carried out.

== Displaying cross-selling item lists in the online store

After you have determined which item list you want to use for your cross-selling items, you now choose where the item list is to be displayed in your online store.

Open the *CMS » Container links* menu.

Go to the item list that you have configured as your cross-selling item list, i.e. *First item list*, *Second item list* or *Third item list*.
Choose the layout container in which you want to display your cross-selling item list. In the example below, the second item list is displayed in the container of the single item view.
