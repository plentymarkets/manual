*Ceres*-based online stores will in the medium term replaced all former Callisto online stores. In this context, particular functions of Callisto are successively shut down over the next few months. The <<basics/eol#, EOL manual page>> provides you with all the dates relevant to the shut down of Callisto. +
This chapter’s goal is to help you understand the current state of your Callisto shop and will inform you about the time you need to become active and implement parts of the Ceres online store.

[NOTE]
.First things first
====
* This chapter is only relevant for users who use a Callisto online store. If your online store uses the Ceres plugin technology, this chapter does not concern you.
* We advise you to inform yourself about the change from Callisto to Ceres sooner rather than later. Even though certain Callisto online stores can still be operated until the first quarter of 2020, we no longer support the old software and bundle our resources for the further development of Ceres online stores.

== The three different order processes in Callisto

Since particular functions of Callisto are shut down at different points in time, it is understandable that some customers might not be sure whether or not the changes affect them and at what point they have to become active in order for their stores to operate smoothly. +

The most important aspect of the shut down are the three different order processes in Callisto and the dates at which they are no longer available:

|====
Order process |Date of deactivation

|*Standard order process*
|13.09.2019

|*Individual order process*
|03.02.2020

|====

For customers who are using one of these order processes in their online shop (i.e. everyone who does not use a Ceres online shop) this means that they have to implement the <<online-store/best-practices#standard, Ceres checkout>> (the Ceres order process) by the specified date. The linked best practice guide provides step by step instructions on how to integrate the Ceres checkout. The best practice provides instructions for all three Callisto order processes. +

If you feel overwhelmed by the prospect of integrating the Ceres checkout yourself, there are several professional agencies providing this service in the link:https://marketplace.plentymarkets.com/en/services/setup[plentyMarketplace^]. +
Our link:https://www.plentymarkets.eu/service/partneragenturen/[partner agencies^] might also be of service.


[IMPORTANT]
====
Integrating the Ceres checkout or switching to complete Ceres online store before the specified dates is absolutely necessary. Otherwise, your customers will not be able to place orders in your store.

== Which order process am I currently using in my Callisto store?

In link:https://forum.plentymarkets.com/t/dashboard-welcher-bestellvorgang-ist-aktiv/527626[this forum thread^] we announced that your plentymarkets back end will now display a message informing you about which order process is used in your system. The message also specifies the date this order process is deactivated. +

* The message concerning the *Individual shopping cart* is displayed in red.
* The message concerning the *Standard order process* is displayed in orange.
* The message concerning the *Individual order process* is displayed in yellow.

This suffices to find out which order process you are currently employing in your Callisto store. If you still want to check for yourself, follow these steps: +

[.instruction]
Checking the order process:

. Go to the *CMS » Web design* menu.
. Select the layout you want to check from the drop-down list on the left side. If you have multiple clients, multiple layouts may be active. In this case you should check all layouts individually.
. Click on *Settings*.
. Click on the *Client* tab.
. Select the *client* that is active for the layout on the left.
→ If you need to find out which client has been activated for the layout, hover over the *layout* drop-down list with your mouse. Active clients are displayed in the tooltip.
. On the right side, open the tab *Order process*.
. The *Type of order process* states which order process is active in the selected layout.
→ Depending on whether you see the *Individual shopping cart*, *Default order process* or *Individual order process*, you need to switch to Ceres before the specified dates listed above.

== Next steps

You determined the type of order process in your Callisto online store and now know on which date it is deactivated. +

You now have the following options:

* You can integrate the <<online-store/best-practices#checkout, Ceres checkout>> in your Callisto online store and still operate it until the first quarter of 2020.
* You can set up your <<online-store/setting-up-ceres#, Ceres online store>> and forego an additional adaptation in the first quarter of 2020.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Regardless of whether you want to use the Ceres checkout or a complete Ceres online store: Please make sure that you always make changes in a separate plugin set, so that the live operation of your online store is not impaired. <<online-store/best-practices#callisto-to-ceres, Here>> you can find out how to safely navigate the change from Callisto to Ceres.
