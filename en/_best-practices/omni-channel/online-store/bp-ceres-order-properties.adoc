In this example, we setup a property in which you enter a *Text* to print on a shirt. Upon any entry, a surcharge will be added to the item price.

[NOTE]
.First things first …
====
* This is a *How to* for the online store plugin *Ceres*. *Ceres* is available in the link:https://marketplace.plentymarkets.com/plugins/templates/Ceres_4697[plentyMarketplace^] and runs on plentymarkets 7 systems.
* An integration in individual or altered template plugins is possible, however, this needs individual settings which we cannot go into here.
* *_Note:_* At the moment, only the property with the type *Text* is active.
====


== Creating an Order property

We begin by creating the property.

. Go to *System » Item » Properties*.
. Open the *New property* tab.
. In *Name (internal)*, enter the description of the property for use in your backend.
. Under *Webshop*, select the language code *en*.
. In *Name*, enter the description to display in the item view. In our example, that is 'Shirt print'.
. Select *Text* from the *Property type* drop-down list.
. In *Surcharge*, enter the price for activating the property, e.g. 12.00 £ for a shirt print. +
→ Activate *Display as additional costs* so the customer is shown in the item view which surcharge is linked to the property.
. Under *Show*, activate all four settings to keep the additional costs transparent in the checkout process.
. Activate the setting *Order property* to mark the property as such.
. *Save* the settings. +
→ The property is created.

Your settings should look as follows.

== Linking the Order property with an item

Properties are linked to the item itself. To do so, proceed as follows.

. Go to *Item » Edit item*.
. Select an item to link the property to.
. Go to the *Properties* tab.
. Under *Activate further properties » Properties not assigned to a group*, activate the new property.
. *Save* the settings. +
→ The property is linked to the item and is listed under *Properties*.

[NOTE]
.Surcharges
====
Under *Properties*, you can also enter a surcharge. If you do so, the value here will overwrite the surcharge saved in the property.

== Deploying the plugins

Deploy the plugins in *Productive* to save the changes and display the Order property in the *Item view* and the *Shopping cart*.

Once the customers enters data into the text field, it will be saved and the surcharge will be added to the item price.
