In this Best Practice we will create a property through which you can enter a *text* that can be printed onto a T-shirt. The input will automatically calculate a surcharge for the product.

[NOTE]
.The most important things first:
====
* This is a Best Practice for the online store plugin *Ceres*. *Ceres* is available on the link:https://marketplace.plentymarkets.com/plugins/templates/Ceres_4697[plentyMarketplace^] and runs on plentymarkets systems.
* The integration into individual or modified template plugins is possible. This, however, requires individual adjustments which cannot be considered here.
* *_Note:_* At the moment only properties of the type *Text* are active.
====

== Creating order properties

We begin with an property.

. Go to *Setup » Item » Properties*.
. Click on the *New property* tab.
. Enter the *Name (internal)*. This is the name of the property that is displayed in the back end.
. Enter the *Name* in the *Online store* area. This is the name that your customers see in the item view. In this example we choose “T-shirt print”.
. Choose *Text* from the *Property type* list.
. Enter the *Surcharge* that should be added if the property is used. In this example we choose 12,00 euros for a T-shirt print. +
→ Check the box *Display as surcharge* so that the customer sees the surcharge for the property in the item view.
. Check all the boxes in the *Display* area in order to keep the additional charges transparent throughout the entire order process.
. Check the box *Order property* to define the property as such.
. *Save* the settings. +
→ The property will be created.

Your property interface should now look like this:

== Linking an order property to an item

Properties are directly linked to the item. Proceed as follows:

. Go to *Item » Edit item*.
. Select an item with which the property should be linked.
. Click on the *Properties* tab.
. Go to *Activate further properties » Properties not assigned to a group* and check the box of the created property.
. *Save* the settings. +
→ The property is linked to the item and is shown under *Properties*.

[NOTE]
.Surcharges
====
You can also enter a surcharge in the *Properties* options. If you enter a value here, it overwrites the value of the surcharge that was saved for the property.

== Deploying plugins

Now you will deploy the plugins in a *plugin set* in order to apply the changes. The order property will be available in the *Item view* and the *Shopping cart*.

If the customer inputs something into the text field, the text is saved and the surcharge is added to the item price.

== Setting up order properties with checkboxes

In this Best Practice we will create an order property that is displayed with a checkbox in the single item view. If the checkbox is checked, the surcharge for the product will automatically be calculated.

=== Creating a property group

In the first step we will create a new property group. In our example we want customers to be able to purchase complementary couch accessories through checking the checkbox.

[.instruction]
. Go to *Setup » Item » Properties*.
. Click on the *New property group* tab.
. Enter a *Name (internal)* for the property group to be displayed in the back end.
. In the *Language* area you can enter a name and a description for the property group in various languages to be displayed in the online store.
. Select *None* from the drop-down list *Grouping of order properties (type: "none")*
. *Save* the settings.

=== Creating order properties

After we have created a property group for couch accessories, we now want to set up a new property, e.g. a couch cushion, and link it to the property group.

[.instruction]
. Go to *Setup » Item » Properties*.
. Click on the *New property* tab.
. Enter a *Name (internal)* for the property to be displayed in the back end.
. In the *Webshop* area you can enter a name and a description for the property in various languages to be displayed in the online store.
. Select the newly created property group from the *Property group* drop-down list.
. Select *None* from the *Property type* drop-down list.
. Enter the *Surcharge* that should be added if the property is used. In this example we choose 15.00 euros for a couch cushion. +
→ Check the box *Display as surcharge* so that the customer sees the surcharge for the property in the item view.
. Check the boxes in the *Show* area for the areas in which you want to display the property.
. Check the *Order property* box.
. *Save* the settings.

The order property *couch cushion* has been successfully created.
