The plentymarkets manual supports users every step of the way. Whether you are just beginning to set up your system or you are adding complex processes to help your business run more efficiently. The manual groups plentymarkets functions thematically and describes all of the menus where settings need to be carried out. For example, all of the steps necessary for setting up a market are described on one page. Our video tutorials also supplement the manual. They provide general introductions to new topics or additional descriptions and explanations of specific functions. The new topical structure mirrors the modules offered in plentymarkets and contains information about setting up plentymarkets 7. Find all information below or in the directory tree on the left. Explanations for plentymarkets 6 are only found in the directory tree on the left.

.Manual structure and conventions
--
The manual is intended for users of the software, i.e. people who have access to the plentymarkets backend. plentymarkets is continuously being developed further and these improvements are released on a regular basis. Therefore, the descriptions in this manual may deviate slightly from your backend. This manual intentionally leaves out explanations for some settings. Self-explanatory settings such as where to enter a name, street address, etc. are not described here. Moreover, the manual does not provide any information about the scope of services provided by plentymarkets partners. It is only describes how to set up the interfaces to these partners. Ask the partner directly about the scope of services provided before you begin setting up the interface.
