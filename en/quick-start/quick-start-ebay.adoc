Additionally, the offer is terminated when the stock is sold out and is re-listed when new stock is available. The eBay ranking remains the same. Additionally, you can use the *“out of stock” option* for GTC offers, so that an item is still displayed on eBay, but can no longer be purchased. +

| Setting | Explanation

|*Retrieve orders*
|Select the eBay platform used for automatically retrieving sales from all countries or *Do not retrieve sales*. +
*Retrieve sales from all countries with eBay* = Automatic synchronisation with all active listings. Listings are synchronised hourly. +
Synchronisation is important in certain cases. For example, GTC listings must be synchronised when eBay automatically extends the end time. Furthermore, information such as the delivery address is synchronised. For example, synchronisation is important if the address was changed in the eBay order process. +
*Do not retrieve sales* = No synchronisation with active listings. If this option is selected, sales cannot be retrieved manually either.

|*Retrieve eBay returns*
|Select whether eBay returns should be retrieved or not. +
*Yes* = Activates the eBay return process in plentymarkets. New eBay returns are imported into plentymarkets every 20 minutes. +
*No* =The eBay return process is deactivated in plentymarkets. New eBay returns are not imported into plentymarkets. eBay returns must be edited in the seller’s *My eBay* section instead.

|*Use out of stock control*
|Select whether the out of stock control should be used. +
*Yes* = Listings are not ended if items are unavailable. The offer is displayed but cannot be purchased. The number of items sold will not be set to zero when the item is available again. Rather, the sales history remains as it is. In addition to this option, the *automatic stock update* in the *Initial settings* tab must be activated. Furthermore, this option takes priority over the *End offers automatically* option, i.e. offers are not ended but displayed and cannot be purchased. +
*No* = Listings are ended if an item is not in stock.

|*Price synchronisation*
|Select whether you want to use the price synchronisation. +
*Hourly (with description)* = Price changes are synchronized automatically every hour. The listing’s description is also updated. Use this option if you use a placeholder for prices in the listing’s description. If the listing’s price is tied to the item price, the price synchronisation takes place as soon as the item price is changed. If the listing’s price is not tied to the item price, the price synchronisation takes place as soon as the price for the market listing is changed. +
*Hourly (without description)* = Price changes are synchronized automatically every hour. The listing’s description is not updated. If the listing’s price is tied to the item price, the price synchronisation takes place as soon as the item price is changed. If the listing’s price is not tied to the item price, the price synchronisation takes place as soon as the price for the market listing is changed. +
*No* = There is no automatic price update.

|*Price synchronisation for special sales*

|*Message type*
|Select the message type for eBay messages. +
The type refers to the selected *type* in the *System » CRM » Ticket system* menu. You can also enter your own parameters for eBay there.

|*Message status*

*No* = No copy of the eBay invoice is sent to the seller.

|*Minimum stock to automatically start a listing*
|Enter a value for the minimum stock that should be used for restarting listings automatically. If the entered value is higher than the current stock, listings are not started automatically. This option is useful, e.g. when all items of a listing have been sold and the stock increases due to new incoming items or returns, but you want to restart the listing with a certain stock. +
The entered value for minimum stock doesn't affect GTC offers for which *Yes* was selected in the *Use out of stock control* setting.

|*Variation availability*
|Select a specific *variation availability* or select *ALL* if you want to use all of the items regardless of their availability. +

====

[#600]
=== Linking shipping profiles

Go to *System » System settings » Markets » eBay » Settings » Tab: Shipping profile links* to link eBay shipping profiles to the shipping profiles you created in plentymarkets. A linked shipping profile is automatically used during order import if the shipping profile matches the order data, e.g. account and market settings, of a listing and is activated in the *Global* tab of an item. If the linked shipping profile is deactivated, the active shipping profile with the highest priority will automatically be used instead.

Before linking eBay shipping profiles to the shipping profiles in your online shop, you have to enter terms of payment and shipping as well as general conditions in the *System » Markets » eBay » Business policies* menu.

[#700]
=== Synchronising stock

For all listings with the duration *endless* (GTC), automatic stock synchronisation can be activated. eBay's *End* and *Relist* functions are carried out every 15 minutes. The search ranking remains the same. As soon as a listing is relisted by means of the automatic stock update, all settings of this listing are reloaded and the offer is published on eBay with the new options. Stock is updated in plentymarkets and transferred to eBay every 20 minutes. If you want to update other data, e.g. description or price, the eBay *Update* function must be carried out manually in plentymarkets.

[IMPORTANT]
.Avoiding duplicate listings
====
After booking stock, wait at least 1 hour before manually starting a listing with the GTC function. This will help you avoid duplicate listings. Furthermore, the *Endless lister* function must be deactivated for listings with the duration *endless (GTC)*. This is done in a market listing’s *Base* tab.
====

Go to *Listings » Active listings* and set up the following filters to display all listings using the automatic stock update:

*  Duration: *endless (GTC)*
*  Relisted: *No*
*  Stock dependence: *limited (without reservation)*

All listings displayed when using these filters are affected by the automatic stock update, i.e. all endless listings with limited stock dependence without reservation that were not relisted, will be ended, updated or restarted via the automatic stock update depending on the current net stock.

[#800]
==== Activating the automatic stock update

The automatic stock update is only available for listings with *limited (without reservation)* or *unlimited (with synchronisation)* stock dependence. If a listing with the option *limited (without reservation)* is started, the quantity will be updated whenever changes of stock occur during the entire duration of the offer. The listing will be ended when the stock is sold out and restarted as soon as stock is available. The eBay ranking remains the same. Listings with the option *unlimited (with synchronisation)* are not ended and restarted automatically. The ranking of a listing with a certain duration, e.g. 7 days, remains the same if you search for listings that were ended early and relist them using the *End and restart listing* group function as soon as stock is available.

[.instruction]
Activating the automatic stock update:

. Go to *System » System settings » Markets » eBay » Settings » Tab: Initial settings*.
. Select *Yes* for the *Activate automatic stock update* setting.
. *Save* the settings.

[#900]
==== Relisting automatically

In order to relist a listing on eBay, the listing must have been active at least once and it must not have ended more than 90 days ago. The automatic stock update detects when new stock for an item is available and activates eBay’s *Relist* function. In doing so, the existing eBay ID is transferred. A new offer is created on eBay and linked to your old offer. A new eBay ID is created in the process. The old eBay ranking will be applied, assuming that no data, e.g. the price, has changed.

When the *Use out of stock control* is set in the *System » System settings » Markets » eBay » Settings » Tab: Account settings* menu, the function of the automatic stock update changes. A listing is not ended when an item is out of stock. The item is still displayed but cannot be purchased. The number of items sold is not set to zero on eBay when the item is available again. Rather, the number remains in the sales history. Even when the *End offers automatically* setting is active in the *System » System settings » Listings » Stock* menu, listings are not ended. They cannot be purchased instead.

[#1000]
=== Defining a sales price

Proceed as described below to define a sales price for the eBay country platforms. This price is then displayed on the country platforms.

[.instruction]
Defining the sales price for country platforms:

. Go to *System » System settings » Item » Sales prices » Open sales price » Tab: Settings*.
. In the *Referrer* section, place a check mark next to the desired eBay platform.
. In the *eBay accounts* section, place a check mark next to the desired eBay account.
. *Save* the settings.

[TIP]
.Currency conversion for eBay listings
====
In the *System » System settings » Orders » Payment » Currencies* menu, you can set up currency conversion for listings by selecting *Yes* for the *Automatically update conversion factors daily* option. You have to enter a conversion factor for each currency that you use. +
If you do not want to use currency conversion, pay attention to linking the correct sales price. For example, if you do not want to convert USD into another currency for a listing, the same sales price must be selected for the currency USD and for the platform *US*.
====

[TIP]
.Original currency and standard currency are different
====
Additional information is saved for orders that are imported with a different currency than the standard currency saved in plentymarkets. In this case, both the original currency and the original gross and net amounts are saved for every item included in the order.
====

[#1100]
=== Defining business policies

This chapter teaches you how to define *Terms of payment*, *Shipping conditions*, and a *Return policy* for your eBay listings and how to create *Shipping profiles*. These settings must be carried out for every eBay account and platform individually.

[NOTE]

=== Setting up the checkout process

Carry out the settings for the listings' checkout in the *System » System settings » Listings » Checkout* menu.

[.instruction]
Setting up the checkout:

. Go to *System » System settings » Listings » Checkout*.
. Carry out the settings. Pay attention to the explanations given in <<settings-checkout>>.
. *Save* the settings.

[[settings-checkout]]
.Settings for the checkout
[cols="1,3"]
|====
|Setting |Explanation

|*Default order status*
|Select *Status 1* (incomplete data) or *Status 3* (waiting for payment). +
*Status 1* = The customer is guided through the order process and actively has to complete all steps. This takes place within the online store and the customer is encouraged to buy additional items. +
*Status 3* = The customer receives a summary of the order and does not have to become active. However, the customers can edit certain data, e.g. their addresses. +
You can also change the order status in the listing settings. This listing setting takes priority over the setting that is chosen here.

|*Default order status for orders containing unknown items (ID: -2)*
|Select *Status 2* (waiting for activation) or *Status 3* (waiting for payment).

|*Item names in order items*
|Select *Copy item name from the market* or *Copy item name from the store*.

|*Down-selling in the checkout process*
|Select *Enable* or *Disable*. +
Down-selling means that the customer can reduce the quantity purchased on eBay during the checkout. Up-selling is generally possible for fixed-price items. This is why up-selling cannot be selected here.

|*The quantity purchased at eBay listings (no fixed price items) can be changed by the customer during checkout (up-selling and down-selling)*
|Select *Yes* or *No*. +
*Important:* Neither up-selling nor down-selling is possible if you select the option *No*. This is even true if you selected *Enable* for the option *Down-selling in the checkout process*.

|*Shipping costs for new orders coming from eBay*
|Select *Transfer from eBay *or *Have it calculated by plentymarkets*. +
*Transfer from eBay* = New orders are transferred as open transactions. +
*Have it calculated by plentymarkets* = New orders are imported automatically every 15 minutes and the shipping costs are calculated.

|*Shipping costs for items purchased during checkout*
|Select the shipping costs that should apply to further purchases during checkout. Select *Regular*, *No further shipping costs* or *Yes, but with online store shipping costs*.

|*Item assignment after sale*
|Select one of the following options: +
*Automatically* +
*No automatic assignment based on title* +
*No automatic assignment* +
*Automatic assignment based on title only* +
*Assignment based on external item ID* +
*Assignment of SKU to variation number* +
The item ID *-2* is used if a listing could not be assigned or should not be assigned.

|*Automatically combine open eBay orders*
|Select whether and when orders should be combined and imported. +
*Important:* The setting is only visible if you selected *transfer from eBay* for the *Shipping costs for new orders coming from eBay* option. +

[#2100]
=== Setting up the listing scheduler

With plentymarkets, you can automatically place listings on the market at a certain time and you can automatically restart finished listings. Use the listing scheduler to set up these automatic procedures. Listings can be linked to several listing schedulers.

If you want plentymarkets to automatically start listings at a certain time, you have to define time intervals in the listing scheduler. Either select *days of the week* or up to three *days of the month* in the listing scheduler. In both cases, you also have to choose *starting times* for the listing.

[.instruction]
Setting up the listing scheduler:

. Go to *System » System settings » Listings » Scheduler*.
. Click on *Create new listing scheduler*.
. Carry out the settings. Pay attention to the explanations given in <<settings-scheduler>>.
. *Save* the settings.

[[settings-scheduler]]
.Settings for the listing scheduler
[cols="1,3"]
|====
|Setting |Explanation

|*Name*
|Enter a name for the listing scheduler.

|*Lister*
|Activate or deactivate listings with this listing scheduler.

|*Runtime*
|Select *use listing runtime* or select one of the given runtime options in days. If a runtime in days is selected for the listing scheduler, the system always uses this runtime for the listing even if a different runtime has been entered for the listing itself.

|*Start times*
|Define one or several daily starting times. For technical reasons, if you select several starting times, they all have to be *at least 60 minutes apart from each other*.

|*Distribution*
|Select a time limit in *minutes*. The listings linked to this listing scheduler will be started in equal time intervals throughout the selected period of time. If the value 120 minutes was selected for the distribution of 10 listings, then one listing would be started every 12 minutes.

|*Day*
|Define up to three days that listings should be started on.

|*Weekday*
|Activate *days of the week* that the listing should be started on.
|====

[#2200]
=== Managing layout templates

Use layout templates to give listings a certain layout. The advantage of such a template is that you can only use plain text in the actual item description and do not need any design elements. Thus, layout templates reduce the need for maintenance of the item description. Furthermore, basic and general information, such as the legal disclosure and shipping information, can be saved in the layout template. When adjusting the layout template, these adjustments are applied to all listings linked to this template.

Layout templates for listings use the same structure as the plentymarkets *web design*. The content that you want to display for listings can be saved using template variables and functions in the *Main frame* tab in the *System » System settings » Listings » Layouts* menu. The content is structured with HTML and CSS. The different tabs are described below.

[IMPORTANT]
.Commissioning third-party providers
====
HTML and CSS skills are necessary to create a layout template. We recommend that you commission a service provider to create a layout template if you have little experience with HTML and CSS. Go to *System » System settings » Listings » Layouts* to import a *layout template* that was created externally into plentymarkets.
====

[.subhead]
Main frame

In the *Main frame* tab, enter the visible content for listings that are set up with this layout template. Replace dynamic content such as the item description, item images, listing description and so on with template variables and functions. They are replaced by the corresponding content of the listing.

[.subhead]
HTML structure

In the *HTMLStructure* tab, enter the HTML code that provides the desired structure for the layout template. The template variable *$MainFrame* displays the dynamic content saved in the *Main frame* tab.

[.subhead]
CSS

In the *CSS* tab, set up the cascading style sheet (CSS) that is used to display the layout template. CSS denotes a mark-up language for structured documents. While HTML lets you create the pure content, CSS offers you more possibilities to influence the format and structure of this content, e.g. font type and size.

[#2300]
==== Creating layout templates

[.instruction]
Creating a layout template:

. Go to *System » System settings » Listings » Layouts*.
. Click on *Add* in the lower right-hand side corner. +

|*LayoutTitle*
|Enter a name for the layout template.

|*plentymarkets signature*
|Select which plentymarkets signature is to be used in the listing. +
*plentymarkets logo and slogan* = The standard signature is displayed. +

|*Gallery 1-3*
|Enter the JavaScript code for the content of the data fields *Gallery 1 to 3*. Enter the template variable at the desired location within the *Main frame* tab of the layout template. +
Make sure that the images used are available via URL. To do so, upload the images on the server e.g. using *FTP* or the *image gallery*.
|====

[#2400]
==== Linking a layout template

Next, link listings with the layout template. In order to do so, you need to have created listings in plentymarkets. How to create listings is described in the <<Creating listings, Creating listings>> chapter. +

Use one <<Creating listing templates, listing template>> for several listings. Individual listings are linked directly within the listing.

[.instruction]
Linking listings to layout templates:

. Go to *Listings » Edit listings*.
. Open a listing and click on the *Description and layout* tab.
. Select the *layout template* that you want to link to the listing from the drop-down list.
. Pay attention to the explanations in <<template-variables>>.
. *Save* the settings. +
→ The listing is linked to this layout template.

[#2500]
==== Template variables and template functions

Fill the HTML layout with the desired and necessary template variables and functions thereby adding the corresponding content of the listing to the template. Pay attention to upper and lower case letters in the template variables and functions.

Fill in the item description *{% GetItemDescription() %}* instead of the description that is saved with the listing. This way, you only need to maintain one description text for your online store and listings.

The following table explains the template variable and functions in the *Layout templates* menu in alphabetical order:

[NOTE]
.Use if-logic
====
You can use the <<online-store/online-store/cms-syntax#basics-if, if/else logic>> for layout templates. It functions the same way that the logic works in the plentymarkets *web design*.
====

[#2600]
==== eBay item import

Items can also be created by importing data from eBay. Go to *Data » eBay listings* and carry out the data import in the *Import of eBay listings* section. The whole description of the eBay listing is saved as the item or listing description in plentymarkets. All layout elements (HTML tags etc.) of the listing are imported. Therefore, you need to manually edit the listing after the import. +

If you still wish to immediately start your listings on eBay via plentymarkets, create a layout template containing only the template function *{% GetItemDescription() %}* and nothing else. This way, the existing description is used as the listing description without any additional specifications.

[#2700]
==== Checklist preparing listings

|*Number per lot*
|Define the quantity of items offered in a single listing. The listing price applies to the entire quantity.

|*Stock dependence*
|Select the stock of the listing. Select one of the following options: +

|Tie the price of a listing to the item price. +
Listing type *Fixed price*: When the price changes, it is not automatically changed on the market as well. You have to update the price manually or carry out a stock synchronisation. The price on the market can also change after the stock is synchronised if the exchange rate changed. +
Listing type *Auction*: The item price will be used as the price for the *Buy it now* option.

|*Transfer as item number*
|Select one of the following options which is transferred as the *item number*: +
*do not transfer* = The item number is not transferred. +
*transmit EAN* = International Article Number (EAN) of the item +
*transmit ISBN* = The ISBN is transferred as item number. +
*transmit ePID* = The eBay product ID is transferred. +
*transfer UPC* = The Universal Product Code is transferred. In order to use this option, an EAN has to be selected for the setting *UPC from EAN field*. +

*transmit GTIN* = The Global Trade Item Number is transferred. +
*Custom-made or no-name product* = Select this option if the item is not uniquely identified or if it is not a brand-name item.

|*Markets*
|Select one or multiple markets. *eBay*, *Hood* and *ricardo* are available. If you select the market eBay, you also need to specify the eBay platform. +
Either select a market here and create the listing without template for this market or select a *listing template* from the drop-down list in which a market is defined.

Variations are <<item/introducing-items#_what_is_a_variation, combinations of attributes>>. Surcharges are applied to every combination, e.g. size, colour and material. Variations linked to a listing are also transferred to eBay when starting, restarting or updating the listing.

[IMPORTANT]
.Variations for eBay listings have to match
====
Variations must have the same attributes for eBay listings. It is not allowed to start listings that have variations with different attributes.
====

Sellers who list brand-name items in new or manufacturer-refurbished condition are required to include product identifiers in certain categories. The mandatory product identification also applies to eBay listings with variations in certain categories. The *manufacturer* and the MPN need to be specified for the entire listing. The *UPC* or *EAN* have to specified for every variation.
