:description: Learn how to use plentymarkets.
:position: 10

This quick start helps you set up your online store and publish it on the internet. All of the topics are also described in detail in other chapters of the manual. Click on the links to access more detailed information.

The quick start is divided into the chapters <<#10, Initial settings>>, <<#250, Setting up the item catalogue>>, <<#500, Setting up the online store>> and <<#750, Setting up automatic processes>>. Each chapter covers one aspect of setting up your online store. Work through these chapters in the given order, as each chapter builds on the previous ones. The quick start aims to help you set up a functional online store as quickly as possible. As such, it only describes the most necessary functions.

First, the *Preparation* sub-chapter lists any requirements or tasks that need to be completed before you begin. Second, additional sub-chapters describe how to set up the system. Each step of the process is explained in detail and is clearly laid out. A checklist gives you the chance to make sure that all of the necessary steps were carried out.

The <<#1000, Final check>> serves to review everything before your plentymarkets system goes live. Check the settings very carefully so that potential customers do not become involuntary beta testers of your system, but rather bring in your first revenue. In addition, familiarise yourself with the basic legal conditions of electronic commerce and comply with these regulations. Otherwise, you might receive expensive warnings from your competitors.

[#10]
== Initial settings

This chapter provides information about the basic settings that you configure in the plentymarkets *System* menu to set up a functional online store. The chapter describes how to manage user accounts, configure email settings and set up shipping options.

[#20]
=== Preparation

Here you will find information about the most important requirements and preliminary tasks for configuring the initial settings. You will also learn which data is needed for the quick start.

[#30]
==== Install an appropriate browser

Install Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox or Safari (Mac OS).

[TIP]
.Browser compatibility
====
plentymarkets is optimised for the browser link:https://www.google.com/intl/de/chrome/browser/[Google Chrome^].You can also access the system via link:https://www.mozilla.org/de/firefox/products/[Mozilla Firefox^] or link:http://www.apple.com/de/safari/[Safari (Mac OS)^]. This limitation only applies to the admin area. Your online store can be accessed with all of the typical Internet browsers.
====

[#40]
==== Have your email account data ready

You have to save your email access data in the system before plentymarkets can send emails from your email account. Therefore, have the account details at hand for the email address that should be used to send notifications to customers (e.g. info@mystore.com). Use the same settings as in your email program (e.g. Outlook or Thunderbird).

[#50]
==== Have your tracking URL ready

Have the tracking URL of your shipping service provider at hand. Customers can use this link to track their orders online. For this option, the shipping service provider's tracking URL has to be entered in the system.

The currently valid tracking URLs of integrated shipping service providers can be found on the <<order-processing/fulfilment/preparing-the-shipment#2500, Preparing the shipment>> page of the manual. You can access the chapters on shipping service providers via the chapter *Overview of shipping service providers*. Please note that plentymarkets does not assume any responsibility for the accuracy and currency of the tracking URLs. Ask the shipping service provider for the tracking URL.

[#60]
==== Have your access data ready and log in for the first time

Have your plentymarkets access data at hand. You received this data via email. This is the URL of the test system, your user name, your password and your plenty ID. Use this data to log into the admin area of your plentymarkets system for the first time.

[.instruction]
First login:

. Start your browser.
. Find the URL that you received via email and enter this URL into the browser's address line. +
→ The field *plenty ID* is already filled in.
. Save a bookmark for your plentymarkets system. +
The *plenty ID* will already be filled in when you access the page the next time.
. Use the access data to log into the admin area of your plentymarkets test system. +
 → The plentymarkets back end will open.

[#70]
==== Allowing pop-ups

Pop-ups are used in various areas of the back end, for instance for providing documents for download. You have to include your plentymarkets back end in the popup whitelist of your browser in order to ensure smooth operation. Proceed as described below.

[.instruction]
Allowing pop-ups:

. Open your browser.
. Open the settings.
. Go to the pop-up exception management.
. Enter the link *https://[&#42;.]plentymarkets-cloud-de.com:PID* for aws01 and *https://[&#42;.]plentymarkets-cloud-ie.com:PID* for aws02 in the exception list. Please replace *PID* with your plenty ID. +
→ The exception for your back end is added.

[#80]
=== Managing user accounts

The admin area of your plentymarkets system is password protected and can only be accessed by registered users. Therefore, we will start by looking at how to create and manage user accounts. Go to <<basics/working-with-plentymarkets/manage-users#, System » Settings » User>> to create and manage users. Every user is given an individual user account and is assigned to a user class. The user classes are preset and include specific rights.

[#90]
==== Creating a new user

A standard user with administrator rights and the user class *Admin* is already available in your test system. We recommend that you change this user account immediately and save your own password.

The administration area contains sensitive data and has to be efficiently protected from unauthorised access and hackers. Therefore, handle user accounts with great care and only use passwords with at least 8 characters.

[IMPORTANT]
.Caution: Pay attention to password strength!
====
If you try to save a weak password, you will receive the error message *Code 900: Password entered is too weak!* Your password should always contain a mixture of lower-case letters, upper-case letters and numbers. Pay attention to the colour-coded bar and percentage in the system. If possible, use a password that has a "green" rating.
====

[.instruction]
Creating a new user:

. Go to *System » Settings » User » Accounts*.
. Click on *New*. +
→ The <<basics/working-with-plentymarkets/manage-users#10, Create new user>> window will open. (<<image-creating-user>>)
. Enter the *User name*, *Actual name* and *Password*.
. Repeat the password.
. Enter the new user's email address. This will allow the user to receive messages from the system.
. Select a *User class* (see <<classes-rights>>).
. *Save* the settings.

[[image-creating-user]]
.Creating a new user
image::basics/first-steps/assets/EN-Quick-Start-01.png[Creating a new user:]

[NOTE]
[[classes-rights]]
.Classes and their rights
====
A ﻿ user class contains specific user rights.

- For example, the class *Admin* contains all of the rights without limitation. At least one user must be an admin. This is because only a user with the user class *Admin* is authorized to manage and edit other user accounts without restriction.
- Use the class *Variable* to set up individual rights for each user. This allows you to give variable users the exact read and write permissions they need.
- The classes *Call centre*, *API*, *Logistics* and *Blog* have limited rights.
====

[#100]
==== Editing a user

Proceed as follows to edit a user.

[.instruction]
Editing a user account:

. Go to *System » Settings » User » Accounts*.
. Click on *Open user*. +
→ The user will open in a new tab (see <<image-editing-user>>).
. Carry out additional settings as desired. For further information, refer to the explanations on the <<basics/working-with-plentymarkets/manage-users#20,Editing users>> page of the manual.
. *Save* the settings.

[[image-editing-user]]
.Editing a user
image::basics/first-steps/assets/EN-Quick-Start-02.png[Editing a user]

[TIP]
.Password is saved
====
The password you entered when creating your user account will not be visible in editing mode later on, but it is saved. You do not have to re-enter the password when editing the user account.
====

[#110]
==== Setting a user as owner

====

[#150]
==== Setting up the email information service

Use the <<crm/sending-emails#700,Information service>> to have more control over the emails that are sent by the system. This function can send all outgoing emails as blind copies (BCC) to an email address of your choice. It can also send an email notification every time a new order is placed in your online store. You need to know which email address the information service should send emails to.

[.instruction]

[#160]
==== Setting up email templates

plentymarkets creates all emails based on <<crm/sending-emails#1200, Templates>>. This section teaches you how to create email templates or edit existing templates as needed. The section <<#750, Setting up automatic processes>> teaches you how to link the sending of emails to specific events and how to automatically send emails at specific times of day.

The following table includes a list of email templates that we recommend creating when you start working with plentymarkets.

[[table-recommen-email-templates]]
.Recommended email templates for the quick start
[cols="1,3"]
|====
|Email template |Explanation

|*Order: Invoice as PDF attachment*
|Sends an invoice to the customer as an attachment.

|*Order: Partial payment received*
|Informs the customer if a partial payment is received (is described further below).

|*Order: Shipping confirmation*
|Is sent when the items are shipped.

|*Order: Incoming payment is complete*
|Informs the customer that their cash in advance payment has been received.

|*Order: Payment reminder*
|Reminder in case of outstanding payments.

|*Online store: Confirmation of store order*.

|====

You need to create documents for the emails and upload them in PDF format before you will be able to send these documents as attachments.

[WARNING]
.Do not forget the bank and contact details
====
Make sure that all of your email templates contain your bank details (it is also possible to use template variables) and that your current contact information is displayed at the end.
====

Your test system already contains several predefined <<crm/sending-emails#1200, email templates>>. The email template *Confirmation of store order* is used as an example for how to customise email templates to meet your needs.

[.instruction]
Customising the email template “Online store: Confirmation of store order”:

. Go to *System » Client » Select client » Email » Templates*.
. Open the *General email templates* folder and click on *Online store: Confirmation of store order*.
. Carry out the settings. Pay attention to the information given in <<table-setup-email-templates>>.
. Add the cancellation rights.
. Add your contact details at the end of the template.
. *Save* the settings.

[IMPORTANT]
.Insert complete information about cancellation rights
====
Due to legal reasons, the email template you create for *Online store: Confirmation of a store order* should also include the complete information about your <<#530, *cancellation rights*>>. Also pay close attention to any wording in the email template that relates to the contract between you and your customer. It is best to have your text checked by a legal adviser and then enter this exact wording into your email templates.

|Setting |Explanation

2+|Tab: Settings

|*Owner*
|Select an owner or the option *ALL*.

|*Name*
|Name of the email template used for internal reference only and not visible for the recipient.

|*Content*
|Select *Plain text only* or *Only text in HTML format*.

|*Template type*
|Select *All* (default setting) if you want the email template to be used for all areas. If you want to use the template in only one area, you can define this area here. The areas *Order*, *Customers*, *Online store*, *Ticket* and *Scheduler* can be selected.

|*PDF attachment*

2+|Tab: Email message

|*Select a language*
|Select the language for the template text and the subject.

|*Subject*
|Enter a sentence to be displayed to the recipient in the subject line of the email. Choose the subject carefully so that the emails will be recognised by the email account and displayed in the customer's inbox instead of his or her spam folder.
|====

[TIP]
.Setting up plain text emails
====
Start by creating plain text emails only. Enter your text in the tab *Email message » Tab: Content*. HTML offers you more formatting options, but it also increases the risk that your emails will end up in your customers' spam folder. Therefore, we recommend that you use plain text only for important emails.
====

[.subhead]
Inserting template functions and template variables into email templates

In plentymarkets, <<crm/sending-emails#1200,email templates>> not only consist of text but also of <<crm/sending-emails#1300,template variables and template functions>>. When plentymarkets sends emails, it automatically replaces the variables with the corresponding content. The customer's name will appear instead of the variable *$CustomerFullName*. The customer's email address will appear instead of *$CustomerEmail*. The order number will appear instead of the variable *$OrderID*.

[[image-template-variables-and-functions]]
.Template variables and template functions
image::basics/first-steps/assets/EN-Quick-Start-03.png[Template variables and template functions]

[IMPORTANT]
.Variable names are case-sensitive
====
Template variables and template functions trigger predefined system commands. They will only be recognised if you use the exact same spelling as shown in the system (upper and lower case letters must match as well). To avoid malfunctions caused by spelling mistakes, copy the variables and insert them at the desired position in the editing window.
====

[.instruction]
Inserting template variables and template functions:

. Click on *Template variables and template functions* (<<image-template-variables-and-functions>>, red arrow) in the *Email template*. +
→ The *Template variables and template functions* window will open.
. Copy the *variable* that you want to insert into the email template.
. Insert the variable into the text field of the *Email message » Content* tab of the email template.
. *Save* the settings.

The variable *Link_Checkout()* should be included in all emails that you send to customers. Customers can click on this URL to access the *My account* area of your online store. In this area, customers can view and edit their personal information, view their order history, add notes or additional items to their order and also keep track of their order's status.

[.subhead]
Attaching files to email templates

You can attach two different types of files to your email templates: a PDF attachment and a document attachment. +
PDF attachments, such as invoices, are generated in the *System » Client » Select client » Locations » Select location » Documents* menu. Document attachments for other files, such as item brochures or instructions, are saved in the menu *CMS » Documents*.

// TODO: Xxx

[.subhead]
Creating and attaching PDFs

The system automatically generates the documents that are sent as PDF attachments. An example of such a document is the invoice.

It is set up in three steps. First, create a document template on your computer. For example, create a template for business letters with your logo. Save the template as a PDF file. Second, go to <<order-processing/orders/order-documents#, System » Orders » Documents>> and select the settings for the document. Third, select the PDF attachment for the email template.

[.instruction]
Editing the document:

. Go to *System » Client » Select client » Locations » Select location » Documents*.
. Open the document that you want to edit, e.g. the *Invoice*.
. Select a *Language* from the drop-down list, e.g. *en* for English.
. Configure the settings in the *Template* tab.
. Click on the tab *PDF template* and click on *Add template*.
. Select a *Payment method* if needed.
. Click on *Choose template file*.
. Open the PDF document template that you previously created.
. *Save* the settings.
. Click on *Preview* to see a document preview.

[.instruction]
Attaching a PDF document to an email template:

. Go to *System » Client » Select client » Email » Templates*.
. Open the email template.
. Select the file that you want to use as an attachment from the *PDF attachment* drop-down list.
. *Save* the settings. +
→ The file is attached.

[.subhead]
Creating and attaching documents

All of the documents you want to attach to an email have to be uploaded to the server first. The terms and conditions are an example of such a document. This document is often sent as an attachment along with the order confirmation.

It is set up in two steps. First, upload the document in the <<omni-channel/online-store/setting-up-clients/cms#documents,CMS » Documents>> menu. Second, attach the document to an email template. To do so, proceed as follows.

// TODO: Xxx

[.instruction]
Uploading a document:

. Go to *CMS » Documents*.
. Click on *Browse...* in the *Upload* tab.
. Select the *file* that you would like to upload and click on *Open*.
. Select one of the options from the *Right* drop-down menu.
. Enter a *folder name* (optional).
. *Save* the settings.

The *Right* option specifies whether the document should be visible to *Employees* or *Customers* only or to all visitors of your online store (= Public).

[.instruction]
Attaching a document to an email template:

. Go to *System » Client » Select client » Email » Templates*.
. Open the email template and select the file that you want to use as an attachment from the *Document attachment* drop-down list.
. *Save* the settings. +
→ The file is attached.

[#170]
=== Setting up shipping options

This section teaches you how to set up shipping options. First, decide which <<order-processing/fulfilment/preparing-the-shipment#100,countries>> you want to deliver your items to. Second, divide these countries into <<order-processing/fulfilment/preparing-the-shipment#400,regions>>. Such groups will help you create and manage shipping options more easily in the future. Third, create one or more <<order-processing/fulfilment/preparing-the-shipment#800,shipping service providers>> and afterwards <<order-processing/fulfilment/preparing-the-shipment#1000, shipping profiles>>. Fourth, create a <<order-processing/fulfilment/preparing-the-shipment#1500,table of shipping charges>> for each shipping profile.

There is a special concept for configuring shipping options in plentymarkets. You determine which shipping method and shipping costs are assigned to orders depending on the country of delivery and the <<omni-channel/order-referrer#,order referrer>>. For example, you can manage your eBay platform with several different eBay accounts and you can differentiate between specific types of listings. This allows you to set up a very elaborate shipping cost management system.

[#180]
==== Setting up countries of delivery

The overview lists all of the <<order-processing/fulfilment/preparing-the-shipment#100,countries of delivery>> included in ISO 3166-1.

[NOTE]
.At least one country of delivery required for shipping
====
You have to activate at least one country of delivery before you can define shipping costs.
====

[.instruction]
Setting up countries of delivery:

. Go to *System » Orders » Shipping » Settings*.
. The *Countries of delivery* tab opens. Use the drop-down list in the *Active* column to set countries of delivery to *Active*.
. In the *Warehouse* column, select which warehouse should be chosen as the default warehouse for this country's orders.
. *Save* the settings.

[#190]
==== Setting up regions

Now set up regions and assign your countries of delivery to these <<order-processing/fulfilment/preparing-the-shipment#400,regions>>. It is necessary to create regions because shipping costs can only be saved for regions, not for individual countries. All countries that have the same shipping costs should be assigned to the same region.

[.instruction]
Grouping countries of delivery into regions:

. Go to *System » Orders » Shipping » Settings*.
. Open the *Regions » New region* tab.
. Select the countries for the region from the *Available countries*. +
→ The countries will be moved to *Selected countries*.
. Enter a *Name* for the region, e.g. Europe.
. *Save* the settings. +
→ The new region is now available in the *Overview* tab.

Follow the same pattern to create other regions until all countries of delivery have been assigned to a region and the *Available countries* area is empty.

[#200]
==== Setting up shipping service providers

In this area, set up the <<order-processing/fulfilment/preparing-the-shipment#800,shipping service providers>> that you want to use for sending items to your customers.

[.instruction]
Setting up a shipping service provider:

. Go to *System » Orders » Shipping » Settings*.
. Click on the *Shipping service provider* tab.
. Click on *New*. +
→ A new line will be added at the bottom of the overview.
. Enter the *Name* of the shipping service provider into the line.
. Enter this shipping service provider's *Tracking URL*.
. *Save* the settings.

The tracking URL is used to track shipments. By entering the URL in your plentymarkets system, you will be able to include it in the shipping confirmation you send to customers. This allows customers to track the items that are currently being delivered. Ask the shipping service provider for the tracking URL. The website links of integrated shipping service providers can be found on the <<order-processing/fulfilment/preparing-the-shipment#2500,Preparing the shipment>> page of the manual. The tracking URL needs to include the package number and may also need to include the recipient's postcode. This ensures that customers receive the tracking URL that matches their shipment. Insert the template variables *[PaketNr]* and *[PLZ]* into the tracking URL. This way, you don’t have to manually enter this information for each shipment.

An example of a DHL tracking URL with such template variables: +
+http://nolp.dhl.de/nextt-online-public/set_identcodes.do?lang=de&amp;zip=[PLZ]&amp;idc=[PaketNr]+

[TIP]
.Changing the names of shipping service providers
====
You can create new providers or change the names of already existing providers. You can enter general names or the actual names of shipping service providers, such as DPD or DHL. The name that is entered will appear in the shopping cart and on the invoice.
====

[#210]
==== Setting up shipping profiles

<<order-processing/fulfilment/preparing-the-shipment#1000, Shipping profiles>> include detailed shipping costs and specify how these costs are calculated. For example, shipping costs can be based on the item weight, volume or the item prices. You can create several different shipping profiles for each shipping service provider. For example, you can set up a standard shipping profile and an express shipping profile for each provider. If multiple shipping profiles are available, customers will be able to select the profile they prefer in the online store.

Link the shipping profiles to your items so that plentymarkets knows how an item should be shipped and only allows customers to choose from the correct shipping profiles in the online store.

It is also possible to use multiple shipping profiles for mixed orders. The system will then add up the various shipping prices into a total and will show this price to the customer. If a customer not only wants to purchase items which you would usually ship with DHL, but also selects an item that can only be delivered by a shipping company for larger items, the shipping prices that you saved for each shipping profile will be added up by the system and shown as a total.

[TIP]
.Keep the shipping profiles simple
====
Keep your shipping profiles as simple as possible. The more complex the settings are, the more likely it is that errors will occur. In addition, shipping cost models that are too complex may confuse customers and ultimately deter them from making a purchase.
====

==== Creating tables of shipping charges

After you have created your shipping profiles, you can edit your shipping costs. To do so, create an individual table of shipping charges for each region. Before you enter data, you have to decide on one of the <<order-processing/fulfilment/preparing-the-shipment#1600,calculation types>> offered for each region.

[.instruction]
Creating tables of shipping charges:

. Go to *System » Orders » Shipping » Settings*.
. Click on the *Shipping profiles* tab.
. Open the shipping profile.
. Click on the *Table of shipping charges* tab within the shipping profile.
. Select a *Calculation type*. Pay attention to the information given in <<table-shipping-charges-calculation>>.
. Enter the shipping charge.
. *Save* the settings.

[[table-shipping-charges-calculation]]
.Table of shipping charges; calculation types
[cols="1,3"]
|====
|Calculation type |Explanation

|*Flat rate*
|Enter a flat rate charge, e.g. 6.00 EUR. Determine an item value starting from which shipping costs should be omitted (optional).

|*Weight-dependent*
|Enter a sliding scale. Shipping costs usually increase as the weight of the shipment increases. Make sure to enter the weight for each item later on. The heaviest weight entered will be the maximum weight that the customer can order.

|*Volume-dependent*
|Enter a sliding scale for volumes in cubic meters. Make sure to enter the measurements for each item later on.

|*Quantity-dependent*
|Enter a sliding scale. Shipping costs usually increase as the quantity of items increases.

|*Price-dependent*
|Enter a sliding scale. Determine the shipping costs that should apply up to each value of items.

|*Item shipping charge*
|Customers know this type of shipping charge from eBay. Selecting this option means that customers will pay a certain amount for the first item and a (usually lower) amount for each additional item. In addition, you can enter a flat rate charge, which will be applied starting from a certain value of items. Finally, you can determine the value of items starting from which shipping costs should be omitted completely.
|====

You can define upper and lower limits by entering data into the fields *Minimum value* and *Maximum value*. Also check whether you need shipping profiles that go beyond the defined upper and lower limits. For example, if you limit a shipping profile to a maximum value of 200 EUR, you will need another shipping profile so that an order of more than 200 EUR can actually be delivered.

[#230]
=== Checklist

[#250]
== Setting up a catalogue of items

All items and variations are listed in the <<item/managing-items#, Item » Edit item>> menu. You can search for and edit the items here. In new plentymarkets systems, you will find some test items in this menu. You have access to various functions in the *Procedures* column of the overview. These procedures are described in <<table-procedures-item-overview>>. Use the filters on the left to search for items. These filters are described in further detail on the <<item/managing-items#350, Searching for items and variations>> page. A bit of preparation is necessary before putting the first items into the system, e.g. deleting the sample items and creating categories and attributes.

[[image-creating-item]]
.Procedures in the item overview
[cols="1,3"]
|====
|Procedure |Explanation

|*Editing items*
|Open the *Global* tab of the item to edit the item's global data.

|*Visible in online store*
|Display the item in the online store.

|*Listing*
|If a listing is available, it will open and can be edited.

|*New listing*
|Open the *New market listing* window to create a listing for this item.
|====

[#260]
=== Preparation

Here you will find information about the most important preliminary tasks and requirements for configuring your items. Delete the test items and determine item availability and delivery times for your online store.

[#270]
==== Deleting the test items

We recommend that you delete the test items saved in new plentymarkets systems since they are not part of your actual product portfolio. Test items are included in your system by default and are solely intended to help you understand plentymarkets. If you create additional test items and categories in your system and you do not want to use them in your actual product portfolio, delete this test data as well before you finish creating your catalogue.

[.instruction]
Deleting test items using the group function:

. Go to *Item » Edit item*.
. Set the *Active* filter to *ALL*.
. Click on *Search*. +
→ All items saved in the system will be displayed.
. Select all items by clicking on the item ID.
. Click on *Item group function*. +
→ The *Item group function* window will open.
. Activate the *Delete items* option.
. Click on *Execute*. +
→ All items will be deleted from the system.

[#280]
==== Entering item availability texts and delivery times

You are legally required to provide information in your online store about how long it takes to deliver items that can't be shipped immediately. In plentymarkets you manage this information using a ten-stage notification system. Item availability is indicated by a symbol and an availability text in the online store.

In the menu *Settings » Item » Availability* you will find default texts that have already been saved for the different levels of availability. You can make changes to these default texts. Typical availability texts are e.g. "ships within 24 hours" or "ships within 3-5 business days".

[IMPORTANT]
.Select the availability carefully
====
Carefully consider whether you want to enter a very short delivery period, e.g. 24 hours, since you can be held liable for it. You have to keep the promises that you make to your customers. Also keep in mind that this content will be analysed and displayed by search engines.
====

[#290]
=== Defining categories

Categories help you structure your product portfolio and organise your online store. Consider which categories and subcategories you want to display in your online store. It is best to prepare this information in a document before you begin.

[TIP]
.Maximum of 4 navigation levels
====
The *Ceres* online store emphasises user-friendliness. The default navigation bar displays a maximum of one other category level beneath the main categories. Alternatively the mega menu provides the possibility of displaying up to three other levels beneath the main categories. Both navigation bars are optimised to quickly lead your customers to their destination.
====

[#300]
==== Creating categories of the type item

Create <<item/managing-categories#, categories>> of the type *Item* to sort your items. You can either create the categories now, as described below, or you can do this when you create items later. We recommend that you create all categories and subcategories now. This will help you to structure and understand your product portfolio. +
Categories do not appear in the online store as soon as they are created. Rather, they become visible once the category is activated and an item has been added to the category. The item also needs to be visible in the online store. Your online store navigation is automatically generated from the categories in your system that have items assigned to them.

[.instruction]
Creating a new category:

. Go to *Item » Categories*.
. Click on *New category*. +
→ The *Create new category* window will open.
. Enter a name.
. Select the category type. +
→ If you activate *Subcategory*, select the category that should include the new subcategory.
. Click on *Create*. +
→ The new category will be created and displayed in the category tree.

It is possible to create a subcategory on the third or fourth level. Click on the folder icon to open the main category. Then open the folders of the subcategories until you have reached the category that should include the new subcategory. Right-click on a category to open the context menu where you can edit the category or create further subcategories.

[#310]
==== Entering position numbers for categories

Categories can be sorted according to their position number in the navigation bar. New categories are always given the position number 0.

[.instruction]
Entering the position number:

. Go to *Item » Categories*. Click on the category that should receive a different position number. +
→ The *Settings* tab of the category will open.
. Enter a value for *Position*.
. *Save* the settings.

Reload the *Categories* tab once you have entered and saved a position number for each category. Any open categories will close automatically.

[#320]
==== Assigning the category to a client

A category of the type *Item* will only be displayed in the online store if it is linked to at least one item that is visible in the store and if the category is assigned to a client. You can also assign a category to several clients. Please note that you need to save a category name for every client in the corresponding language. To do this, go to *Item » Categories* and use the dropdown lists from the toolbar.

[.instruction]
Assigning the category to a client:

. Go to *Item » Categories* and click on the directory tree. Click on the category that you want to assign. +
→ The *Settings* tab of the category will open.
. Activate the *Client (store)*.
. *Save* the settings.

[#330]
==== Displaying the category names in the browser tab

Enter a meta title if you want the category name to be displayed in the browser tab.

[.instruction]
Displaying the category names in the browser tab:

. Go to *Item » Categories* and click on the directory tree. Click on the category that you want to assign. +
→ The *Settings* tab of the category will open.
. Enter a *meta title*.
. *Save* the settings.

[#340]
=== Creating attributes

Attributes are used to create variations in plentymarkets. Variations are different versions of an item. Variations differ in one way or several ways but are otherwise the same item. An example would be an item that is available in three different colours. The customer should be able to choose from these three variations when ordering. In plentymarkets, you do not need to create a new item for each variation. Instead, you can enter <<item/managing-items#390,attributes>> and assign them to an item. An example for creating the attribute *Colour* is given below.

[.instruction]
Creating the attribute "Colour":

. Go to *System » Item » Attributes*.
. Click on the *New attribute* tab.
. Enter information into the fields *Name* and *Name (internal)*, e.g. *Colour*. +
→ The entry under *Name* will be displayed in the online store later.
. *Save* the settings. +
→ The new attribute is added to the list.
. Expand the attribute.
. Open the *Values* tab.
. Enter the values for this attribute.
. *Save* the settings.

[#350]
=== Creating items

The items and item variations that you sell are the foundation of your business. You need to create an item before you can add variations to it. You will learn how to add variations to an item in a later chapter. First, you need to create the main item in the menu <<item/managing-items#, Item » Edit item>>.

[#380]
=== Setting up stock management

In order to have a functional stock management system, you will need to set up at least one warehouse and supplier and you will have to save stock.

If you do not want to track stock in plentymarkets, open the menu *Item » Edit item*, click on the tab *Variation ID » Settings* and select the option *Do not administer stock for this variation* for the *Limitation* setting. Skip to the chapter <<#410, Managing item images>>.

[.instruction]

.Correcting stock
====
Correct the stock if you have already booked stock for the main item and now you want to specify how many of those items are in each variation.
====

[#400]
=== Automating the availability information in the online store

If you work with the stock function in plentymarkets, you can fully automate the availability information that is displayed in your online store. In this case, your online store automatically sets the symbols *available* and *not available* depending on your current stock. Alternatively, items that are not in stock can also be hidden completely (set to *invisible*). Additionally, you can instruct plentymarkets to show the items again (set to *visible*) as soon as they are back in stock.

[.instruction]
Automating the availability information:

. Go to *Item » Edit item*.
. Open the item. +
→ The *Settings* tab of the main variation opens.
. Select the option *To net stock* from the *Limitation* drop-down menu in the *Availability* area.
. Activate the following options under *Availability*: +
*Available if net stock is positive* +
*Not available if net stock is 0 or negative* +
*Store: visible if net stock is positive* +
*Store: invisible if net stock is 0 or negative*
. *Save* the settings.

Item <<item/managing-items#180,availability>> changes continually. This makes it necessary to constantly update the information, which is generally very time-consuming. Of course, you can manually update the availability of your items in the beginning. However, you should think about implementing a more efficient solution in the future. If you already manage the availability of your items somewhere else (e.g. in an external stock management software) or if you obtain such information electronically from your wholesaler, then plentymarkets can import this information. The import may take a little bit of preparatory work.

[NOTE]
.Is an import possible?
====
If you have already created a database or if you can export item data from another system, you should check the <<basics/data-exchange/importing-data#, import options>> before entering data manually. Data can be imported into plentymarkets with a CSV file. This may require a bit of preparatory work. Your plentymarkets system also offers several convenient interfaces to popular software solutions.
====

[#410]
=== Managing item images

Use the item's <<item/managing-items#90,Images>> tab to save images for the item and link these images to the variations of this item. You can upload up to 25 images per item. These images can be in JPG/JPEG or PNG format. You should upload the first image, i.e. the main image, in *JPG* format because this image will be used for eBay.

[.instruction]
Saving images for an item:

. Go to *Item » Edit item*.
. Open the item.
. Open the item's *Images* tab.
. Drag and drop new images into the *Insert a new image* area. Alternatively, click on *Select files*.
. Select the clients and/or referrers for which you want do use the image from the drop-down list *Availability*.
. *Save* the settings.

[#420]
=== Linking images with variations

Now, link the images saved for the item with one or more of its variations. To do so, proceed as described below.

[.instruction]
Linking item images with variations:

. Go to *Item » Edit item*.
. Open the item.
. Open the item's *Images* tab. +
→ A preview of all images saved for the item is displayed.
. Place a check mark on the left for those images that you want to link with one or more of the variations.
. Click on *Variation link* at the bottom of the page. +
→ The *Variation link* window opens.
. Select the variations that you want to link with the selected images.
. Click on *Link*. +
→ The images are linked with the selected variations.

If you prefer to store the item images on an external server or on your own webspace, you can also use the *URL* field to link the externally stored images with the items.

Larger quantities of images should be transferred to the server via <<item/managing-items#680,FTP upload>>. Choose image names carefully to avoid mistakes when assigning the images to items. Generally, it is possible to use the item ID or the item number with the file extensions *.jpg* or *.png*.

[#430]
=== Adding cross-selling items

<<item/managing-items#950,Cross-selling>> is a way to offer your customers additional items from your product range that are a necessary extension or reasonable supplement for your customer’s current selection. The right batteries are needed for a torch, for example. A digital camera only makes sense in combination with a memory card that has sufficient capacity. A customer who buys a premium tennis racket is likely to invest in a nice bag to store the racket in. If such connections also exist for your items, you can use the *Cross-selling* option to set up associations between them and benefit from additional sales.

The following requirements have to be met in order for direct *cross-selling items* to be displayed in your online store:

* The category of the cross-selling item has to be activated.
* The items have to be visible in the online store.
* The <<#630, Cross-selling list>> has to be linked to the appropriate container in Ceres.

[[image-cross-selling-settings]]
.Cross-selling items set up

→ The items will be added and displayed in the *Cross-selling items* tab.

You can change the relationship of the cross-selling items in the *Cross-selling items* tab. You can also delete the cross-selling link here.

[#440]
=== Checklist

Use the following checklist to double check the item settings. Work through the checklist once you have carried out all of the previously described settings. This will ensure that your plentymarkets system functions correctly.

[%interactive]
* [ ] ❏ Did you set up the <<#350, catalogue of items>> including all descriptions?
* [ ] ❏ Did you customise the <<#280, item availability>> texts?
* [ ] ❏ Is the <<#370, item availability>> correct?
* [ ] ❏ Did you double check all <<#350, prices and VAT entries>>?
* [ ] ❏ Did you find reasonable <<#430, cross-selling>> links for your items?

=== Checklist

Use the following checklist to double check the settings. Work through the checklist once you have carried out all of the previously described settings. This will ensure that your plentymarkets system functions correctly.

[%interactive]
* [ ] Did you adequately design your <<#610, homepage>>?
* [ ] Do the <<#680, shipping information and shipping costs>> match the settings in the system?
* [ ] Do the <<#670, legal disclosure and privacy policy>> contain all of the necessary information?
* [ ] Read through your terms and conditions carefully and have them checked by a specialist.
* [ ] Place several test orders with different payment methods and shipping settings. Check whether the shipping costs have been calculated correctly by the system.

[#750]
== Setting up automatic processes

This chapter provides information about the settings that need to be carried out in plentymarkets to set up automatic processes before you begin actively working with the system. The system then completes these automatic processes in the background.

In plentymarkets, there are four different tools that help you automate tasks:

* Email templates. plentymarkets uses templates to automatically send emails to your customers later on.
* Event procedures. Specific events in the online store automatically trigger certain procedures.
* Procedure manager. Recurring events can be taken care of automatically by the procedure manager and carried out at specific times.
* Processes. You can only use this menu, if you have installed the tool plentyBase. This menu is intended for experienced plentymarkets users. Processes are therefore not further explained in the quick start.

Learn more about editing a customer data record in the following video tutorial:

[#760]
=== Managing orders

This chapter teaches you how to work with orders in plentymarkets. The goal is to help you understand how automatic processes work and why they are useful.

In plentymarkets, you will see a list of all the orders that were generated on all of the different platforms. No matter where or how a customer purchased an item from you, whether in the online store, on Amazon or in an eBay listing - plentymarkets will always generate a new order in your order folder. You can then edit this order the same way.

Orders all have a status that indicates how much of the fulfilment process has been completed. A new order that contains all of the necessary data but has not been paid for will always receive *status 3 - waiting for payment*. As soon as the payment is received and has been booked by the system, the *status* will change to *5 - cleared for shipping*. The order can now be prepared and shipped. Once you have shipped the items that the customer ordered and paid for, the order will be completed and set to *status 7 - outgoing items booked*.

Every order will at least pass through the statuses 3, 5 and 7. However, orders can also pass through other statuses as well. For example, if an order has already been paid for but you do not have the actual item in stock, then *status 4 - waiting for stock* can be used. If an item has already been cleared for shipping (*status 5*) but has not yet been sent (*status 7*), you can use *status 6* to indicate that the items are being picked and packed.

If a customer pays for the order with a credit card, the order will only remain in status 3 for a short period of time until the incoming payment has been confirmed and the status is set to 5. The status will be changed directly to 5 instead of 3 if you allow your customers to purchase on account. With this payment method, the outgoing items are shipped with an invoice before the incoming payment is received.

[TIP]
.Status options
====
These status options are especially important when configuring event procedures and the procedure manager.
====

[#770]
=== Sending emails automatically

In the chapter <<#10, Initial settings>>, you learned how to create new email templates and edit existing templates. Now you will learn how plentymarkets sends these email templates automatically.

In the menu <<crm/sending-emails#2300, System » Client (store) » Standard » Email » Automatic email>>, you can choose which email template should be sent in specific situations. For example, it makes sense to automatically send the email template *Confirmation of a store order* whenever an order is placed in the online store. As such, select this email template in the line *Order confirmation after checkout*. You can also save other specific order confirmations in this menu. For example, for orders that come from eBay, Amazon or other markets. Furthermore, you can select an email template that sends the customer a new password upon request and another one confirming newsletter registration. We also recommend that you create and use the templates *Customer registration* and *Reminder in case of aborted purchase*.

Of course, you should only select those email templates you have finished editing and that contain your personal header and contact details. If you have not yet entered the necessary information into a template or if you have not finished creating an email template, keep the default setting *do not send*.

[#780]
=== Using event procedures to automate routine jobs

Online stores carry out many routine jobs every day. Processing and editing incoming orders is complex and requires a systematic approach. After having received an order confirmation, customers also appreciate additional emails that provide information about the status of their order.

In plentymarkets, many routine jobs can be carried out automatically with the help of the event procedures found in the menu <<basics/automation/event-procedures#,System » Orders » Event procedures>>. This allows you to operate your online store very efficiently and save time that you can invest in other things.

Two steps need to be carried out to activate an event procedure. First, use various filter options to define an event. Second, decide which procedures the system should carry out when this event occurs. The system will automatically carry out the defined procedure whenever this event occurs in the future.

It is possible to set up any number of different event procedures in plentymarkets. Below, you will find examples for setting up four event procedures that are beneficial to most online stores.

[#790]
==== Example 1: Automatically sending the invoice

Set up an <<basics/automation/event-procedures#,event procedure>> to automatically send the customer an email with the invoice in PDF format as soon as the invoice is generated in the system.

[IMPORTANT]
.Did you create the document template?
====
Make sure that you have created a document template including your bank details for the invoices you send.

If a certain user is selected, this user in your plentymarkets system will receive the email.
====

[#800]
==== Example 2: Automatically sending the partial payment confirmation

Everyone with a little experience in eBusiness likely knows the following problem: Instead of transferring the correct amount of money, the customer has accidentally paid a lower amount. When this happens, you need to notify the customer and ask him or her to transfer the outstanding amount. In plentymarkets, you can define an <<basics/automation/event-procedures#, event procedure>> to automatically process such cases without wasting a lot of time or effort.

====

[TIP]
.Synchronisation is carried out automatically
====
When incoming payments are booked, your plentymarkets system compares the amount paid with the required amount and is therefore able to automatically recognise a *partial payment*.
====

[#810]
==== Example 3: Automatically sending the full payment confirmation for cash in advance

Customers show their trust when they choose the payment method *Cash in advance*. This is because they are theoretically taking some risk. Therefore, it is understandable that customers who choose this payment method will be somewhat impatient while waiting to hear back from you. We recommend that you set up another <<basics/automation/event-procedures#, event procedure>> to automatically respond to this payment method.

==== Example 4: Automatically confirming shipment after package numbers are imported

Online stores have to complete a variety of daily tasks in order to process their orders. The last task is usually shipping packages. The package numbers generated during this process should now be reported back to plentymarkets. This is because the package numbers are used for other event procedures that are necessary for processing orders.

[TIP]
.Tip: Automating the import of package numbers
====
There are several different ways to import package numbers into plentymarkets: You can fill out forms much quicker with the help of a USB scanner. If you process a large number of shipments, we recommend you import these entries from your shipping software into the system.
====

When package numbers are imported, this next <<basics/automation/event-procedure#, event procedure>> sends a shipping confirmation, changes the order status to 7 and books the outgoing items from the warehouse, thus updating the physical stock.

If a certain user is selected, this user in your plentymarkets system will receive the email.
====

Nowadays, nearly all shipping service providers offer customers to track packages online. You already saved a tracking URL while setting up your shipping service providers. Once the package number has been entered, your plentymarkets system has all of the necessary information to send customers a tracking URL for their package. Use this option and make sure that the shipping confirmation email contains the variable *$TrackingURL*. You should also test the first tracking URLs yourself to ensure that they have been processed correctly and that the customer has all the information.

[TIP]
.Tip: Use flags
====
We recommend that you use flags to help you keep track of the orders in your order folder. You will have to define the meaning of the flags yourself and use them consistently afterwards. For example, you can use an event procedure to assign *flag 5* to orders that are partially paid for. Then you will be able to recognise this status right away when you open the order overview later on. Flags can either be saved manually or automatically. Save flags automatically by setting up an event procedure with the procedure type *Change flag*. These flags can be used to filter (select) orders in event procedures and throughout the entire system.

[#830]
=== Using the procedure manager to automate routine jobs

plentymarkets can automatically carry out certain procedures for you with the procedure manager. Two examples will now be used to explain how the procedure manager works. In the first example, you will learn how to set up automatic eBay feedback. In the second example, you will learn how to configure the automatic dunning process.

[#840]
==== Example 1: Automatically posting feedback on eBay

Posting feedback on eBay is a time-consuming, routine job. This is why we are going use the procedure manager to post feedback automatically. Whenever your customer gives you positive feedback, the <<basics/automation/procedure-manager#, procedure manager>> will respond by giving your eBay customer positive feedback as well.

[.instruction]
Using the procedure manager to automatically give feedback on eBay:

. Go to *System » Orders » Events*.
. Click on the *New procedure* tab.
. Place a check mark next to the option *Active* to activate the procedure.
. Select a time from the *Execute every day at* drop-down menu.
. Enter a *Name* for the procedure.
. Click on the *Filter* tab.
. Select the *receive positive feedback* option from the *eBay* drop-down list. +
→ All other options are greyed out
. Click on the *Procedure* tab.
. Select the *give positive feedback* option from the *eBay* drop-down list.
. *Save* the settings.

The procedure has now been set up. However, you still have to write the feedback texts before you can post feedback. Go to <<omni-channel/multi-channel/ebay#65, System » Markets » eBay » Settings » Tab: Account settings>> and enter the texts. plentymarkets will randomly select one of these texts, which will keep your feedback from sounding too repetitious.

[.instruction]
Entering feedback texts for eBay:

. Go to *System » Markets » eBay » Settings*.
. Click on the *Account settings* tab.
. Enter up to four feedback texts in the *Automatic feedback* area.
. *Save* the settings.

[#850]
==== Example 2: Automatically sending payment reminders

Unfortunately, sometimes customers order items on invoice and then forget to pay. In such cases, you should send your customers a reminder email. Use the <<basics/automation/procedure-manager#, procedure manager>> to automate this task.

[.instruction]
Automatically sending the payment reminder email template:

. Go to *System » Orders » Events*.
. Click on the *New procedure* tab. +
→ A new procedure is created. *_Note:_* The procedure is not active yet.
. Select the appropriate *Dunning level* in the *Filter* tab, e.g. *level 0*.
. Select the email template *Payment reminder* in the *Procedure* tab.
. Carry out additional settings as desired. Pay attention to the information given in <<table-settings-procedure-manager-email-reminder>>.
. Place a check mark next to the option *Active* in the *Settings* tab.
. *Save* the settings. +
→ The procedure is active.

[TIP]
.Deactivating the function
====
Remove the check mark next to the option *Active* and save the settings to deactivate the procedure.
====

[[table-settings-procedure-manager-email-reminder]]
.Procedure manager; settings for automatically sending the payment reminder email template
[cols="1,3"]
|====
|Setting |Explanation

2+|Settings

|*Active*
|Place a check mark to activate the procedure.

|*Execute every day at*
|Specify when the procedure should be carried out.

|*Name*
|Enter a name for the procedure. +
Default entry: The date and time it was created. This will not be displayed to the customer.

2+|Filters

|*Status*
|Select *[3] Waiting for payment*.

|*Last status change*
|Select *Enter the days* and enter a number. For example, 8 means that the last status change was 8 days ago. +
This entry is particularly important for reminders or dunning letters. It allows you to ensure that you only include orders that are beyond a due date. +
*Important*: This filter only goes into effect for processes for which a status was saved. It does not go into effect when, e.g., manually booking an incoming payment for which no status has been saved.

|*Incoming payment*
|Select *OPEN*. Only considers orders that have not been paid for yet or orders for which no payment has been booked in the system yet.

2+|Procedure

|*Send email template*
|Select *Payment reminder*.

|*Change dunning level*
|The first email should remind the customer to make a payment. The dunning level should be set to *level 1*. This setting allows you to easily recognise orders that have not yet been paid for, but which have already received a first reminder.
|====

In case your customer fails to pay despite the payment reminder, create another email template that is more strongly worded, e.g. a payment request. Create a new procedure for the second dunning level and use it to send the template. Filter all of the unpaid invoices, i.e. orders that are in *status 3*. Select a longer period of time in the *Last status change* field (e.g. 20 days).

Your last option for dealing with unpaid invoices is to hand the orders over to a <<order-processing/payment#, collection agency>>. plentymarkets also offers a simple solution for taking care of this automatically.

[#860]
=== Checklist

Use the following checklist to double check the settings. Work through the checklist once you have carried out all of the previously described settings. This will ensure that your plentymarkets system functions correctly.

[%interactive]
* [ ] Did you understand how statuses work when <<#760, processing orders>>?
* [ ] Did you edit your <<#770, email templates>> and enter your cancellation rights, bank and contact details?
* [ ] Did you enter the tracking URL correctly into the *Shipping confirmation of order* template?
* [ ] Did you use <<#780, event procedures>> and the <<#830, procedure manager>> to automate routine jobs?

[#1000]
== Final check

Allow enough time for the final check before activating your system. Check whether your plentymarkets system is fully configured and functioning. Several useful notes and suggestions for testing the online store are given below.

[TIP]
.Tip for testing the online store
