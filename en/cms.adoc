This section teaches you how to work with the integrated __**Content Management System**__. It shows you how to edit **templates** and thus customize the design for your online store. Furthermore, you will learn how to use wildcard characters to insert content into your online store. Wildcard characters make it possible to edit the content dynamically. For example, you can use wildcard characters to display item prices and availabilities. Use <<cms-syntax/basics/if#, **if queries**  >> to make case-by-case decisions. Procedures will then be carried out on an if-then basis.

Format your online store with **CSS** and make changes to the design with only a few clicks of the mouse.
