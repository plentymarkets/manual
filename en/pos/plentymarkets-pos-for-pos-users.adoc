==== Return information for POS invoice orders

If customers can buy items on account, customers may want to return items that are part of a partially paid invoice order. In such cases, plentymarkets POS automatically calculates the amount to be paid out to customers. <<table-POS-return-invoice>> shows the calculations that plentymarkets POS performs in the background so that you can explain it to customers if necessary.

[[table-POS-return-invoice]]
.POS invoice returns
[cols="1,3,3"]

|Invoice status |Partial return |Full return

|*Not paid*

A credit note for the returned items is created in the background. +
*_Tipp:_* The invoice amount the customer still needs to pay is shown on the credit note receipt.
|Customer does not receive any money. +
A credit note for the full invoice amount is created in the background.

|*Partially paid*
a|The POS calculates any refund to the customer automatically. The formula is: Unpaid invoice amount minus the price of the returned items.

If the invoice only has been partially paid, the following cases can occur: +

* Returned items cost less than the unpaid invoice amount = The customer does not receive any money. +
The unpaid invoice amount is adjusted (Unpaid invoice amount minus price of the returned items). +
A credit note is created for the price of the returned items. +

* Returned items cost the same as the unpaid invoice amount = The customer does not receive any money. +
A credit note is created for the price of the returned items. +

* Returned items cost more than the unpaid invoice amount = The customer receives the balance of the unpaid invoice amount minus the price of the returned items.  +

A credit note for the returned items is created in the background. Note that the credit note amount and the refunded amount are not always the same. If the refunded amount does not match the credit note amount, the refunded amount is shown on the credit note receipt.

|The customers receives the amount they have already paid. +
The credit note amount is equal to the full invoice amount.

* Document the time the unit stops working.
* If possible, move on to a POS with a functional signature unit.
* If no other POS is available, you can use the POS with the defect signature unit. All receipts are marked *Sicherheitseinrichtung ausgefallen* (Security unit failed).
* Once the signature unit is functional again, a collective receipt is created and printed in plentymarkets POS automatically.

These steps are recommendations that can help you adhere to the RKSV. Check with your supervisor how to proceed if the signature unit fails.

=== Creating a Kontrollbeleg (control receipt) for tax authorities (Austria only)

In the case of a POS inspection by Austrian tax authorities, you need to be able to generate a zero amount control receipt (Kontrollbeleg) on the spot. This control receipt allows tax inspectors to validate the signature on the POS receipts on site in your store using a special app. You do not need any additional user rights to create a control receipt.
