A plugin set is a collection of multiple plugins. These sets can all be managed for one or multiple clients in the *Plugin overview*. They contain one or multiple plugins as well as settings for plugin configuration and layout containers. Plugin sets especially benefit sellers who use plentymarkets to manage multiple online stores at the same time. They can activate and configure different plugin sets for different clients.

The following sections describe how to create new plugin sets, edit plugin sets and delete plugin sets.
