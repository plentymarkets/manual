[TIP]
.Backup
====
Whenever you want to edit a plugin set, either by adding new plugins to the set, updating existing plugins or deleting plugins, it is recommended that you first create a backup of the plugin set and use this backup to implement your changes. This prevents any unforeseen consequences of the changes from affecting your actual store.
