[TIP]
.Batch transferring plugin configurations
====
You can transfer the configurations of all plugins in a plugin set at once. To export or import all configurations, in the *Plugins » Plugin overview* menu, open the *Plugin set settings*. Afterwards, proceed the same way as when exporting and importing individual configurations.

You can also batch export and import configurations when the plugins in a plugin set differ from the ones listed in the configuration export, or if they’re installed in a different version. If any settings don’t exist because of this, they’re skipped.
