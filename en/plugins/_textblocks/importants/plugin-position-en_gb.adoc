.Plugin position
====
A pluginâ€™s relative position determines the order in which plugins of the plugin set are loaded. The rule is that Plugins with a lower position are loaded earlier. Normally, you want to set the IO plugin to the highest position and the Ceres plugin to the second highest. An exception are theme plugins, which are usually placed in-between Ceres and IO.
