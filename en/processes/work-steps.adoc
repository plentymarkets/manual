== Content of this chapter

This chapter deals with the **work steps** that can be configured for **processes** in the **plenty**markets **client**.

You can create and configure as many **work steps** as desired for a process. The possibilities for configuration will be more or less detailed depending on which **type** of work step is selected. These are primarily made up of **procedures** and **sub-procedures** that are carried out one after the other and can either run **endlessly** or be controlled **manually**. You can set up **conditions** that act as filters and make it possible to set up very individual configurations for the work steps.

Select the **type** of work step when you create a new work step.
