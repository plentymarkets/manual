==  Creating properties

The properties described below are required to specify the condition and the shipping information. You can create a <<item/managing-items#490., **property group** >> for Allyouneed and assign all properties you create for Allyouneed to this group. Only options relevant for Allyouneed are described here. For further details, refer to the <<item/managing-items#480., **Managing properties** >> page of the manual.

[#700]
===  Creating a property for condition

The Allyouneed market has a separate section for link:https://portal.allyouneed.com/verkaufen-mit-allyouneed/highlights-vorteile/b-ware.html[**selling factory seconds**, window="_blank"] (B-Ware). You have two possibilities to list there:

*  Go to **Item » Tab: Other » Tab: Others** and select **Factory seconds** in the **Condition for API** drop-down menu.
*  You create a <<item/managing-items#500., **property** >> for the condition. The advantage of creating a property is that the property can be used for other conditions such as **display item**.

If the sale of an item marked as factory second was activated by one of these two possibilities, the fields **EAN**, **Manufacturer** and **Manufacturer number** will no longer be transferred. This prevents mixing factory seconds with normal items in search results.

. **Save** the settings.

[#800]
===  Creating a property for shipping information

[.instruction]

. Go to **Settings » Item » Properties**.
. Click on the **New property** tab.
. Enter a name in the **Back end name** field.
. Select a **Property group**, if available.

→ The property will be created.
