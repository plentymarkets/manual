[#tags]
=== Tags

When hovering over the different main menu items in the back end, you will find several tags. These tags indicate for example that a new menu entry has been added.

The following table lists all existing tags and provides information on their meaning.

|*New* (green)
|A stable functionality of the menu entry is already given. The functionality is either completely new or replaces another one.

|*Test phase* (orange)
|This corresponds to the beta version. The menu entry’s functionality is available, but might be partly limited.

|*Deprecated* (red)
|A menu entry with this tag will soon be replaced by another one or disappear completely. Thus, there is no further development of the existing functionalities.
