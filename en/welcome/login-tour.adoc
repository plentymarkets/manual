Changing the CSS of the editor

The <<online-store/online-store/cms#web-design-tools#, editor>> uses the *CSSContent* by default. If a background image is used there and this is bothersome or not desired, you can individually edit the CSS in the menu *Setup » Settings » Editors » Tab: CSS*. Alternatively, you can use the *Standard* CSS with a white background. You can also create your own *customised* CSS and specify additional formatting, e.g. fonts.

To change the CSS for the editor, go to *Setup » Settings » Editors » Tab: CSS*.

[.instruction]
Changing the CSS of the editor:

. Go to *Setup » Settings » Editors*.
. Click on the *CSS* tab.
. Select the desired CSS. Pay attention to the information given in <<table-css-editors>>.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.
