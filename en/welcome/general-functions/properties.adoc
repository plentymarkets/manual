Properties are used to characterise variations, storage locations and contacts. For example, you can use properties to:

* highlight a variation’s technical features such as Bluetooth or WLAN
* specify which storage locations are appropriate for items requiring refrigeration
* record how customers want to be contacted by you (by email, phone or mail)

Properties are centrally managed in the *Setup » Settings » Properties » Configuration* menu. You can also group multiple properties and create property groups.

Then you link the properties of the corresponding area with variations, storage locations and contacts:

* <<item/managing-items#4900, Linking a variation property and saving a value>>
* <<stock-management/setting-up-a-warehouse#1100, Linking properties with storage locations>>
* <<crm/managing-contacts#970, Linking properties with the contact>>
