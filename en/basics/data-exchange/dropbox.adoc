==  General information about Dropbox

link:https://www.dropbox.com/[Dropbox^] is a cloud service. It allows you to save, share and jointly work on files in the cloud.

You can then exchange data between plentymarkets and your Dropbox account.

==  Functions in plentymarkets

Linking to your Dropbox account allows you to export and import designs in the <<omni-channel/online-store/setting-up-clients/cms#web-design-editing-the-web-design, CMS » Web design>> menu. When exporting designs, files are saved in your Dropbox account in a file structure. Because the files are exported in TXT format, they can also be edited on mobile devices. After editing, you need to import the design into your plentymarkets system for the changes to take effect.

Exporting designs allows you to give a service provider access to your design files via Dropbox without them accessing your system. You can manage access rights in the settings of your Dropbox account. If necessary, a file history allows you to revert to previous versions of a file.
