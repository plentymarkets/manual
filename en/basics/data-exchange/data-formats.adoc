:description: Learn which data formats are available in plentymarkets for dynamic import and export.
:position: 30

On this page of the manual, you will find a list of all data formats that are available in your plentymarkets system as well as a short description. Most of these data formats can be used for both export and import. First, you create the formats in the **Data exchange » Export » Dynamic export** menu. Then you export the formats to edit them. Finally, you import the formats back to your system. To do so, go to **Data exchange » Import » Dynamic import**.

Using these export formats, you can export item, customer, order and sales data, for example. Go to <<order-processing/orders/_accounting#, **Settings » Client (store) » Standard » Locations » Select location » Accounting**  >> and enter all of your accounting data before exporting your sales data. This has to be done in order for plentymarkets to generate the **<<order-processing/orders/_accounting#, posting keys  >>**.

Table 1 lists all data formats that are available in plentymarkets. If not stated otherwise, you can use the data formats for both import and export.

On the sub-page of each data format, you will find a list of the data fields and their explanation as well as possible filter options and procedures. Furthermore, information about mandatory fields and mandatory synchronisation fields can be found there.

[IMPORTANT]

Make sure that you adhere to the correct spelling. Otherwise the data cannot be processed. +
Mandatory fields must be available and a valid value must be entered. Mandatory synchronisation fields must be set for data synchronisation. For some synchronisation fields, alternative fields are available.
