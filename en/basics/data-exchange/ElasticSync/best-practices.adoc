== Best Practice: Creating variations with ElasticSync

This best practice teaches you how to create items using ElasticSync. To benefit from this best practice, you should be familiar functionality of ElasticSync. For general information, check the user manual of the plugin in the link:https://marketplace.plentymarkets.com/en/plugins/integration/ElasticSync_4750[Marketplace^]. Our link:https://knowledge.plentymarkets.com/basics/datenaustausch/export-import/daten-importieren#1000[manual^] also offers information on ElasticSync.

[#requirements]
=== Requirements

To import items and variations using ElasticSync as described here, the following data must be saved in the system:

* Attributes
* Attribute values
* Categories
* Sales prices

[#infos]
=== Info

Go to *System » Settings » ElasticSync* to find the button *Delete cache*.

This buttons allows you to reset the ElasticSync cache one per hour in order to reimport a file without any changes.

Also helpful is the *Test run* button.

.Useful for testing syncs

 

This imports the first 10 rows of a file without cache. This allows you to check if all values have been assigned correctly before you start syncing all rows.

Check the plugin description and the manual to find out which values are valid for these fields.

Error messages for the sync are shown in the *Data » Log* menu.


[#structure_of_file]
=== Structure of the file

The following link:https://plenty-item.plentymarkets-cloud02.com/ElasticSync/BestPracticeArticleSync.csv[example file^] was used for the sync.

==== General

The data that is saved *globally* at the item level, e.g. *the name, the description, etc.* is saved to the row of the main variation. During the sync, this should be saved in a separate mapping.

Data that is *variation based* must be entered into the relevant rows of the variations.

When creating the variations, it is important that the structure of the attributes and values are saved in the file matches that of the mapping.

==== Variation numbers

In this example, we will create a main variation with 4 variations. For mapping the variations, we use the main variation number.

Because the sync imports data row by row, the main variation is at the top of the file.

There, we manually save the variation number in the field of the same name. The field *Main variation number* remains empty.

This variation number is now written into the field *Main variation number* of the variations in order to map them to the main variation. Otherwise, the variations would be imported as separate main variations.

You can also enter the variation numbers of the child variations. If you leave the field empty, the system generates the numbers automatically.

The file will look like this:

.Entering the numbers for main variation and variations

 

[WARNING]
.Variation numbers must be unique!
====
Both the number of the main variation and those of the child variations must be unique. The import fails if numbers are assigned more than once.
====

==== Attributes

In our example, we selected *attribute selection combination*:

.Creating variations using the attribute selection combination

 

The first row of the main variation has not been assigned a combination so it is not linked to any attributes.

[TIP]
.Main variation without attributes
====
If you work with variation items, we recommend that you do not assign any attributes to the main variation. This provides you with more flexibility when you create variations. If you assign an attribute to the main variation, you can only create variations with the same attributes.
====

==== Images

In our sync, we will import the image URLs using 2 separate columns and mappings. You can also do this in one row by comma-separating the URLs.
For that, the field *Multi URL* must be selected in the mapping. The format of the URL is saved as follows: *image1url;positionImage1,image2url;positionImage2*

==== Category links

To link more than one category, you need to create several mappings. Also, make sure to specify the full path for the category links. The levels are separated by a semicolon.

.Correct spelling of separators and paths are essential for the import.

 


[WARNING]
.Mapping and file
====
Make sure that the values in the file match the mapping. This is because you can select different values in the mapping. For example, for the field Default category, you can select either the ID or the name. As such, the CSV file must contain either the ID or the name. You cannot use the ID in the mapping but the name in the file.
====

[#synchronisation]
=== Synchronisation

For the synchronisation, it is important that a variation-specific synchronisation field is used. A good choice is the variation number or the variation ID.

Select the option to create a new data record if no synchronisation is possible.


[#mappings]
=== Mapping

In the mapping, we map the fields in the CSV file with the fields in plentymarkets.

.You need to create a mapping

image::basics/data-exchange/ElasticSync/assets/set_values.png[]

We recommend that you only map those fields that you actually want to import. Unnecessary fields can result in errors and should best be avoided.

There are some mandatory fields for creating items with variations. These fields must be mapped for the sync to work. Those mandatory fields are:

* Default category
* Main variation number
* Variation number
* If you want to import stock, the following values must be part of the mapping:
Warehouse, Quantity, Storage location


[#second_mapping]
=== Second mapping

The mappings are processed one after other. That means that the second mapping runs after the first one.

Using an additional mapping, we now want to import a second category, an additional image and the global item data (e.g. name, description, etc.).

In the mapping itself, we again specify the values and map the URL and the name of the category to the second column of our file.

.Additional mappings are created in the same way as the first one.

 

The sync is now ready to go and you can start it.

[TIP]
.Test run
====
We recommend that you do a test run before the first sync. This allows you to check if the sync functions as expected. If the sync does not perform as expected, you can now correct it before it is run for real.
====


== Best Practice: Exporting and importing client links

[#export_client_links]
=== Exporting client availability

==== Creating the format in the FormatDesigner

The clients currently linked to variations, i.e. active clients, can be exported using the FormatDesigner. To do so, go to *Data » FormatDesigner* and create a new format of the type *Item*.

After that, select the data fields:

* To allow mapping during import, from the *Variation* area select the *ID* or the *Number* of the variation.

* The actual client availability is then added in the *VariationClient* area. The field is called *isActive*.


[WARNING]
.Mapping for multiple clients
====
If you work with more than one client, the field *isActive* must be added more than once. Each field must be assigned to a specific client.
====

In the export, the field contains the value 1 if the client is active. If the client is not active, an empty field is exported.

After you have saved the format, you can set up the export in the elastic export.

==== Setting up the export in the elastic export

Go to *Data » Elastic export* to set up the export of the format you created.

To do so, click on *New export* and save a name, the type *Item*, the format you created, a limit and a file name.

[TIP]
.Exporting the file in CSV format
====
If you want to download the file in CSV format, specify the suffix *.csv* as part of the file name.
====

Once you save the format, you are done setting it up.

==== Exporting data

There are several ways of exporting the data:

* In the export, click *Download*.
* Open the URL in a browser.
* In the export overview, click *Download*.

[#import_client_availability]
=== Importing the client availability

==== Creating the format in ElasticSync

To import the client availability, you can go to *Data » ElasticSync* and create a sync of the type *Item*. Alternatively, you can add the fields to an existing sync.

The synchronisation must be based on a variation-specific field, for example the *Variation number*.

In the sync’s mapping, select the field *Active* in the *Client (store)* area. Then click on the green plus icon to add the clients. To map the column of the CSV file, click on the pencil icon.

You need to specify the value 1 to activate. To deactivate, specify a 0.

[TIP]
.Working with your own values
====
Instead of using one column in the file, you can also use your *own value* and enter *yes* or *no* for all rows of the file in the mapping.
====

That is all you need for the link. The sync is now ready to go and you can start activating or deactivating clients.

== Best Practice: Exporting and importing property links

[#export_property_links]
=== Exporting property links

==== Creating the format in the FormatDesigner

The properties currently linked to variations can be exported using the FormatDesigner. To do so, go to *Data » FormatDesigner* and create a new format of the type *Item*.

After that, select the data fields:

* To allow mapping during import, from the *Item* area select the *ID* of the item or from the *Variation* area select the *ID* or the *Number* of the variation.

* You then add the actual property links in the *VariationProperty* area:

You can select between 3 values:

- *value*: Returns the value of the property mapped in the format.
- *all*: Returns all linked properties of an item with values.
- *allIds*: Returns all linked property IDs of an item without any values.

After you have saved the format, you can set up the export in the elastic export.

==== Setting up the export in the elastic export

Go to *Data » Elastic export* to set up the export of the format you created.

To do so, click on *New export* and save a name, the type *Item*, the format you created, a limit and a file name.

[TIP]
.Exporting the file in CSV format
====
If you want to download the file in CSV format, specify the suffix *.csv* as part of the file name.
====

Once you save the format, you are done setting it up.

==== Exporting data

There are several ways of exporting the data:

* In the export, click *Download*.
* Open the URL in a browser.
* In the export overview, click *Download*.

[#import_property_links]
=== Importing property links

==== Creating the format in ElasticSync

To import the property links, you can go to *Data » ElasticSync* and create a sync of the type *Item*. Alternatively, you can add the fields to an existing sync.

The synchronisation can be based on a variation-specific field, for example the *Variation number*, or based on the *item ID* if the links are created using a separate sync.

In the mapping of the sync, you can select different fields to create or edit the links. For example, you can add the fields *ID, Value and Language* (you need to add all 3 fields) or instead the field *Property combination*. The latter must be structured as follows in the file:

*InternalName1:Value1:Language;InternalName2:Value2:Language*

If you want to delete property links, use the field *Delete (Yes/No)*. In the file, the value *1* must be specified if the links are to be deleted. Specify the value *0* if you do not want to delete the link.

That is all you need for the link. The sync is now ready to go and you can start linking properties.


== Best Practice: Exporting and importing cross-selling links

[#export_CrossSelling]
=== Exporting cross-selling links

==== Creating the format in the FormatDesigner

The currently linked cross-selling items can be exported using the FormatDesigner.

To do so, go to *Data » FormatDesigner* and create a new format of the type *Item*.

After that, select the data fields:

* To allow mapping during import, from the *Item* area select the *ID* of the item or from the *Variation* area select the *ID* or the *Number* of the variation.

* The actual cross-selling links are added in the *ItemCrossSelling* area. The field *all* returns all linked cross-selling items in the format *ItemID:Type:IsDynamic*.

After you have saved the format, you can set up the export in the elastic export.

==== Setting up the export in the elastic export

Go to *Data » Elastic export* to set up the export of the format you created.

To do so, click on *New export* and save a name, the type *Item*, the format you created, a limit and a file name.

[TIP]
.Exporting the file in CSV format
====
If you want to download the file in CSV format, specify the suffix *.csv* as part of the file name.
====

Once you save the format, you are done setting it up.

==== Exporting data

There are several ways of exporting the data:

* In the export, click *Download*.
* Open the URL in a browser.
* In the export overview, click *Download*.

[#Import_CrossSelling]
=== Importing cross-selling links

==== Creating the format in ElasticSync

To import the cross-selling links, you can go to *Data » ElasticSync* and create a sync of the type *Item*. Alternatively, you can add the fields to an existing sync.

* The synchronisation can be based on a variation-specific field, for example the *Variation number*, or based on the item ID if the links are imported using a separate sync.

* In the sync’s mapping, in the *Cross-selling* are, link the field *Add cross-selling links* and assign the corresponding column in the CSV file.

* You can save more than one cross-selling link per row. The structure will be as follows:

*ItemID:Type;ItemID2:Type2*

* Use the field *Delete all cross-selling links* to delete all links of an item. Specify 1 for yes, 0 for no. This is a good idea if, for example, you want to update your cross-selling items.

* Using the field *Delete cross-selling links*, you can delete one or more item IDs. The format should look like this:

*itemID;itemID;etc*

That is all you need for the link. The sync is now ready to go and you can start linking or unlinking cross-selling items.

== Best Practice: Exporting and importing ASIN and ePID

[#export_ASIN_ePID]
=== Exporting ASIN and ePID

==== Creating the format in the FormatDesigner

The ASINs and ePIDs currently linked to variations can be exported using the FormatDesigner. To do so, go to *Data » FormatDesigner* and create a new format of the type *Item*.

After that, select the data fields:

* To allow mapping during import, from the *Variation* area select the *ID* or the *Number* of the variation.

* The actual links are added in the *VariationMarketIdentNumber* area.

You can select 3 values:

- *countryID*: Returns the ID of the country.
- *type*: Returns the type, i.e. ASIN or ePID.
- *value*: Returns the value that was saved for the ASIN or ePID.

The type has to be mapped for all 3 fields. As such, if you want to export all ASINs and ePIDs, every field must be added to the format twice.

After you have saved the format, you can set up the export in the elastic export.

==== Setting up the export in the elastic export

Go to *Data » Elastic export* to set up the export of the format you created.

To do so, click on *New export* and save a name, the type *Item*, the format you created, a limit and a file name.

[TIP]
.Exporting the file in CSV format
====
If you want to download the file in CSV format, specify the suffix *.csv* as part of the file name.
====

Once you save the format, you are done setting it up.

==== Exporting data

There are several ways of exporting the data:

* In the export, click *Download*.
* Open the URL in a browser.
* In the export overview, click *Download*.

[#import_ASIN_ePID]
=== Importing ASIN and ePID

==== Creating the format in ElasticSync

To import and edit the ASINs and ePIDs, you can go to *Data » ElasticSync* and create a sync of the type *Item*. Alternatively, you can add the fields to an existing sync.

* The synchronisation must be based on a variation-specific field, for example the *Variation number*.

* To *map* the sync, in the *ASIN/ePID* area the fields *Country*, *Type* and *Value* must be saved and linked to the columns in the CSV file.

* You need to save the ID of the country and the type must be either ASIN or ePID.

That is all you need for the link. The sync is now ready to go and you can start linking properties.
