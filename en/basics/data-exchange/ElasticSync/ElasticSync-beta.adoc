:position: 10

This page of the manual describes how to import data using ElasticSync. Importing data is recommended if you want to add new items, customer data or stock etc. to your plentymarkets system and you already have this data available in digital format. ElasticSync allows to carry out data imports by creating so-called syncs. You can import your data manually or automatically.

[#1210]
== Creating a sync

The steps for creating and importing syncs are identical for all sync types. As such, the steps described in the following apply to all sync types.

Go to **Data » ElasticSync** to create, edit and manage syncs. Here, you can see an overview of all syncs. With a sync, you can assign the data of a file that is accessible via FTP or HTTP to the data in plentymarkets and import them. When creating a sync, you save information about the data source. Furthermore, it is important that you determine data for the matching and that you assign which data of your file corresponds to the data in plentymarkets. Use the matching to set what data is to be used to try to identify if a data record already exists or not. Use the mapping to set which column in your file corresponds to which data field in plentymarkets. In the end, set an import interval. Proceed as described below to create a sync.

[NOTE]
.Set the import interval in the end to avoid that a sync is carried out too early
====
It is recommended to set the import interval in the end. By doing so, you avoid that a sync is already carried out while you still carry out matching and mapping settings.
====

[.instruction]

== Setting the import options

The import options can be found in the *Matching* area. The import options apply both for the matching and for the mapping.

[.instruction]
Setting the import options:

. Go to *Data » ElasticSync*.
. Click on the sync within the sync overview.
. Click on *Matching*.
. Determine the import options. Pay attention to the information given in <<table-sync-import-options>>.
. *Save* the settings.

[[table-sync-import-options]]
.Import options for syncs
[cols="1,2"]
|====
|Import option |Explanation

|*If no data matched*
a|Select *Skip* or *Create*.

* *Import new data, update existing* = If data can be found by means of the matching fields, a new data record, e.g. a new item or a new order, is added. At the same time, existing data is updated.
* *Only update existing data* = Existing data is updated. If no data can be found by means of the matching fields, the data record is not imported.
* *Only import new data* = Only new data records are imported, i.e. any data for which no matching data is found based on the synchronisation fields.

|*Decimal number*
a|Select *German spelling* or *English spelling*.

* *German spelling* = Decimal numbers are separated by a comma and a full stop serves as thousands separator.
* *English spelling* = Decimal numbers are separated by a full stop and a comma serves as thousands separator.

|*Data format*
|Enter the date format. If the date in the file corresponds to the standard format Y-m-d H:i:s, it is not necessary to enter another format. Other formats, however, must be entered here. All link:http://php.net/manual/en/function.date.php[php-compliant date formats^] are allowed.

|====

[#1400]
== Setting the matching

After you created a sync, open it to carry out further settings. First, you select the fields that should be used for matching the data. Determine what should happen if no existing data can be found during the matching process.

[NOTE]
.Matching is optional
====
Matching fields are optional settings. If you do not select a matching field, the data in your file cannot be assigned to existing data in your system. You can determine one, multiple or all matching fields. The displayed matching fields are different for each sync type.
====

[.instruction]
Setting the matching:

. Go to *Data » ElasticSync*.
. Click on the sync within the sync overview.
. Click on *Matching*.
. Carry out the settings.
. *Save* the settings.

[#1500]
== Creating the mapping

With a mapping, you specify which column of your file corresponds to which data field in your system. Without this mapping, no data can be imported.

[.instruction]
Determining the mapping:

. Go to *Data » ElasticSync*.
. Click on the sync within the sync overview.
. Click on *Mapping*.
. Click on *Add mapping*.
. Enter a name for the mapping.
. Enter a position for the mapping (optional).
. *Save* the settings. +
→ The available mapping fields differ according to the sync type.
. Select the data fields for the mapping by placing a checkmark in the fields. +
→ The selected data fields are added to the mapping.
. Select a column from your file for each data field or select the option *Own value*.
. *Save* the settings.

[NOTE]
.Own value
====
The option *Own value* allows to import a fix value for the data field. This fix value is thus identical for each data record that is imported via this sync.
====

[#1600]
== Filtering import data

You can use filters to limit the data to be imported. You find the filters in the *Mapping* area.

[NOTE]
.Multiple filters are linked with an AND condition
====
If you use multiple filters, only those data records are imported that correspond with all filters. Thus, the filters are linked with an AND condition.
====

[.instruction]
Adding the filter:

. Go to *Data » ElasticSync*.
. Click on the sync within the sync overview. +
. Click on *Mapping*. +
→ An overview of the mapping is displayed.
. Open the mapping.
. Click on *Filter* in the toolbar.
. Select the column from your file that you would like to filter.
. Select an operator.
. Enter a value.
. Click on *Add filter*. +
→ The filter is saved.
. Add additional filters as necessary. +
→ Only data that meets all filter criteria is imported.


[#1620]
== Viewing the sync logs

Log entries are created for each sync that is carried out. You can view these log entries.

[.instruction]
Viewing the sync logs:

. Go to *Data » ElasticSync*.
. Click on *History*. +
→ The sync logs are displayed.

[#1630]
== Copying syncs

It is possible to copy one sync or multiple syncs at the same time. In this way, you can use syncs that you have already configured in order to quickly create a new sync.

[.instruction]
Copying syncs:

. Go to *Data » ElasticSync*.
. Activate one or multiple syncs.
. Click on *Copy sync*. +
→ The sync is copied. *(copy)* is added behind a copied sync.

[#1640]
== Exporting and importing a sync

You can import and export syncs. Furthermore, you can save syncs locally and import syncs from other users.

[.instruction]
Exporting and importing a sync:

. Go to *Data » ElasticSync*.
. Activate one or multiple syncs.
. Click on *Export sync*. +
→ The sync is automatically downloaded.
. Click on *Import sync*. +
→ The option *Import sync* is expanded below the menu.
. Click on *Select file*. +
→ The file browser opens.
. Click on *Upload file* and select the file.
. Place a checkmark next to the file that you would like to upload and click on *Select*. +
→ The file is added.
. Click on *Import*. +
→ The sync is imported.

[NOTE]
.Importing syncs from another plentymarkets system
====
If you would like to import syncs from another plentymarkets system, you have to adjust the matching and mapping settings. It is only possible to import *.json* files.
====

[#1700]
== Testing the sync and importing data

It is possible to test and carry out syncs. Testing allows you to quickly know whether your file can be imported correctly.

[NOTE]
.Testing the sync
====
If you select *Test sync*, only the first ten lines of the import file are imported.
====

[#1720]
== Activating/deactivating mappings

If you manage several mappings in the same sync, you can deactivate or activate specific mappings of the sync in the mapping overview using "activate-mapping". New mappings are active by default.

= Sync types

[#1900]
== Item

With syncs of the type *Item*, you import item and variation data.

In order to import item data via ElasticSync, the following data records must be present in plentymarkets:

* Categories (*Item » Categories* menu)
* Sales prices (*System » Item » Sales prices*)

In order to import variation data with attributes via ElasticSync, the following data records must be present in plentymarkets:

* Attributes and attribute values (*System » Item » Attributes* menu)

Example 1: Price and stock synchronisation of a variation.

Create a sync to keep prices and stock of a variation up-to-date. Once the assignment for the sync took place, a mapping has to be created. To do so, select the plentymarkets fields VariationSalesPrice and VariationStock within the Select values area of the mapping. Next, select the sales prices (price, RRP) which should be updated for VariationSalesPrice. It is possible to update several different sales prices with one sync. Now link the filed of the data source. Not only can you select the warehouse for the stock but also the storage location. For VariationStock, select the warehouse for which stock should be booked. Optionally, select the storage location. To use the quantity from the data source, link the plentymarkets field quantity with the field of the data source. A stock correction is always carried out in the process.

[.subhead]
Example 2: Importing item descriptions

Name, technical data and meta keywords should be imported for an item. First, select these plentymarkets fields within the Select values area of the mapping. Next, you have to select the language for this item descriptions. You can select more than one option. The fields Name, Technical data and Meta keywords are linked with the desired fields of the data source. This means that the entries listed in the data source will be now imported for the previously selected plentymarkets fields. In addition, use the filter options to further specify the import. For example, import the item descriptions only for items that belong to a specific brand.

== Contacts, companies and addresses

Requirements:

* In order that the newly imported or updated countries of delivery are displayed in a contact data record in the contact overview, these countries of delivery must be activated in the *System » Orders » Shipping » Options » Tab: Countries of delivery* menu.

With syncs of the type *Contacts, companies and addresses*, you import new contact data or update existing data records. This data is for example the delivery address and invoice address, the date of birth of the contact, the customer type, contact options such as the private or business email address as well as company data.

In order to import contact data via ElasticSync, the following data records must be present in plentymarkets:

* Contacts (*CRM » Contacts* menu)
* contact options such as telephone number and email address, if necessary
* address data (invoice address, delivery address), if necessary
* company data such as VAT number and payment due date, if necessary

[#2210]
