:position: 20

This page of the manual describes the different options of data import in plentymarkets. Especially, the possibilities of the ElasticSync plugin are explained. ElasticSync allows to import data manually as well as to automate data import in regular intervals.
Furthermore, the possibilities of manual data import via the dynamic import is described. Importing data is recommended if you want to add new items, customer data or stock etc. to your plentymarkets system and you already have this data available in digital format.

[#1000]
== Importing data via ElasticSync

ElasticSync allows to carry out data imports by creating so-called syncs. You can import your data manually or automatically. You can download the ElasticSync plugin free of charge from the link:https://marketplace.plentymarkets.com/en/plugins/integration/ElasticSync_4750[plentyMarketplace^].

[#1100]
=== General description: Importing data via a sync

Basically, creating and importing syncs works identical for all sync types. This is why the procedure described in the following applies to all sync types. Following the general description, you can find a detailed description of each sync type.

[#1200]
==== Creating a sync

Go to **Data » ElasticSync** to create, edit and manage syncs. Here, you can see an overview of all syncs. With a sync, you can assign the data of a file that is accessible via FTP or HTTP to the data in plentymarkets and import them. When creating a sync, you save information about the data source. Furthermore, it is important that you determine data for the matching and that you assign which data of your file corresponds to the data in plentymarkets. Use the matching to set what data is to be used to try to identify if a data record already exists or not. Use the mapping to set which column in your file corresponds to which data field in plentymarkets. In the end, set an import interval. Proceed as described below to create a sync.

[NOTE]
.Set the import interval in the end to avoid that a sync is carried out too early
====
It is recommended to set the import interval in the end. By doing so, you avoid that a sync is already carried out while you still carry out matching and mapping settings.
====

[.instruction]
Creating a sync:

. Go to *Data » ElasticSync*.
. Click on *Add sync*. +
    → The editing area *New sync* is displayed.
. Carry out the settings. Pay attention to the information given in <<table-create-sync>>.
. *Save* the settings. +
    → The sync is created and the matching settings of the sync open.

[[table-sync-import-options]]
.Import options for syncs
[cols="1,2"]
|====
|Import option |Explanation

|*If no data matched*
a|Select *Skip* or *Create*.

* *Skip* = If no data can be found by means of the matching fields, the data record is not imported.
* *Create* = If data can be found by means of the matching fields, a new data record, e.g. a new item or a new order, is added.

|*Decimal number*
a|Select *German spelling* or *English spelling*.

* *German spelling* = Decimal numbers are separated by a comma and a full stop serves as thousands separator.
* *English spelling* = Decimal numbers are separated by a full stop and a comma serves as thousands separator.

|*Data format*
|Enter the date format. If the date in the file corresponds to the standard format Y-m-d H:i:s, it is not necessary to enter another format. Other formats, however, must be entered here. All link:http://php.net/manual/en/function.date.php[php-compliant date formats^] are allowed.

|====

[#1400]
==== Setting the matching

After you created a sync, open it to carry out further settings. First, you select the fields that should be used for matching the data. Determine what should happen if no existing data can be found during the matching process.

[NOTE]
.Matching is optional
====
Matching fields are optional settings. If you do not select a matching field, the data in your file cannot be assigned to existing data in your system. You can determine one, multiple or all matching fields. The displayed matching fields are different for each sync type.
====

[.instruction]
Setting the matching:

. Go to *Data » ElasticSync*.
. Click on the sync within the sync overview.
. Click on *Matching*.
. Carry out the settings.
. *Save* the settings.

[#1500]
==== Creating the mapping

With a mapping, you specify which column of your file corresponds to which data field in your system. Without this mapping, no data can be imported.

[.instruction]
Determining the mapping:

. Go to *Data » ElasticSync*.
. Click on the sync within the sync overview.
. Click on *Mapping*.
. Click on *Add mapping*.
. Enter a name for the mapping.
. Enter a position for the mapping (optional).
. *Save* the settings. +
→ The available mapping fields differ according to the sync type.
. Select the data fields for the mapping by placing a checkmark in the fields. +
→ The selected data fields are added to the mapping.
. Select a column from your file for each data field or select the option *Own value*.
. *Save* the settings.

[NOTE]
.Own value
====
The option *Own value* allows to import a fix value for the data field. This fix value is thus identical for each data record that is imported via this sync.
====

[#1600]
==== Filtering import data

You can use filters to limit the data to be imported. You find the filters in the *Mapping* area.

[NOTE]
.Multiple filters are linked with an AND condition
====
If you use multiple filters, only those data records are imported that correspond with all filters. Thus, the filters are linked with an AND condition.
====

[.instruction]
Adding the filter:

. Go to *Data » ElasticSync*.
. Click on the sync within the sync overview. +
. Click on *Mapping*. +
→ An overview of the mapping is displayed.
. Open the mapping.
. Click on *Filter* in the toolbar.
. Select the column from your file that you would like to filter.
. Select an operator.
. Enter a value.
. Click on *Add filter*. +
→ The filter is saved and you can add further filters.

[#1620]
=== Viewing the sync logs

Log entries are created for each sync that is carried out. You can view these log entries.

[.instruction]
Viewing the sync logs:

. Go to *Data » ElasticSync*.
. Click on *History*. +
→ The sync logs are displayed.

[#1630]
=== Copying syncs

It is possible to copy one sync or multiple syncs at the same time. In this way, you can use syncs that you have already configured in order to quickly create a new sync.

[.instruction]
Copying syncs:

. Go to *Data » ElasticSync*.
. Activate one or multiple syncs.
. Click on *Copy sync*. +
→ The sync is copied. *(copy)* is added behind a copied sync.

[#1640]
=== Exporting and importing a sync

You can import and export syncs. Furthermore, you can save syncs locally and import syncs from other users.

[.instruction]
Exporting and importing a sync:

. Go to *Data » ElasticSync*.
. Activate one or multiple syncs.
. Click on *Export sync*. +
→ The sync is automatically downloaded.
. Click on *Import sync*. +
→ The option *Import sync* is expanded below the menu.
. Click on *Select file*. +
→ The file browser opens.
. Click on *Upload file* and select the file.
. Place a checkmark next to the file that you would like to upload and click on *Select*. +
→ The file is added.
. Click on *Import*. +
→ The sync is imported.

[NOTE]
.Importing syncs from another plentymarkets system
====
If you would like to import syncs from another plentymarkets system, you have to adjust the matching and mapping settings. It is only possible to import *.json* files.
====

[#1700]
=== Testing the sync and importing data

It is possible to test and carry out syncs. Testing allows you to quickly know whether your file can be imported correctly.

[NOTE]
.Testing the sync
====
If you select *Test sync*, only the first ten lines of the import file are imported.
====

[#1710]
=== REST API

In order to use ElasticSync via REST API, the following REST calls are available:

* Creating a sync: POST - /rest/elasticsync/sync/{syncId}/import
* Listing all syncs: GET - /rest/elasticsync/all_syncs

[#1900]
=== Setting up a sync of the Item type

With syncs of the type *Item*, you import item and variation data.

Example 1: Price and stock synchronisation of a variation.

Create a sync to keep prices and stock of a variation up-to-date. Once the assignment for the sync took place, a mapping has to be created. To do so, select the plentymarkets fields VariationSalesPrice and VariationStock within the Select values area of the mapping. Next, select the sales prices (price, RRP) which should be updated for VariationSalesPrice. It is possible to update several different sales prices with one sync. Now link the filed of the data source. Not only can you select the warehouse for the stock but also the storage location. For VariationStock, select the warehouse for which stock should be booked. Optionally, select the storage location. To use the quantity from the data source, link the plentymarkets field quantity with the field of the data source. A stock correction is always carried out in the process.

[.subhead]
Example 2: Importing item descriptions

Name, technical data and meta keywords should be imported for an item. First, select these plentymarkets fields within the Select values area of the mapping. Next, you have to select the language for this item descriptions. You can select more than one option. The fields Name, Technical data and Meta keywords are linked with the desired fields of the data source. This means that the entries listed in the data source will be now imported for the previously selected plentymarkets fields. In addition, use the filter options to further specify the import, e.g. import the item descriptions only for items that belong to a specific brand.

[#2200]
=== Setting up a sync of the Contacts, companies and addresses type

Requirements for using the plugin:

* The Elastic export plugin must be installed and deployed in Productive.
* In order that the newly imported or updated countries of delivery are displayed in a contact data record in the contact overview, these countries of delivery must be activated in the *System » Orders » Shipping » Options » Tab: Countries of delivery* menu.

With syncs of the type *Contacts, companies and addresses*, you import new contact data or update existing data records. This data is for example the delivery address and invoice address, the date of birth of the contact, the customer type, contact options such as the private or business email address as well as company data.

In order to import contact data via ElasticSync, the following data records must be present in plentymarkets:

* Contacts (*CRM » Contacts* menu)
* contact options such as telephone number and email address, if necessary
* address data (invoice address, delivery address), if necessary
* company data such as VAT number and payment due date, if necessary

[#2210]

== Importing data with the dynamic import

It is possible to import a maximum of 6,000 data records at once. +
In the last chapters of this page of the manual, you can find practical examples.





[#10]
== Creating data formats

The data format that you want to import must correspond with the configuration of the data format in plentymarkets. This ensures that your data is assigned correctly. This also includes that the spelling of the data fields matches the spelling in plentymarkets. You find the names of the data fields on the sub-pages of the <<basics/data-exchange/data-formats#, Data formats>> page of the manual. Pay attention to the information about mandatory fields and matching fields. You can create the import file with the help of a spreadsheet program.

You can facilitate this work step considerably by exporting the data format in a file in advance. Then you edit your data in the file and re-import it into your system. This procedure is only possible for data formats that are suitable for both import and export. For further information about handling export and import files, refer to the chapter <<basics/data-exchange/exporting-data#05, Customising a file for data exchange>> on the <<basics/data-exchange/exporting-data#, Exporting data>> page of the manual. Proceed as described below to export your data in a file:

[.instruction]
Creating a data format:

. Go to *Data » Dynamic export*.
. Click on the *New data format* tab.
. Select a *Data format type* from the drop-down list.
. If needed, change the *Data format name* that is automatically created.
. Activate the data fields that should be contained in the export file.
. Select an *import procedure* per data field. +
→ Information about the matching fields can be found on the sub-pages of the <<basics/data-exchange/data-formats#, Data formats>> page of the manual.
. If needed, select *Filters* or *Procedures*.
. *Save* the data format. +
→ The order of the data fields will change according to the values in the *Position* column.

[#25]
[TIP]
.Matching and mapping
====
For the data fields of a data format, the import procedures *Synchronisation* and *Import* are available.  +
With the setting *Import*, the data is imported regardless of whether data is already available in the system or not. This means that data might be overwritten during the import. With the setting *Synchronisation*, the data field is synchronised with the data that is already available in the system before the import is carried out. This means that data is only imported if no data is available in the system at all.
====

[#20]
== Carrying out the dynamic import

The dynamic data import takes place within the *Data exchange » Import » Dynamic import* menu. Here, you can import either data formats that you created in the *Data exchange » Export » Dynamic export* menu (so called customer formats) or data formats that you created yourself. In addition to the customer formats, two special import formats are available in the *Data » Dynamic import* menu in the drop-down menu *Format*:

* the *ItemParcelServicePreset* special format that you use to import shipping profiles
* the *IncomingItems* special format that you use to import incoming items

The special formats are import formats and are therefore only available in the *Data exchange » Import » Dynamic import* menu. You import the special formats exactly the same way as you import the other data formats. How to import data formats is described in the following.

[NOTE]
.Check and adjust names in the column headers
====
If you want to import data from an external system or a file that you created yourself, the column headers in the file must exactly match the spelling of the data fields (field names) in plentymarkets. +
If plentymarkets cannot assign the import to the selected export type, the import is cancelled and an error message is displayed. You find the error message in the *Processing status* area. Check the column headers that are listed in the file to be imported and make changes to these headers if necessary.

.processing status
====
After you have imported the file, you receive a message in the *Processing status* area. In case the data lines were successfully imported, the number of the imported lines is displayed. If an error occurs, the entry *0* is displayed along with an error message. Check the field separator or encoding of the file. The file should always be UTF-8 encoded.
====

Note that the available settings depend on the data format you have selected for the import. For the data format *Stock* e.g., you select a *warehouse* and the *barcode* instead of a mapping option. The settings as they are described in <<table-settings-menu-data-dynamic-import>> are displayed for most of the data formats.

== Importing eBay listings

You import eBay listing in the *Data » eBay listings* menu. Both a set of item master data and a listing are created in plentymarkets. The *Processing status* area gives you access to the current status of the process during import. How to import listings is described on the <<omni-channel/multi-channel/ebay/ebay-setup#, eBay>> page of the manual in the <<omni-channel/multi-channel/ebay/ebay-setup#11000, Importing eBay listings>> chapter.

== Example of use: Creating items and editing item data

Use the *Data* menu to create items or to edit existing item data. This function is useful if you want to import item lists from your supplier into plentymarkets or adjust your item prices. First, create the data format *Item* in the *Data » Dynamic export* menu. Then export the data in a file and edit the data within the file. Afterwards, go to *Data » Dynamic import* and import the file.

== Example of use: Importing stock

You can also import the entire stock and thus overwrite the current physical stock in your plentymarkets system. To do so, use the data format <<basics/data-exchange/data-formats/stock#, Stock>>.

[WARNING]
.Stock is deleted
====
During this process, the current physical stock is replaced with the data that is imported. In other words, your entire stock is deleted. Reserved stock remains unaffected.

If you do not want to import your entire stock, but would rather add incoming stock via data import, use the special format *IncomingItems*.
====

If you plan on editing the import file before you import it, use the explanations on the data fields given below as a reference. <<table-data-fields-data-format-stock>> lists some of the data fields that are contained in the exported file.
