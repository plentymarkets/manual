The data format **EbayTitleMatch** gives you the possibility of linking a listing's title to specific items. With this link, listings that were set up with other tools can be imported into plentymarkets and can be automatically assigned to the correct items. You can carry out this setting directly in the editing window of an item. It is found in the tab **Multi-Channel » eBay title**. Create and export the data format in the **Data exchange » Export » Dynamic export** menu. Import the data format in the **Data exchange » Import » Dynamic import** menu. The **<<basics/data-exchange/exporting-data#, Exporting data>>** and **<<basics/data-exchange/importing-data#, Importing data>>** pages of the manual describe how you export and import the data format.
