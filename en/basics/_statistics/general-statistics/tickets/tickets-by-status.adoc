== Tickets by status

Displays the **tickets according to their status** during a specific time span. The ticket statuses are displayed for the **type of ticket** that was selected. Default setting for the time span: **The last 6 months**.

== Details about the statistic

The **number of tickets** will be displayed for the selected **time period**. The tickets are grouped according to **status**. The number of tickets and the corresponding **status** will be displayed as **information in a tooltip**. Furthermore, a second color displays the exact **time period** during which the corresponding tickets were received or edited (see image 1). If no tickets are available for a specific status, then this status will not be displayed. In this statistic, you can select a specific **type of ticket** and see how many of these tickets are in a particular status.

|Settings

|**Name**
|Shows the **name** of the statistic that was entered when the statistic was created. You can change the name here.

|**Time span**
|Each type of statistic has a default setting for **time span** that you can see in table 1 on the <<basics/statistics#, **Statistics**>> page of the manual. You can choose from a number of predefined time spans in a drop-down menu. In addition, for some types of statistics you have the possibility to enter a time span by entering a **start and end date**. +
**Change** the **time span** if no or only very few data is shown and then click on the save icon to see the result. Choosing a **larger time span** will give you more information. If there is a lot of data, then a **shorter time span** may make more sense in order to be able to actually interpret the graphic.

|You can enter a specific **starting and ending date** here instead of selecting a **time span** (optional).

|**Status**
|The **ticket types** that you created are displayed here. They are shown along with their corresponding **statuses** and can be selected for the statistic. All of the types and statuses are selected by default.

|**Customer ID**
|Enter a **customer ID** to see a statistic with the ticket data for this **specific customer**.

|**Customer class**
|Select the **customer class(es)** that you would like to include into the statistic.

|**Priority**
