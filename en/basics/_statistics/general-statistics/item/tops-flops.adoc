== Tops / Flops

This statistic shows the revenue data sorted according to __**tops**__ (those are the items that were sold most often during the selected __**time span**__) and __**flops**__ (those are the items that were sold least often during this time span). Default setting for the time span: **the current week**.

[WARNING]
.Time span for the analysis
====
If you choose the setting **Date selection** as the **Time span**, then please note that data will not be included in the analysis if it is more than __**6 months old**__. This is also true for the __**data export**__ (section 4).
====

== Details about the statistic

Depending on which option you select, either the __**Tops - most frequently sold items**__ or the __**Flops - least frequently sold items**__ will be displayed for the selected time span. The items will be listed in descending order. In other words, the list of tops will begin with the item that was sold the most often. This list will end with whichever top item was sold the least often. The list of flops is exactly the opposite. In other words, the list begins with whichever item was sold the least often and progresses with items that were sold more and more often. In this statistic you can see, e.g. which items are lucrative and which are not. For example, you may notice that the warehouse and operating costs of an item are higher than the profit.

[IMPORTANT]
.Data for item bundles
====
This statistic takes sold quantities into consideration when calculating basic items from item bundles. However, it does not take the purchase price and revenue into consideration.
====

In image 1, you can see __**tops**__ listed in descending order.

|**Data table** = An overview of the data in table format

|**Export**
|The data for this diagram is exported in a __**CSV file**__. The parameters are used as displayed. They are the same parameters as shown in the **Data table** diagram.

|**Raw data export**
|This also generates a __**CSV file**__. However, more detailed data is exported. For example, instead of simply indicating the number of orders that were generated on a specific day, the CSV file includes relevant data fields for each individual order, such as the **order ID**, **price** etc.
