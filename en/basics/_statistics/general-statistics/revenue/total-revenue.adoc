==  1) Info: total revenue development

This statistic shows the **number of sales orders** and the **revenue in Euro** for a certain **time span** that was previously set. Default setting for the time span: revenue of the **last 10 days**.

==  2) Details about the statistic

The **number of sales orders** and the **revenue in Euro** will be displayed for each day within the selected **time span**. If no sales orders are available, then the point **0** will be displayed on the line graph and no column will be displayed behind it. The **number of sales orders** and the corresponding **date** will be displayed as information in a mouseover. Furthermore, a second color will display the **revenue** that was generated by the particular number of sales orders (see image 1). In this statistic you can see, e.g. when a few sales orders generated a large amount of revenue and therefore many sales orders generated only a small amount of revenue.

[WARNING]
.**Item bundles**
====
The **number of returned items from item bundles** will be analyzed. However, the corresponding [.underline]#revenue will not#.

Explanations of the options

[cols="a,a"]
|====
| Entry/Setting | Explanation

|
| Diagram view

|**Type of diagram**
| In this drop-down menu, you can choose how you want the statistics to be displayed. +
**Column line combination chart** = Displays the values as lines and columns +
**Data table** = An overview of the data in table format

|
|**Net** = Amounts minus VAT. +
**Adjusted revenue** = Revenue minus credit notes +
**Contribution margin I** = Revenue minus the purchase price, taxes and shipping costs

|**Export**
| The data for this diagram is exported in a **CSV file**. The file contains the same parameters as are displayed with the **Data table** diagram.

|**Raw data export**
| The raw data export also generates a **CSV file**. However, the file contains a more detailed set of data. For example, instead of simply indicating the number of sales orders that were generated on a specific day, the CSV file includes relevant data fields for each individual sales order, such as the **sales order ID**, **price** etc.

|**Displaying the values**
| Click on the diagram legend in the lower left corner to make a specific set of values **visible** or **invisible** in the diagram. This allows you to display data separately, i.e. to look at some aspects of the data and hide others. This can help you recognize individual values more easily if your data set is very complicated.

|
| Settings

|**Name**
| Shows the **name** of the statistic that was entered when the statistic was created. You can change the name here.

|**Time span**
| Each type of statistic has a default setting for **time span** that you can see in table 1 on the <<basics/statistics#, Statistics>> page of the manual. You can choose from a number of predefined time spans in a drop-down menu. In addition for some types of statistics you have the possibility to enter a time span by entering a **start and end date**.

|
|**Change** the **time span** if no or only very few data is shown and then click on the save icon to see the result. Choosing a **larger time span** will give you more information. If there is a lot of data, then a **shorter time span** may make more sense in order to be able to actually interpret the graphic.

|**Starting date ... Ending date**
| You can enter a specific **starting and ending date** here instead of selecting a **time span** (optional).

|**Status options**
| Depending on the type of statistic there are different options available to narrow down the **status**. There are **standard values** set by default.

|
|**All types of sales orders** are included in the statistical analysis except for **cancellations**. This means that **status 8** and **8.1** are excluded from the statistic.

|**Multishop**
| Select the **webshops** or **multishops** that you would like to include into the statistic.

|**Sales order referrer**
| Here you can select one or more **sales order referrers**. You can also use the option **All** to select all of the available sales order referrers at once.

|
| The **sales order referrers** correspond to individual **sales orders** and not to sales order items.

|**Payment method**
| Select which **payment method** should be included in the statistic or use the option **All** to include all of the payment methods.

|**Shipping profile**
| Select which **shipping profile** should be included in the statistic or use the option **All** to include all of the shipping profiles.

|**Net**
| Activate this option to display **net amounts** in the statistic.

|**Paid sales orders only**
| Select this option if you only want to include **paid sales orders** in the statistic.

|**Sales orders with outgoing items booked only**
| Select this option if you only want to include **sales orders with outgoing items booked** in the statistic.
