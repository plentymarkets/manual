== 1) Info: revenue by referrer per order

This statistic shows how much **revenue** was generated by each sales order **referrer**. Furthermore, it shows which **percentage** of the total revenue each referrer generated. As an alternative to selecting a certain predefined time span, you can also choose an individual **start** and **end date**. Default setting for the **time span**: the **last 30 days**. Default setting of the **status section**: from **status 1** to **status 7**.

== 2) Details about the statistic

The **revenue in Euro** will be displayed for each **sales order referrer** within the selected **time span**. If a sales order referrer did not generate any revenue, then this referrer will not be displayed. The **sales order referrer**, the corresponding **revenue in Euro** and the **percentage of total revenue** will be displayed as **information in a mouseover** (see image 1). In this statistic you can see, e.g. which referrers generated a large amount of revenue. Conversely, you can also see which referrers generated little or no revenue.

|Entry/Setting |Explanation

|Diagram view

|**Type of diagram**
|In this drop-down menu, you can choose how you want the statistics to be displayed. +
**2D pie chart** = Displays the values as a two-dimensional pie chart +
**3D pie chart** = Displays the values as a three-dimensional pie chart +
**Data table** = An overview of the data in table format

|**Export**
|The data for this diagram is exported in a **CSV file**. The file contains the same parameters as are displayed with the **Data table** diagram.

|**Raw data export**
|The raw data export also generates a **CSV file**. However, the file contains a more detailed set of data. For example, instead of simply indicating the number of sales orders that were generated on a specific day, the CSV file includes relevant data fields for each individual sales order, such as the **sales order ID**, **price** etc.

|Each type of statistic has a default setting for **time span** that you can see in table 1 on the <<basics/statistics#, Statistics>> page of the manual. You can choose from a number of predefined time spans in a drop-down menu. In addition for some types of statistics you have the possibility to enter a time span by entering a **start and end date**.

If there is a lot of data, then a **shorter time span** may make more sense in order to be able to actually interpret the graphic.
