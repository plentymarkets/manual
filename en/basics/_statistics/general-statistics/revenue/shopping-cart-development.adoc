== 1) Info: shopping cart development

This statistic shows the average **shopping cart value** as well as the average **shipping costs** during a certain **time span**. Default setting for the time span: shopping cart values of the **last 30 days**.

== 2) Details about the statistic

The **shopping cart value** and the **shipping costs** will be displayed for the selected **time span**. If no shopping cart value is available, then no column will be displayed. The **shopping cart value** and the corresponding **date** will be displayed as **information in a mouseover**. Furthermore, a second color will display the **shipping costs** that were generated by the particular shopping cart value (see image 1). In this statistic you can see, e.g. whether the average shopping cart value was higher or lower in one month than another. For example, it may be interesting to see how the shopping cart value changed during the Christmas shopping season or during a big sale.

Explanations of the options

|Entry/Setting |Explanation

|
|Diagram view

|**Type of diagram**
|In this drop-down menu, you can choose how you want the statistics to be displayed. +
**Stacked column chart** = Displays the values as columns. The shopping cart values (blue) are on the bottom and the shipping costs (red) are stacked on top. +
**Data table** = An overview of the data in table format

|**Export**
|The data for this diagram is exported in a **CSV file**. The file contains the same parameters as are displayed with the **Data table** diagram.

|**Raw data export**
|The raw data export also generates a **CSV file**. However, the file contains a more detailed set of data. For example, instead of simply indicating the number of sales orders that were generated on a specific day, the CSV file includes relevant data fields for each individual sales order, such as the **sales order ID**, **price** etc.

|
|Settings

|**Name**
|Shows the **name** of the statistic that was entered when the statistic was created. You can change the name here.

|**Time span**
|Each type of statistic has a default setting for **time span** that you can see in table 1 on the <<basics/statistics#, **Statistics**>> page of the manual. You can choose from a number of predefined time spans in a drop-down menu. In addition for some types of statistics you have the possibility to enter a time span by entering a **start and end date**.

|
|**Change** the **time span** if no or only very few data is shown and then click on the save icon to see the result. Choosing a **larger time span** will give you more information. If there is a lot of data, then a **shorter time span** may make more sense in order to be able to actually interpret the graphic.

|**Starting date ... Ending date**
|You can enter a specific **starting and ending date** here instead of selecting a **time span** (optional).

|**Multishop**
|Select the **webshops** or **multishops** that you would like to include into the statistic.

|**Sales order referrer**
|Here you can select one or more **sales order referrers**. You can also use the option **All** to select all of the available sales order referrers at once.

|**Payment method**
|**Select** which **payment method** should be included in the statistic or use the option **All** to include all of the payment methods.

|**Shipping profile**
|**Select** which **shipping profile** should be included in the statistic or use the option **All** to include all of the shipping profiles.

|**Sales order responsible**
|Here you can select one or more **users who are responsible for the sales orders**. You can also use the option **All** to select all of the available users at once.

|**Net**
