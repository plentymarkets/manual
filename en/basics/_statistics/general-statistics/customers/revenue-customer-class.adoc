==  1) Info: revenue by customer class

This statistic shows the **revenues** and corresponding sales orders according to the **customer classes** depending on the **time span** as well as the **sales order status**. As an alternative to selecting a certain predefined time span, you can also choose an individual **start** and **end date**. Default setting for the **time span**: the **last 30 days**. Default setting of the **status section**: from **status 1** to **status 7**.

==  2) Details about the statistic

Revenue by customer class

The name of the **customer class**, the **quantity of sales orders** and the corresponding **revenue in Euro** will be displayed for the selected **time span**. If a customer class did not generate any revenue, then this customer class will not be displayed. The name of the **customer class**, the **quantity of sales orders** for the customer class and the corresponding **revenue in Euro** will be displayed as information in a mouseover (see image 1). In this statistic you can see, e.g. which customer classes generated the most revenue and are therefore particularly lucrative for your company.

**Show details (mouseover)**

Point your **cursor** at one of the elements in the statistic in order to see **details** about that particular element.

Revenue by evaluation

The **revenue in Euro** and the corresponding **quantity of sales orders** will be displayed for the **customer evaluations** that were given by the seller during the selected **time span**. If the seller did not give a specific evaluation, then this evaluation will not be displayed. In other words, if no customers were evaluated with 2 stars, but many customers were evaluated with 1 and 3 stars, then the 2 will not be displayed. The **quantity of sales orders** for this evaluation and the corresponding **revenue in Euro** will be displayed as **information in a mouseover** (see image 1). In this statistic you can see, e.g. whether or not customers that were given a higher evaluation generated more revenue than other customers.

Explanations of the options

| Entry/Setting | Explanation

|
| Diagram view

|**Type of diagram**
| In this drop-down menu, you can choose how you want the statistics to be displayed. +
**Column line combination chart** = Displays the revenue as columns and the sales orders as lines +
**Data table** = An overview of the data in table format

|**Export**
| The data for this diagram is exported in a **CSV file**. The file contains the same parameters as are displayed with the **Data table** diagram.

|**Raw data export**
| The raw data export also generates a **CSV file**. However, the file contains a more detailed set of data. For example, instead of simply indicating the number of sales orders that were generated on a specific day, the CSV file includes relevant data fields for each individual sales order, such as the **sales order ID**, **price** etc.

| Settings

|**Name**
| Shows the **name** of the statistic that was entered when the statistic was created. You can change the name here.

|**Time span**
| Each type of statistic has a default setting for **time span** that you can see in table 1 on the <<basics/statistics#, Statistics>> page of the manual. You can choose from a number of predefined time spans in a drop-down menu. In addition for some types of statistics you have the possibility to enter a time span by entering a **start and end date**.

|
|**Change** the **time span** if no or only very few data is shown and then click on the save icon to see the result. Choosing a **larger time span** will give you more information. If there is a lot of data, then a **shorter time span** may make more sense in order to be able to actually interpret the graphic.

| Depending on the type of statistic there are different options available to narrow down the **status**. There are **standard values** set by default.

|**Multishop**
| Select the **webshops** or **multishops** that you would like to include into the statistic.

| Here you can select one or more **sales order referrers**. You can also use the option **All** to select all of the available sales order referrers at once.

|**Payment method**
|**Select** which **payment method** should be included in the statistic or use the option **All** to include all of the payment methods.

|**Shipping profile**
|**Select** which **shipping profile** should be included in the statistic or use the option **All** to include all of the shipping profiles.
