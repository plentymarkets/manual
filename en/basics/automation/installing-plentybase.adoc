== Making plentyBase available on a network

You can install plentyBase on one computer of a network and make it available for the network's other computers. To use plentyBase within a network, the IP address and the host name of the computer on which plentyBase is installed need to be saved in the HOSTS files of the other computers in the network.

You need admin rights to edit the HOSTS file of the client computer.

[WARNING]
