==  Procedure manager

In plentymarkets, recurring events can be taken care of automatically by the **procedure manager** and carried out at specific times.

For example, you can use the procedure manager to set up a daily time when customers who have not paid for their purchases on eBay or your online store should receive a payment reminder or a dunning letter that is automatically sent via email. For further information about these examples and possible configurations, refer to the <<basics/automation/automating-processes#, Automating processes>> best practice page of the manual.

==  Configuring a new procedure

The **Settings**, **Filter** and **Procedure** tabs contain different settings that are used to configure a procedure. Proceed as follows to configure the individual tabs.

===  Tab: Settings

Use this tab to name the procedure, set the time when the procedure should be carried out and to activate the daily process.

|**The order includes an entire line of items**
| Select **Yes** and then select an attribute from the drop-down list below. The filter checks the stock of items that the selected attribute corresponds to. If one of the items has no stock, then the filter will not go into effect for this order.

|**Incoming payment**
|Select one of the following options: +
**OPEN** = Only considers orders that have not been paid yet or for which no payment has been booked yet. +
**BOOKED** = Only considers orders that have been completely paid, partially paid or overpaid. +
**COMPLETELY BOOKED** = Only considers orders that have been completely paid or overpaid.
