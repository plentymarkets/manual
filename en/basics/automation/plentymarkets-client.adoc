== plentymarkets Client

The **plentymarkets Client** allows you to link plentymarkets to locally installed devices. You can, e.g. connect <<basics/working-with-plentymarkets/printer#, **printers**  >> directly to your system. As such, one piece of software gives you access to all of the functions instead of having to switch between different programs. You can also use the Client to configure <<basics/automation/processes#, **processes**  >>. This allows you to automate detailed procedures within your company.
