:position: 30

This chapter deals with the work steps that can be configured for processes. You can create and configure as many work steps as desired for a process. The possibilities for configuration will be more or less detailed depending on which type of work step is selected. These are primarily made up of procedures and sub-procedures that are carried out one after the other and can either run endlessly or be controlled manually. You can set up conditions that act as filters and make it possible to set up very individual configurations for the work steps.

[IMPORTANT]

[NOTE]
.Example configuration
====
The example in image 1 shows that 30 orders are set as the limit. Orders will be filtered that have a specific flag and date (received yesterday). While being processed, the orders will receive a new status and a new owner.
====

The submenus shown in image 1 are explained below.

==== Settings

Here, general settings for the work step need to be carried out, e.g. a name and its position in the process.

The following table explains the settings of the work step:

|Setting |Explanation

|**Name**
|Select a name that identifies the work step as clearly as possible.

|**Number**
|Enter how many orders should be processed per run.

|**Next step**
|Select whether an additional work step should be started manually or automatically. This setting is only relevant if at least two work steps are configured. +
**Awaiting input** = The next step or procedure will not be started automatically. Rather, the process will be paused until you click on **Start** in the menu for carrying out the process. +
**Start automatically** = The next step or procedure will be started automatically.

|**Change position**
|If multiple work steps were configured, then the order can be changed here.

==== Filter

Use **filters** to select orders according to the criteria available in the filter.

The following table explains the filters available for this work step:

.Overview of filters; explanations of the configurations
[cols="a,a"]
|====
|Filter |Explanation

|**Number of order items**
|Select an **operator** from the drop-down menu and enter a number into the field. This will search for orders that include a certain number of items.

|**Order warehouse**
|Select a warehouse from the drop-down menu to only search for orders that contain items from this warehouse.

|**Order type**
|Select a specific order type if you only want to process this type of order. The list also includes some combinations of order types.

|**Date**
|Select a point in time, e.g. **Yesterday** or e.g. **in the past**, in order to filter all existing orders. You can select more than one option.

|**Owner**
|Select the user whose orders you want to filter. +
**Active user** = User who is currently logged into the system.

|**Email address**
|Select an option to only filter for those orders that **include** an email address in the customer data record or that **do not include** an email address in the customer data record.

|**Express shipping**
|Select whether you want to filter orders with express shipping or not. +
**Yes** = Only orders with express shipping +
**No** = Only orders without express shipping

|**Total quantity of items**
|Select an **operator** from the drop-down menu and enter a number into the field. This will search for orders that include a certain number of unique items.

|**Weight**
|Orders can be filtered by weight in grams. Enter a value and select the **equals sign** to filter orders with an exact weight. Enter a value and select the appropriate operator to filter orders within a certain weight range. You can filter two different weight ranges by using both text fields at once. +
**Example:** For a weight of 3.5 kg and higher, enter **3500** into the text field and select the operator **&gt;=**.

|**Referrer**
|Select the order referrer of those orders that you want to filter. You can select more than one option.

|**Customer class**
|Select one or more customer classes.

|**Country of delivery**
|Select the country of delivery of those orders that you want to filter. All countries of delivery can be selected here. Not only those that you activated in your system.

|**Client (store)**
|Select the client (store) of those orders that you want to filter. You can select more than one option.

|**Flag**
|Select the flag of those orders that you want to filter. The option **None** will filter orders that do not have a flag.

|**Pending pick list**
|Pending <<order-processing/orders/order-documents/pick-list#, pick lists>> are those that have not been completely processed yet. In order for the filter to be effective, a pending pick list has to be available in general. If this is not the case, then orders will not be filtered by the specified conditions. Instead, orders will be loaded by other filters set up here only. Options: +
**Use** = Continue processing a pending pick list. +
**Do not use** = Start a new pick list. +
If the filter with the setting **Use** is looking for the corresponding orders and finds a pending pick list, the orders of this pick list will be loaded. All other filters set up for this work step will be ignored then. You have to set up a box storage rack in the <<basics/automation/processes/procedures#140, item registration procedure>> as a condition for the following processing of the loaded pick list. +
If you deactivate the filter by selecting **Do not use**, then a new pick list will automatically be created assuming that the previously mentioned condition is fulfilled. However, if there is a pending pick list available when selecting this option, then the process will be canceled and an error message will be displayed. In this case, the pending pick list has to be processed in advance.

|**Packstation**

|**Shipping profiles**
|Select one or more shipping profiles to only filter orders with this shipping profile.

|**Shipping region**
|Select a shipping region to only filter orders from this region.

|**Outgoing items**
|Select how you want to filter by outgoing items: +
**Not booked** = only orders without outgoing items booked +
**Booked** = only orders with outgoing items booked +
**Today** = only orders with outgoing items booked today +
**Yesterday** = only orders with outgoing items booked yesterday

|**Payment**
|Select the payment status by which you want to filter the orders: **Check payment**, **Unpaid only**, **Paid only**, **Partial payment only**, **Initial payment is complete**, **Overpaid only** or **Unpaid and partially paid**. +
