:description: Overview of the procedures and control elements that can be configured in plentymarkets.
:position: 40

This page of the manual contains information about the control elements and procedures you can add to work steps of processes in the **System Â» Processes** menu.

The control elements and procedures are listed in separate chapters and in alphabetical order. The information is presented based on the following pattern:

* Short explanation of the control element/procedure
* The work steps in which the control element/procedure can be used
* Any settings that are specific to this control element/procedure
* For procedures: Procedures available in case of error
* For procedures: Sub-procedures available for the procedure

The information presented on this page serves as reference for users familiar with the basic concept of plentymarkets procedures. For basic information on processes, refer to the <<basics/automation/processes/setting-up-processes#, Setting up processes>> page of the manual.


[IMPORTANT]
.Tool plentyBase required
====
To create and run processes, you need plentyBase. You can download the installation files in the link:https://marketplace.plentymarkets.com/plugins/externe-tools/plentyBase_5053/[plentyMarketplace^].

== Control elements

This chapter deals with the control elements that can be configured for processes. Control elements are used to control how the procedures of a work step interact with each other.

[#480]
=== General settings for control elements

Some settings are available for all control elements. The following table explains these settings. The settings **Show** and **Destination** are not available for all control elements. However, they are also described here. You can check whether or not the settings are available for a given control element by reading the explanations provided for the control element in question.

.Information on the general settings for control elements
[cols="a,a"]
|====
|Setting |Explanation

|**Position**
|Option is only visible after the control element is created. +
The procedure's current position in the work step. The procedure with the lowest position number is run first. Select a different position from the drop-down list to change the order in which the procedures are run in the work step. +
**__Tip:__** Procedures can also be moved using the context menu. To do so, right-click the procedure and select **Move up** or **Move down**.

|**Show**
|Select if the procedure should be displayed in the work step. +
**Yes** (default setting) = Procedure is shown in the **Processes** menu. +
**No** = Procedure is not shown in the **Processes** menu. The procedure runs in the background.

|**Destination**
|Select the procedure to jump to. You can You can select from the procedures available for the work step to which you are adding the control element. +
**__Tip:__** The procedure's ID is shown above the icon in the process overview. This helps you to distinguish different procedures of the same name. If you point your cursor to the procedure, the ID is displayed in the upper left corner.
|====

[#490]
=== Dialog

Use the control element **Dialog** to jump to a specific procedure. Use this query to jump to a specific point of the process. Similar to the control element Split, you can then continue with one of several options. There are several different ways to configure the control element. Add a title and leave a message for the user. The different options that the user can select are configured as Buttons.
For example, you can use the Dialog procedure to ask the user which shipping service should be used for the orders in the process. Available services will then be displayed as buttons. The user can select a service by clicking on it.

[.subhead]
Work steps

This control element can be selected for the following work steps:

* <<basics/automation/processes/work-steps#order-processing, Order processing>>
* <<basics/automation/processes/work-steps#single-sales-order-processing, Single order processing>>
* <<basics/automation/processes/work-steps#incoming-items, Incoming items>>

[.subhead]
Settings

The following table explains the additional settings of the control element: The general settings for control elements are described in <<basics/automation/processes/procedures#480, table 1>>. Because input from the user is required, the setting **Destination** is not available for this control element.

.Settings for the control element **Dialog**
[cols="a,a"]
|====
|Setting |Explanation

2+|Setting

|**Title**
|Enter a name for the question.

|**Message**
|Enter a text, e.g. a question such as "How do you want to continue?".

2+|Button

|**Add**
|Click on the **green plus icon** to add a button. You can add up to 5 buttons per dialogue.

|**Name**
|Enter a name for the button, e.g. the name of the target procedure.

|**Position**
|Determine the button's position in the dialog. +
**__Tip:__** Put the buttons in the same order as their destinations appear in the process for better usability.

|**Colour**
|Select the colour of the button from the drop-down list.
|====

[#500]
=== End

The control element **End** finishes a work step or a process. For example, the control element **End** is required to end a loop.

[.subhead]
Work steps

This procedure can be selected for the following work steps:

* <<basics/automation/processes/work-steps#order-processing, Order processing>>
* <<basics/automation/processes/work-steps#single-sales-order-processing, Single order processing>>
* <<basics/automation/processes/work-steps#incoming-items, Incoming items>>

[.subhead]
Settings

No additional settings are required for this control element. The general settings for control elements are described in <<basics/automation/processes/procedures#480, table 1>>. Because the control element ends the work step, the setting **Destination** is not available.

[#510]
=== Filter

The control element **Filter** opens a filter within a process. You can use it to filter specific orders and carry out a procedure for these orders. The procedure will not be carried out for those orders that do not match the filter. Once the steps have been completed, use the procedure **Reset filter** to end the filter.

[.subhead]
Work steps

This procedure can be selected for the following work steps:

* <<basics/automation/processes/work-steps#order-processing, Order processing>>
* <<basics/automation/processes/work-steps#single-sales-order-processing, Single order processing>>

[.subhead]
Settings

.Settings for the control element **Filter**
[cols="a,a"]
|====
|Setting |Explanation

|**Filter**

|====

[#530]
=== Jump

[.subhead]
Work steps

This procedure can be selected for the following work steps:

* <<basics/automation/processes/work-steps#order-processing, Order processing>>

* <<basics/automation/processes/work-steps#order-processing, Order processing>>
* <<basics/automation/processes/work-steps#single-sales-order-processing, Single order processing>>

[.subhead]
Settings

No additional settings are required for this control element. The general settings for control elements are described in <<basics/automation/processes/procedures#480, table 1>>.

[#550]
=== Split

A **Split** divides the process. Here you can select an option, i.e. you can save a condition for a destination. The process will continue if the element's condition, e.g. the status of an order, is not met. If the condition is met, then the order will jump to the destination that was selected.

[.subhead]
Work steps

This procedure can be selected for the following work steps:
