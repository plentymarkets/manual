:description: Learn how to use plentymarkets.
:position: 20

This quick start helps you set up your online store and publish it on the Internet. All of the topics are described in further detail in other chapters of the manual. Simply click on the links to access more detailed information.

The quick start is divided into the chapters <<basics/first-steps/quick-start#10, Initial settings>>, <<basics/first-steps/quick-start#270, Setting up the online store>> and <<basics/first-steps/quick-start#690, Setting up automatic processes>>. Each chapter covers one aspect of setting up of your online store. Work through these chapters in the given order, as each chapter builds on the previous ones. The quick start aims to help you set up a functional online store as quickly as possible. As such, it only describes the most necessary functions.

First, a preparatory subchapter lists any requirements or tasks that need to be completed before you begin. Second, additional subchapters describe how to set up the system. Each step of the process is explained in detail and is clearly laid out. A checklist gives you the chance to make sure that all of the necessary steps were carried out.

The <<basics/first-steps/quick-start#820, Final check>> is an instrument to recheck everything before your plentymarkets system goes live. Check the settings very carefully so that potential customers do not become involuntary beta testers of your system, but rather bring in your first revenue. In addition, familiarise yourself with the basic legal conditions of electronic commerce and comply with these regulations. Otherwise, you might receive expensive warnings from your competitors.

[#10]
== Initial settings

This chapter provides information about the basic settings that need to be carried out in the **Settings** menu to set up a functional online store. You will learn how to create and manage user accounts, how to configure email settings and how to set up shipping and payment methods.

[#20]
=== Preparation

Here you will find information about the most important requirements and preliminary tasks for configuring the initial settings. You will also learn which data is needed for the quick start.

[#30]
==== Install an appropriate browser

Install Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox or Safari (Mac OS).

[TIP]
.Browser compatibility
====
plentymarkets functions best with the link:https://www.google.co.uk/intl/en/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome^] browser. However, you can also access plentymarkets with link:https://www.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/products/[Mozilla Firefox^] or link:http://www.apple.com/uk/safari/[Safari (Mac OS)^]. This limitation only applies to the admin area. Your online store can be accessed with all of the typical Internet browsers.
====

[#40]
==== Have your email account data ready

You have to save your email access data in the system before plentymarkets can send emails from your email account. Therefore, have the account details at hand for the email address that should be used to send notifications to customers (e.g. info@mystore.com). Use the same settings as in your email program (e.g. Outlook or Thunderbird).

[#50]
==== Have your tracking URL ready

Have the tracking URL of your shipping service provider at hand. Customers can use this link to track their orders online. The shipping service provider's tracking URL has to be entered in the system in order for this to be possible. Ask the shipping service provider for the tracking URL. The website links of integrated shipping service providers can be found on the <<order-processing/fulfilment/preparing-the-shipment#2500, Preparing the shipment>> page of the manual.

[#60]
==== Have your access data ready and log in for the first time

Have your plentymarkets access data at hand. You received this data via email. This is the URL of the test system, your user name and password. Use this data to log into the admin area of your plentymarkets system for the first time.

[.instruction]
First login:

. Start your browser.
. Find the URL that you received via email and enter this URL into the browser's address line.
. Use the access data to log into the admin area of your plentymarkets test system. +
→ The plentymarkets back end will open.
. Save a bookmark for your plentymarkets system.

[#65]
==== Allowing pop-ups

In several areas of the back end, pop-ups are used to, e.g., offer documents for download. To ensure proper functionality, add your plentymarkets back end to your browser's pop-up whitelist. To do so, proceed as follows.

. Open your browser.
. Open the settings.
. Go to the pop-up exception management.
. Enter the link *https://[&#42;.]plentymarkets-cloud-de.com:PID* for aws01 and *https://[&#42;.]plentymarkets-cloud-ie.com:PID* for aws02 in the exception list. Please replace *PID* with your plenty ID. +
→ The exception for your back end is added.

[#70]
=== Lock store

Before you begin making changes to your online store, you should <<omni-channel/online-store/setting-up-clients/online-store#lock-store, lock>> it and redirect your visitors to a page with a service note while your store is under construction. Unlock your store again when you have finished making changes. Otherwise, you will not be able to receive orders. We recommend that you open the online store using the standard URL in another browser after each maintenance. Use this chance to check whether all your changes have been carried out correctly.

[.instruction]
Locking the online store:

. Go to **System » Client » Select client » Online store » Lock store**.
. Click on **Lock store now** to redirect customers to a page with a service note.

[#80]
=== Managing user accounts

The admin area of your plentymarkets system is password protected and can only be accessed by registered users. Therefore, we will start by looking at how to create and manage user accounts. Go to <<basics/working-with-plentymarkets/manage-users#, System » Settings » User>> to create and manage users. Every user is given an individual user account and is assigned to a user class. The user classes are preset and include specific rights. <<basics/working-with-plentymarkets/manage-users#70, Roles>> allow you to assign users to individual groups. Roles can also be used to assign rights to an entire group of users. First, we will describe how to create and manage users.

[#90]
==== Creating a new user

A standard user with administrator rights is already available in your test system. User class: Admin. We recommend that you change this user account immediately and create your own password.

The administration area contains sensitive data and has to be efficiently protected from unauthorised access and hackers. Therefore, handle user accounts with great care and only use passwords with at least 8 characters.

[IMPORTANT]
.Caution: Pay attention to the password strength!
====
If you try to save a weak password, then you will receive the **error message****Code 900: The password entered is too weak!** The password should always contain a mixture of lower-case letters, upper-case letters and numbers. Pay attention to the colour-coded bar and percentage in the system. If possible, use a password that has a "green" rating.
====

[.instruction]
Creating a new user:

. Go to **System » Settings » User » Accounts**.
. Click on **New**. +
→ The <<basics/working-with-plentymarkets/manage-users#10, Create new user>> window will open (<<image-create-new-user>>).
. Enter the **User name**, **Actual name** and **Password**.
. Repeat the password.
. Enter the new user's email address. This will allow the user to receive messages from the system.
. Select a **User class** (see the configuration note below).
. **Save** the settings.

[[image-create-new-user]]
.creating a new user
image::basics/first-steps/assets/EN-Quick-Start-01.png[]


[NOTE]
.Classes and their rights
====
A <<basics/working-with-plentymarkets/manage-users#10, user class>> contains specific user rights. For example, the class **Admin** contains all of the rights without limitation. At least one user must be an admin. This is because only admins are authorised to manage and edit other user accounts without restriction. Use the class **Variable** to set up individual rights for a user. This allows you to give variable users the exact read and write permissions that they need. The classes **Callcenter**, **API**, **Logistics** and **Blog** have limited rights.
====

[#100]
==== Editing a user

Proceed as follows to edit a user.

[.instruction]
Editing a user account:

. Go to **System » Settings » User » Accounts**.
. Click on **Open user**. +
→ The user will open in a new tab (<<image-editing-user>>).
. Carry out additional settings as desired. For further information, refer to the explanations on the <<basics/working-with-plentymarkets/manage-users#20, Editing users>> page of the manual.
. **Save** the settings.

[[image-editing-user]]
.editing a user
image::basics/first-steps/assets/EN-Quick-Start-02.png[]


[TIP]
.Password is saved
====
The password that you entered when creating your user account will not be visible in the editing mode later on but it is saved. You do not have to reenter the password when editing the user account.
====

[#105]
==== Setting a user as owner

In the **Owner** tab, determine the areas the user should be owner of.

[.instruction]
Setting a user as owner:

. Go to **System » Settings » User » Accounts**.
. Click on **Open user**. +
→ The user will open in a new tab.
. Click on the **Owner** tab.
. Activate the areas the user should own.  +
→ To use the plentymarkets stock management system, place a check mark next to **incoming items**.
. **Save** the settings.

[#110]
==== Deleting a user

There are two ways to delete a user:

[.instruction]
Deleting a user account:

. Go to **System » Settings » User » Accounts**.
. Open the user that you want to delete (<<image-editing-user>>).
. Click on **Delete user account** on the right side of the header.
. **Confirm** your decision to delete the user.

[.instruction]
Deleting several user accounts:

. Go to **System » Settings » User » Accounts**.
. Place a check mark next to the user accounts.
. Click on **Group function**.
. Activate the **Delete** function.
. Click on **Apply**.
. **Confirm** your decision to delete the users.

[#120]
=== Configuring email settings

Not only can your plentymarkets system send notifications to administrators, it can also send automatic <<crm/sending-emails#, emails>> to your customers. The system automatically generates order and shipping confirmations, dunning letters and other notifications and sends them to customers.

[#130]
==== Entering email access data

You have to enter your <<crm/sending-emails#100, access data>> into the system before plentymarkets can send emails on your behalf from your email account. Use the same settings as in your email program (e.g. Outlook or Thunderbird).

[.instruction]
Entering email access data:

. Go to **System » Client » Select client » Email » Access data**.
. Pay attention to the explanations given in <<table-entering-email-access-data>> and carry out the settings as desired.
. **Save** the settings.

|====

[#140]
==== Setting up the email information service

Use the <<crm/sending-emails#700, Information service>> to have more control over the emails that are sent by the system. This function can send all outgoing emails as blind copies (BCC) to an email address of your choice. It can also send an email notification every time a new order is placed in your online store. You need to know which email address the information service should send emails to.

[.instruction]

. Enter the email address.
. Select **YES** to activate the information service for the address.
. **Save** the settings.

Select **NO** to deactivate the information service.

[#150]
==== Setting up email templates

plentymarkets creates all emails based on <<crm/sending-emails#1200, Templates>>. This section teaches you how to create email templates or edit existing templates as needed. The section <<basics/first-steps/quick-start#690, Setting up automatic processes>> teaches you how to have emails sent whenever specific events occur and how to automatically send emails at specific times of day.

The following table includes a list of email templates that we recommend creating when you start working with plentymarkets.

.Recommended email templates for the quick start
[cols="a,a"]
|====
|Email template |Explanation

|**Order: Invoice as PDF attachment**
|Sends an invoice to the customer as an attachment.

|**Order: Partial payment received**
|Informs the customer if a partial payment is received (is described further below).

|**Order: Shipping confirmation**

|**Online store: Sign up for newsletter**
|An important email template to use for legal reasons.
|====

You need to create documents for the emails and upload them in PDF format before you will be able to send these documents as attachments.

[WARNING]
.Do not forget the bank and contact details
====
Make sure that all of your email templates contain your bank details (it is also possible to use template variables) and that your current contact information is displayed at the end.
====

Your test system already contains several predefined <<crm/sending-emails#1200, email templates>>. The email template **Confirmation of a store order** is used as an example for how to customise email templates to meet your needs.

[.instruction]
Customising the email template "Confirmation of a store order":

. Go to **System » Client » Select client » Email » Templates**.
. Open the **General email templates** folder and click on **Online store: confirmation of store order**.
. Carry out the settings as desired. Pay attention to the information given in <<table-setup-email-templates>>.
. Add the cancellation rights.
. Add your contact details at the end of the template.
. **Save** the settings.

[IMPORTANT]
.Insert complete information about cancellation rights
====
Due to legal reasons, the template that you create for **confirming store orders** should also include **complete information about your cancellation rights**. Also pay close attention to any wording in the email template that relates to the contract between you and your customer. It is best to have your text checked by a legal adviser and then enter this exact wording into your email templates.
====

[[table-setup-email-templates]]
.Setting up email templates
[cols="a,a"]
|====
|Setting |Explanation

2+|Tab: Settings

|**Owner**
|Select an owner or the option **ALL**.

|**Name**
|Name of the email template used for internal reference only and not visible for the recipient.

|**Content**
|Select **Plain text only** or **Only text in HTML format**.

|**Template type**
|Select **All** (default setting), if you want the email template to be used for all areas. If you want to use the template in only one area, you can define this area here. The areas **Order**, **Customers**, **Online store**, **Ticket** and **Scheduler** can be selected.

|**PDF attachment**
|Select the attachment for the email template, e.g. the order confirmation or invoice.

|**Document attachment**
|Select the document attachment. Documents that were uploaded under **CMS » Documents** are displayed here. You can attach these documents to an email template.

2+|Tab: Email message

|**Select a language**
|Select the language for the template text and the subject.

|**Subject**
|Enter a sentence to be displayed to the recipient in the subject line of the email. Choose the subject carefully so that the emails will be recognised by the email account and displayed in the customer's inbox instead of his or her spam folder.
|====

[TIP]
.Setting up plain text emails
====
Start by creating plain text emails only. Enter your text under **Tab: Email message » Tab: Content**. HTML offers you more formatting options, but it also increases the risk that your emails will end up in your customers' spam folder. Therefore, we recommend that you use plain text only for important emails.
====

[.subhead]
Inserting template functions and template variables into email templates

In plentymarkets, <<crm/sending-emails#1200, email templates>> not only consist of text but also of <<crm/sending-emails#1300, template functions and template variables>>. When plentymarkets sends emails, it automatically replaces the variables with the corresponding content. The customer's name will appear instead of the variable **$Name[1]**. The customer's email address will appear instead of **$Email**. The order number will appear instead of the variable **$OrderID**.

[[image-template-variables-functions]]
.template variables and template functions window
image::basics/first-steps/assets/EN-Quick-Start-03.png[]


[IMPORTANT]
.Variable names are case-sensitive
====
Template variables and template functions trigger predefined system commands. They will only be recognised if you use the exact same spelling as shown in the system (upper and lower case letters must match as well). To avoid malfunctions caused by spelling mistakes, copy the variables and insert them at the desired position in the editing window.
====

[.instruction]
Inserting template variables and template functions:

. Open the **email template** and click on **Template variables and template functions** (<<image-template-variables-functions>>, red arrow).  +
→ The **Template variables and template functions** window will open.
. Copy the **variable** that you want to insert into the email template.
. Insert the variable into the text field in the **Email message » Content** tab of the email template.
. **Save** the settings.

The variable **Link_Checkout()** should be included in all of the emails that you send to customers. Customers can click on this URL to access the **My account** area of your store. In this area, customers can view and edit their personal information, view their order history, add notes or additional items to their order and also keep track of their order's status.

[.subhead]
Attaching files to email templates

You can attach two different types of files to your email templates: a PDF attachment and a document attachment.  +
PDF attachments, e.g. invoices are generated in the menu **System » Client » Select client » Locations » Select location » Documents**. Document attachments, e.g. other files such as item brochures or instructions are saved in the menu **CMS » Documents**.

[.subhead]
Creating and attaching PDFs

The system automatically generates the documents that are sent as PDF attachments. An example of such a document is the invoice.

It is set up in three steps. First, create a document template on your computer. For example, create a template for business letters with your logo. Save the template as a PDF file. Second, go to <<order-processing/orders/order-documents#, System » Orders » Documents>> and select the settings for the document. Third, select the PDF attachment for the email template.

[.instruction]
Editing the document:

. Go to **System » Client » Select client » Locations » Select location » Documents**.
. Open the document that you want to edit, e.g. the **invoice**.
. Select a **language** from the second drop-down menu, e.g. **en** for English.
. Carry out the settings in the **Template** tab.
. Click on the **PDF template » New template** tab.
. Select a **payment method** if needed.
. Click on **Browse**.
. Open the PDF document template that you previously created.
. **Save** the settings.
. Click on **Preview** to see a document preview.

[.instruction]
Attaching a PDF document to an email template:

. Go to **System » Client » Select client » Email » Templates**.
. Open the email template.
. Select the file that you want to use as an attachment from the **PDF attachment** drop-down menu.
. **Save** the settings. +
→ The file attached.

[.subhead]
Creating and attaching documents

All of the documents that you want to attach to an email have to be uploaded to the server first. The terms and conditions are an example of such a document. This document is often sent as an attachment along with the order confirmation.

It is set up in two steps. First, upload the document in the <<omni-channel/online-store/setting-up-clients/cms#documents, CMS » Documents>> menu. Second, attach the document to an email template. To do so, proceed as follows.

[.instruction]
Uploading a document:

. Go to **CMS » Documents**.
. Click on **Browse...** in the **Upload** tab.
. Select the **file** that you would like to upload and click on **Open**.
. Select one of the options from the **Right** drop-down menu.
. Enter a **folder name** (optional).
. **Save** the settings.

The **Right** option specifies whether the document should be visible to **Employees** or **Customers** only or to all visitors of your online store (= **Public**).

[.instruction]
Attaching a document to an email template:

. Go to **System » Client » Select client » Email » Templates**.
. Open the email template and select the file that you want to use as an attachment from the **Document attachment** drop-down menu.
. **Save** the settings. +
→ The file attached.

[#160]
=== Setting up shipping options

This section teaches you how to set up shipping options. First, decide which <<order-processing/fulfilment/preparing-the-shipment#100, countries>> you want to deliver your items to. Second, divide these countries into <<order-processing/fulfilment/preparing-the-shipment#400, regions>>. Such groups will help you create and manage shipping options more easily in the future. Third, create one or more <<order-processing/fulfilment/preparing-the-shipment#800, shipping service providers>> and afterwards <<order-processing/fulfilment/preparing-the-shipment#1000, shipping profiles>>. Fourth, create a <<order-processing/fulfilment/preparing-the-shipment#1500, table of shipping charges>> for each shipping profile.

There is a special concept for configuring shipping options in plentymarkets. You determine which shipping method and shipping costs are assigned to orders depending on the country of delivery and the <<omni-channel/order-referrer#, order referrer>>. For example, you can manage your eBay platform with several different eBay accounts and you can differentiate between specific types of listings. This allows you to set up a very elaborate shipping cost management system.

[#170]
==== Setting up countries of delivery

The overview lists all of the <<order-processing/fulfilment/preparing-the-shipment#100, countries of delivery>> included in ISO 3166-1.

[NOTE]
.At least one country of delivery required for shipping
====
You have to activate at least one country of delivery before you can define shipping costs.
====

[.instruction]
Setting up countries of delivery:

. Go to **System » Orders » Shipping » Settings**.
. The **Countries of delivery** tab opens. Use the drop-down menu in the **Active** column to set countries of delivery to **Active**.
. In the **Warehouse** column, select which warehouse should be chosen as the default warehouse for this country's orders.
. **Save** the settings.

[#180]
==== Setting up regions

Now set up regions and assign your countries of delivery to these <<order-processing/fulfilment/preparing-the-shipment#400, regions>>. It is necessary to create regions because shipping costs can only be saved for regions, rather than for individual countries. All countries that have the same shipping costs should be assigned to the same region.

[.instruction]
Grouping countries of delivery into regions:

. Go to **System » Orders » Shipping » Settings**.
. Open the **Regions » New region** tab.
. Select the countries for the region from the **Available countries**. +
→ The countries will be moved to the **Selected countries**.
. Enter a **Name** for the region, e.g. Europe.
. **Save** the settings. +
→ The new region is now available in the **Overview** tab.

Follow the same pattern to create other regions until all countries of delivery have been assigned to a region and the **Available countries** area is empty.

[#190]
==== Setting up shipping service providers

In this area, set up the <<order-processing/fulfilment/preparing-the-shipment#800, shipping service providers>> that you want to use for sending items to your customers.

[.instruction]
Setting up a shipping service provider:

. Go to **System » Orders » Shipping » Settings**.
. Click on the **Shipping service provider** tab.
. Click on **New**. +
→ A new line will be added at the bottom of the overview.
. Enter the **Name** of the shipping service provider into the line.
. Enter this shipping service provider's **Tracking URL**.
. **Save** the settings.

The tracking URL is used to track shipments. By entering the URL in your plentymarkets system, you will be able to include it in the shipping confirmation that you send to customers. This allows customers to track the items that are currently being delivered. Ask the shipping service provider for the tracking URL. The website links of integrated shipping service providers can be found on the <<order-processing/fulfilment/preparing-the-shipment#2500, Preparing the shipment>> page of the manual. The tracking URL needs to include the package number and may also need to include the recipient's postcode. This ensures that customers receive the tracking URL that matches their shipment. It would be quite time-consuming to manually enter this information for each shipment. Instead, insert the template variables **$PaketNr** and **$PLZ** into the tracking URL.

An example of a DHL tracking URL with such template variables: +
http://nolp.dhl.de/nextt-online-public/set_identcodes.do?lang=de&amp;zip=$PLZ&amp;idc=$PaketNr

[TIP]
.Changing the names of shipping service providers
====
You can create new providers or change the names of already existing providers. You can enter general names or the actual names of shipping service providers, such as DPD or DHL. The name that is entered will appear in the shopping cart and on the invoice.
====

[#200]
==== Setting up shipping profiles

<<order-processing/fulfilment/preparing-the-shipment#1000, Shipping profiles>> include detailed shipping costs and specify how these costs are calculated. For example, shipping costs can be based on the item weight, volume or the item prices. You can create several different shipping profiles for each shipping service provider. For example, you can set up a standard shipping profile and an express shipping profile for each provider. If multiple shipping profiles fit an order, then customers will be able to select which profile they would prefer in the online store.

Link the shipping profiles to your items so that plentymarkets knows how an item should be shipped and only allows customers to choose from the correct shipping profiles in the online store.

It is also possible to use multiple shipping profiles for mixed orders. The system will then add up the various shipping prices into a total and will show this price to the customer. If a customer not only wants to purchase items which you would usually ship with DHL, but also selects an item that can only be delivered by a shipping company for larger items, then the shipping prices that you saved for each shipping profile will be added up by the system and shown as a total.

[TIP]
.Keep the shipping profiles simple
====
Keep your shipping profiles as simple as possible. The more complex the settings are, the more likely it is that errors will occur. In addition, shipping cost models that are too complex may confuse customers and ultimately deter them from making a purchase.
====

[#210]
==== Creating tables of shipping charges

After you have created your shipping profiles, you can edit your shipping costs. To do so, create an individual table of shipping charges for each region. Before you enter data, you have to decide on one of the <<order-processing/fulfilment/preparing-the-shipment#1600, calculation types>> offered for each region.

[.instruction]
Creating tables of shipping charges:

. Go to **System » Orders » Shipping » Settings**.
. Click on the **Shipping profiles** tab.
. Open the shipping profile.
. Click on the **Table of shipping charges** tab within the shipping profile.
. Select a **Calculation type**. Pay attention to the information given in <<table-shipping-charges-calculation>>.
. Enter the shipping charge.
. **Save** the settings.

[[table-shipping-charges-calculation]]
.Table of shipping charges; calculation types
[cols="a,a"]
|====
|Calculation type |Explanation

|**Flat rate**
|Enter a flat rate charge, e.g. 6.00 EUR. Determine an item value starting from which shipping costs should be omitted (optional).

|**Weight-dependent**
|Enter a sliding scale. Shipping costs usually increase as the weight of the shipment increases. Make sure to enter the weight for each item later on. The heaviest weight entered will be the maximum weight that the customer can order.

|**Volume-dependent**
|Enter a sliding scale for volumes in cubic meters. Make sure to enter the measurements for each item later on.

|**Quantity-dependent**
|Enter a sliding scale. Shipping costs usually increase as the quantity of items increases.

|**Price-dependent**
|Enter a sliding scale. Determine the shipping costs that should apply up to each value of items.

|**Item shipping charge**
|Customers know this type of shipping charge from eBay. Selecting this option means that customers will pay a certain amount for the first item and a (usually lower) amount for each additional item. In addition, you can enter a flat rate charge, which will be applied starting from a certain value of items. Finally, you can determine the value of items starting from which shipping costs should be omitted completely.
|====

You can define upper and lower limits by entering data into the fields **Minimum value** and **Maximum value**. Also check whether you need shipping profiles that go beyond the defined upper and lower limits. For example, if you limit a shipping profile to the maximum value of 200 EUR, then you will need another shipping profile so that an order of more than 200 EUR can actually be delivered.

[#220]
=== Setting up payment methods

Set up payment methods so that customers can pay for their purchases in your online store.

[#230]
==== Activating payment methods

Go to <<order-processing/payment#, System » Orders » Payment » Payment methods>> to see and configure the payment methods that are currently integrated in plentymarkets. Some payment methods, e.g. cash in advance or invoice, can be used without the help of a payment provider. However, many payment methods in this menu will require you to work with a payment provider.

[TIP]
.Closing contracts with payment providers
====
It can take time to set up an interface with a payment provider. Decide which providers you want to work with and contact them as early as possible to avoid any delays.
====

The following <<order-processing/payment/managing-payment-methods#40, payment methods>> can be used without the help of a payment provider:

* Cash in advance
* Cash payment upon pickup
* Invoice
* Debit (manual processing is possible in most cases. Consult your local bank.)

[.instruction]
Activating payment methods:

. Go to **System » Orders » Payment » Methods**.
. Place a check mark next to the option **Also show inactive** since you have not activated any payment methods yet.
. Open the folders **International** and **DE**.
. Select the **Payment method** or **Payment provider** that you want to activate.
. Carry out the settings as desired. Pay attention to the information given in <<table-payment-method-options>>.
. Place a check mark next to the option **Active**.
. **Save** the settings.

[[table-payment-method-options]]
.Payment method options
[cols="a,a"]
|====
|Setting |Explanation

|**Name**
|Enter the name that should be displayed in the online store and on documents such as the invoice. +
You can specify the name of the payment provider or omit this information. For example, you can use the name "wirecard credit card" or simply "credit card" or "credit card (VISA &amp; Master)".

|**Priority**
|Select the priority to determine the order in which shipping profiles are displayed in the store checkout process.

|**Countries of delivery**
|Select the countries of delivery for the payment method. If new countries of delivery are activated later, then they must also be activated for the payment methods.

|**Domestic costs**,  +
**Foreign costs**
|Define surcharges for domestic and foreign shipping. The costs will be added to the normal shipping costs when the customer selects the payment method.

|**Flat rate or percentage**
|Enter the percentage value or flat rate value. The choice depends on the payment provider and the conditions of your contract. +
**Important**: Do not enter a value into both fields. For example, if for the payment method **Cash on delivery** you enter the value 4.00 into the field **Domestic (surcharge): Flat rate**, then the customer will have to pay a 4.00 EUR surcharge when selecting cash on delivery. If you enter the value 4.00 into the field **Domestic (surcharge): Percentage**, then a 4% surcharge will be calculated.

|**Logo**
|Use this function to insert a logo for the payment method.
|====

You have to configure additional settings beyond those listed in the table for <<order-processing/payment#, payment methods>> that require you to work with a payment provider (e.g. PayPal, Sofortbanking, wirecard etc.). For these payment methods, your online store will later transfer a payment request to the payment provider and receive a confirmation after the payment has been made.

[#240]
==== Setting up PayPal

This section uses <<order-processing/payment/paypal#, PayPal>> as an example for setting up a payment method with an interface. First, create an account on the link:https://www.paypal.com/uk/webapps/mpp/home[PayPal website^] and then allow the account to be used with plentymarkets. Enter the plentymarkets API account as well: jg_api1.plenty-shop.de

[#270]
== Setting up the online store

This chapter of the quick start provides information about the settings that need to be carried out in plentymarkets to set up the online store before you begin actively working with the system. It describes all the necessary steps such as building the item catalogue and creating the categories.

[#280]
=== Preparation

Here you will find information about the most important preliminary tasks for setting up the online store. This page also specifies which data will be needed for the quick start and the basic settings of your online store.

In addition, we have also created a video tutorial that covers the same topic:

video::190868520[vimeo]

[#290]
==== Define categories and subcategories

Categories help you structure your product portfolio and organise the items in your online store. Take a moment to think about which categories and subcategories you want to display in your online store. It is best to prepare this information in a document before you begin.

[#300]
==== Compile the terms and conditions

Compile your terms and conditions into a document. You can refer to standard texts when creating your terms and conditions. Have the texts checked by a specialised solicitor.

[#310]
==== Obtain a legally sound sample of customers' cancellation rights

Legally sound cancellation rights have to fulfil certain requirements with regards to form and content. Therefore, procure a current, legally sound sample.

The <<omni-channel/online-store/setting-up-clients/extras#, Services>> chapter lists several partners who can help you create legally sound texts.

[#320]
=== Setting up a catalogue of items

All items and variations are listed in the <<item/managing-items#, Item » Edit item>> menu. You can search for and edit the items here. In new plentymarkets systems, you will find some test items in this menu. Items can be edited directly in the list by clicking on the icons in the **Procedures** column. These procedures are described in <<table-procedures-item-overview>>. Use the filters on the left to search for items. These filters are described in further detail on the <<item/managing-items#350, Searching items and variations>> page. A bit of preparation is necessary before putting the first items into the system, e.g. deleting the sample items and creating categories and attributes.

[[table-procedures-item-overview]]
.Procedures in the item overview
[cols="a,a"]
|====
|Procedure |Explanation

|**Editing items**
|Open the **Global** tab of the item to edit the item's global data.

|**Visible in online store**
|Open the item in the online store.

|**Listing**
|If a listing is available, it will open and can be edited.

|**New listing**
|Open the **New market listing** window to create a listing for this item.
|====

[#330]
==== Deleting the test items

We recommend that you delete the test items saved in new plentymarkets systems since they are not part of your actual product portfolio. Test items are included in your system by default and are solely intended to help you understand plentymarkets. If you create additional test items and categories in your system and you do not want to use them in your actual product portfolio, delete this test data as well before you finish creating your catalogue.

[.instruction]
Deleting test items using the group function:

. Go to **Item » Edit item**.
. Set the **Active** filter to **ALL**.
. Click on **Search**. +
→ All items saved in the system will be displayed.
. Click on **Item group function**. +
→ The **Item group function** window will open.
. Activate the **Delete items** option.
. Click on **Execute**. +
→ All items will be deleted from the system.

[#340]
==== Defining the number of levels

plentymarkets can process up to six <<item/managing-categories#, navigation levels>>. However, to ensure user friendliness, most online stores limit themselves to a maximum of three levels, e.g. Computers &gt; Input devices &gt; Optical mice.

[.instruction]
Defining the number of levels:

. Go to **System » Client » Select client » Categories » Settings**.
. Select the **Maximum level for the category navigation** from the drop-down menu. +
→ For example, if you select **Level 4**, then it will not be possible to create a category on the fifth level.
. **Save** the settings.

[#350]
==== Sorting categories

<<omni-channel/online-store/setting-up-clients/item-layouts#, Categories are sorted>> when they are displayed in the online store. The categories can be sorted by position number, name (alphabetical order) or they can be displayed in random order.

[.instruction]
Selecting the sorting criteria:

. Go to **System » Client » Select client » Item layouts » Settings**.
. Select the **Sorting of item categories (level 1)** from the drop-down menu.
. Select the **Sorting of item categories (level 2)** from the drop-down menu. +
→ This sorting will also be used for lower category levels.
. **Save** the settings.

[TIP]
.Leave gaps between numbers if sorting by position number
====
If you decide to sort categories by position number, then make sure to enter these position numbers in your category settings. Instead of the numbers 1, 2, 3 etc., we recommend that you use two-digit numbers, i.e. 10, 20, 30, etc. This allows you to add more categories later without having to recreate the whole numbering system.
====

[#360]
==== Creating categories of the type Item

Create <<item/managing-categories#, categories>> of the type **Item** to sort your items. You can either create the categories now, as described below, or you can do this when you create items later. We recommend that you create all categories and subcategories now. This will help you structure and understand your product portfolio. +
Categories do not appear in the online store as soon as they are created. Rather, they become visible once the category is activated and an item has been added to the category. The item also needs to be visible in the online store. Your online store navigation is automatically generated from the categories in your system that have items assigned to them.

[.instruction]
Creating a new category:

. Go to **Item » Categories**.
. Click on **New category**. +
→ The **Create new category** window will open.
. Enter a name.
. Select the category type. +
→ If you activate **Subcategory**, then select the category that should include the new subcategory.
. Click on **Create**. +
→ The new category will be created and displayed in the category tree.

It is possible to create a subcategory on the third or fourth level. Simply click on the folder icon to open the main category. Then open the folders of the subcategories until you have reached the category that should include the new subcategory. Right-click on a category to open the context menu where you can edit the category or create further subcategories.

[#370]
==== Entering position numbers for categories

If you decide to sort categories by position number, then you will need to enter a position number for each category. If you decide to sort by a different criteria, then simply skip this chapter.

New categories are always given the position number 0.

[.instruction]
Entering the position number:

. Go to **Item » Categories**. Click on the category that should receive a different position number. +
→ The category's **Settings** tab will open.
. Enter a value for **Position**.
. **Save** the settings.

Reload the menu once you have entered a position number for each category. Any open categories will close automatically.

[#380]
==== Assigning the category to a client

A category of the type **Item** will only be displayed in the online store if it is linked to at least one item that is visible in the store and if the category is assigned to a client. You can also assign a category to several clients.

[.instruction]
Assigning the category to a client:

. Go to **Item » Categories**. Click on the category that you want to assign. +
→ The category's **Settings** tab will open.
. Activate the **client (store)**.
. **Save** the settings.

[#390]
==== Displaying the category names in the browser tab

Enter a meta title if you want the category name to be displayed in the browser tab.

[.instruction]
Displaying the category names in the browser tab:

. Go to **Item » Categories**. Click on the category that you want to edit. +
→ The category's **Settings** tab will open.
. Enter a **meta title**.
. **Save** the settings.

[#400]
==== Creating attributes

Attributes are used in plentymarkets to create variations. Variations are different versions of an item. Variations differ in one way or several ways but are otherwise the same item. An example would be an item that is available in three different colours. The customer should be able to choose from these three variations when ordering. In plentymarkets, you do not need to create a new item for each variation. Instead, you can enter <<item/managing-items#390, attributes>> and assign them to an item. An example for creating the attribute **Colour** is given below.

[.instruction]
Creating the attribute "Colour":

. Go to **System » Item » Attributes**.
. Click on the **New attribute** tab.
. Enter information into the fields **Name** and **Name (internal)**, e.g. Colour.  +
→ The entry under **Name** will be displayed in the online store later.
. **Save** the settings. +
→ The new attribute is added to the list.
. Expand the attribute.
. Open the **Values** tab.
. Enter the values for this attribute.
. **Save** the settings.

[#410]
==== Entering item availability texts and delivery times

You are legally required to provide information in your online store about how long it takes to deliver all items that can't be shipped immediately. In plentymarkets, you manage this information using a ten-stage notification system. Information about availability is indicated by a symbol and an availability text in the online store.

In the menu **System » Item » Availability**, you will find default texts that have already been saved for the different levels of availability. You can make changes to the texts that are saved there. Typical availability texts are e.g. "ships within 24 hours" or "ships within 3-5 business days". You can also upload your own symbols and use them instead of the default symbols. For further information, refer to <<item/managing-items#180, Setting the availability>>.

[IMPORTANT]
.Select the availability carefully
====
Carefully consider whether you want to enter a very short delivery period, e.g. 24 hours, since you can be held liable for it. You have to keep the promises that you make to your customers. Also keep in mind that this content will be analysed and displayed by search engines.
====

[#420]
==== Creating items

The items and item variations that you sell are the foundation of your business. You need to create an item before you can add variations to it. You will learn how to add variations to an item in a later chapter. First, you need to create the main item in the menu <<item/managing-items#, Item » Edit item>>.

. **Save** the settings. +
→ The default category will be set.

[#440]
==== Creating variations

A main variation is always created when a new item is created. The main variation is linked to an item. It cannot be deleted. Information saved for the main variation, such as sales prices and availability, is passed on to item variations. However, you can change the settings of every variation individually. First, learn how to create variations.

[.instruction]
Creating new variations:

. Go to **Item » Edit item**.

[#470]
==== Automating the availability information in the online store

If you work with the stock function in plentymarkets, then you can fully automate the availability information that is displayed in your online store. In this case, your online store automatically sets the symbols **available** and **not available** depending on your current stock. Alternatively, items that are not in stock can also be hidden completely (set to **invisible**). Additionally, instruct plentymarkets to show the items again (set to **visible**) as soon as they are back in stock.

[.instruction]
Automating the availability information:

. Go to **Item » Edit item**.
. Open the item. +
→ The tab of the main variation will open.
. Select the **To net stock** option from the **Limitation** drop-down menu in the **Availability** area.
. Activate the following options under **Availability**: +

**Store: invisible if net stock is 0 or negative**.
. **Save** the settings.

Item <<item/managing-items#180, availability>> changes continuously. This makes it necessary to constantly update the information, which is generally very time consuming. Of course, you can manually update the availability of your items in the beginning. However, you should think about implementing a more efficient solution in the future. If you already manage the availability of your items somewhere else (e.g. in an external stock management software) or if you obtain such information electronically from your wholesaler, then plentymarkets can import this information. The import may take a little bit of preparatory work.

[NOTE]
.Is an import possible?
====
If you have already created a database or if you can export item data from another system, then you should check the <<basics/data-exchange/importing-data#, import options>> before entering data manually. Data can be imported into plentymarkets with a CSV file. This may require a bit of preparatory work. Your plentymarkets system also offers several convenient interfaces to popular software solutions.

[#480]
==== Managing item images

Use the item's <<item/managing-items#90, Images>> tab to save images for the item and link these images to the variations of this item. You can upload up to 25 images per item. These images can be in JPG/JPEG or PNG format. You should upload the first image, i.e. the main image, in **JPG** format because this image will be used for eBay.

[.instruction]
Saving images for an item:

. Go to **Item » Edit item**.
. Open the item.
. Open the item's **Images** tab.
. Drag and drop new images into the **Insert a new image** area. Alternatively, click on **Select files**.
. From the dropdown list **Availability**, select the clients and/or referrers for which you want do use the image.
. **Save** the settings.

==== Linking images with variations

Now, link the images saved for the item with one or more of its variations. To do so, proceed as described below.

[.instruction]
Linking item images with variations:

. Go to **Item » Edit item**.
. Open the item.
. Open the item's **Images** tab. +
→ A preview of all images saved for the item is displayed.
. Place a check mark on the left for those images that you want to link with one or more of the variations.
. Click on **Variation link**. +
→ The **Link variations** window is displayed.
. Select the variations that you want to link with the selected images.
. Click on **Link**. +
→ The images are linked with the selected variations.

If you prefer to store the item images on an external server or on your own webspace, you can also use the **URL** field to link the externally stored images with the items. This is an alternative to the procedure described above.

Larger quantities of images should be transferred to the server via <<item/managing-items#680, FTP upload>>. Choose image names carefully to avoid mistakes when assigning the images to items. Generally, it is possible to use the item ID or the item number with the file extension **.jpg** or **.png**.

[#490]
==== Managing files and videos

Use the item's <<item/managing-items#110, Media>> tab to save files that you want to make available for customers to download in the **My account** area of the online store. The files will be displayed along with the item in the order overview. These files can be product information, item data sheets or even videos.

[.instruction]
Uploading files and making them available:

. Go to **Item » Edit item**.
. Open the item.
. Click on the **Media** tab.
. Drag and drop new files into the **Insert a new document** area. Alternatively, click on **Select files**.
. Activate the areas where the files should be available.
. **Save** the settings.

For further information about the permitted file formats, file sizes and number of files, as well as information about inserting download links into the CMS, refer to the <<item/managing-items#110, Media>> page of the manual.

[#500]
==== Adding cross-selling items

<<item/managing-items#950, Cross-selling>> is a way to offer your customers additional items from your product range that are a necessary extension or reasonable supplement for your customer’s current selection. The right batteries are needed for a torch, for example. A digital camera only makes sense in combination with a memory card that has sufficient capacity. A customer who buys a premium tennis racket is likely to invest in a nice bag to store the racket in. If such connections also exist with your items, then you can use the **cross-selling** option to set up associations between them and benefit from additional sales.

The following requirements have to be met in order for direct **cross-selling items** to be displayed in your online store:

* The category of the cross-selling item has to be activated.
* The items have to be visible in the online store.

.setting up cross-selling items
image::basics/first-steps/assets/EN-Quick-Start-09.png[]

[.instruction]
Adding cross-selling items:

. Go to **Item » Edit item**.
. Open the item.
. Open the **Cross-selling » Add item(s)** tab.
. Place check marks next to the items that you want to add as cross-selling items.
. Select the appropriate **relation**, e.g. **Similar**. +
→ The items are added and displayed in the **Cross-selling items** tab.

You can change the relationship of the cross-selling items in the **Cross-selling items** tab. You can also delete the cross-selling link here.

[#510]
==== Setting up dynamic cross-selling

Cross-selling links can also be created automatically in plentymarkets. This happens when items are bought together.

[.instruction]
Setting up dynamic cross-selling:

. Go to **System » Client » Select client » Online store » Settings**.
. Select **Use direct cross-selling** for the **Cross-selling** option.
. Select the option **Yes** for **Dynamic cross-selling**.
. **Save** the settings.

[#520]
=== Designing the online store pages

Next, you will learn how to design your online store and add content to it.

[NOTE]
.Opening a preview of the online store
====
Click on the **globe** (Website) in the header of the plentymarkets admin area. Your online store will open in a new window.
====

Your online store will be displayed with a fully functional test design. You can change the design and add to it according to your needs. To do so, select one of the default designs available in the <<omni-channel/online-store/setting-up-clients/cms#, CMS>> menu. If you want to have a highly customised design, you can work with one of our link:https://www.plentymarkets.eu/partner/zertifizierte-agenturen/[certified service providers^].

This guide provides explanations for working with the default design and focuses primarily on inserting texts, images and links. At minimum, you will need to have a **homepage** and additional pages containing **contact** and **shipping** information as well as a **legal disclosure** and a **privacy policy**. You are not legally required to have a page of **terms and conditions**, but we strongly recommend that you do so because of the security that it provides.

[#530]
==== Editing categories of the type Content

**Categories** of the type **Content** are used to create and manage the pages of your online store. Your plentymarkets test system comes with a number of default categories that have already been created. You can find them in the menu **Item » Categories**. We recommend that you add even more content to your online store and edit the following categories:

.Online store pages recommended for the quick start
[cols="a,a"]
|====
|Category |Explanation

|**Homepage**
|This is usually the first page that customers will see when they enter your online store. It gives them a first impression. Therefore, create the content very carefully.

|**Contact**
|Change the texts here or adopt the suggestions. This page is accessible via the navigation bar.

|**Legal disclosure** (required by law in some countries)
|Save mandatory entries according to current legal requirements. This page is accessible via the navigation bar.

|**Shipping costs**
|Edit to match your shipping cost model. This page is accessible via the navigation bar and the **Plus shipping costs** link found in the detailed information about every item in the online store. +
**Tip:** Keep this information as simple as possible since you do not want to scare off potential customers.

|**Payment methods**
|Edit to match your payment methods. This page is accessible via the navigation bar. +
**Tip**: PayPal, credit cards and debit cards are some of the most popular payment methods in the UK.

|**Cancellation rights**
|Accessible in the order process. This content is legally binding. It is best to use the current legal sample. Do not forget to provide your return address.

|**Privacy policy**
|Save mandatory entries according to current legal requirements. This page is accessible via the navigation bar.

|**Terms and conditions**
|Accessible via the navigation bar and in the order process. When creating your terms and conditions, refer to standard texts and have them checked by a specialised solicitor.

|**Bank details**
|Accessible in the order process to customers who select the payment method **Cash in advance**. It is possible to enter several accounts (domestic and foreign).

|**Item not found**
|This message appears when customers search for an item that is not found in the online store. e.g. because the item is no longer available.

|**404**
|Customers see the HTTP status code 404 when searching for a page or file that is no longer available.

|**Help**
|Help for the order process. Change the texts here or adopt the suggestions.
|====

[#540]
==== Categories of the type Content: Editing texts

All <<item/managing-categories#, categories>> of the type **Content** can be edited in the same way. This quick start uses the **homepage** to illustrate all of the necessary steps.

The integrated <<omni-channel/online-store/setting-up-clients/cms#web-design-tools-editor, editor>> is used to format all texts in your plentymarkets system. It is handled just like a word processing software. New texts can be entered by typing them in or by inserting them using the clipboard. Click on the import icon to insert texts from Word or similar software without the superfluous code. All texts can be manually formatted with the editor's icons. Alternatively, you can use the predefined styles (recommended) to create a consistent layout. All of these templates can be changed in one central location later on. Global changes, e.g. font size or colour, will automatically be transferred to all of the text passages that are linked to these templates.

In particular, use the templates **Heading 1** to **Heading 3** to mark and highlight important text passages for search engines. For better readability of your texts, you should distinguish between **ENTER** for a new paragraph and **SHIFT+ENTER** for a new line.

[IMPORTANT]
.Changing styles
====
Editing the styles requires some knowledge of CSS. They can be edited in the **CSSContent** template of the **CMS » Web design » Layout » CSS** menu. Edit this template carefully and only after you have saved the original template. This will allow you to restore it should this become necessary.
====

[.instruction]
Editing categories of the type Content:

. Go to **Item » Categories**.
. Click on the category **callisto_light_3_5** in the directory tree on the left. → The category will open.
. Click on the category **Homepage**. +
→ The category will open.
. Make sure that the category type **Content** is selected in the **Settings** tab.
. Click on the **Description 1** tab.
. Edit the content to meet your needs.
. **Save** the settings.

[#550]
==== Categories of the type Content: Inserting images

Images have to be uploaded to the webserver before they can be inserted into categories. Images can be uploaded in a category's <<item/managing-categories#10, Documents>> tab. Alternatively, images can be uploaded in the menu <<omni-channel/online-store/setting-up-clients/cms#image-gallery, CMS » Image gallery>>. Proceed as described below to upload and define category images.

[.instruction]
Uploading and defining category images:

. Go to **Item » Categories**.
. Open the category.
. Click on the **Documents** tab.
. Upload the image by clicking on **Upload files** or by using the drag &amp; drop function.
. Point your cursor over the image.
. Place a check mark next to the image.
. Click on **Define image 1**.
. **Save** the settings. +
→ The image will be outlined in red and designated with the number 1.

Upload the second category image the same way and click on **Define image 2**. Deselect a category image by placing a check mark for the image and clicking on **Define image 1** or **Define image 2** a second time.

It is not possible to click on a button that is greyed out in the toolbar until you have selected one or more images. By selecting images with check marks, you can see a preview, download or delete several images at the same time.

[NOTE]
.Displaying category images in the online store
====
Only image 1 is displayed in the online store by default. An <<omni-channel/online-store/setting-up-clients/cms-syntax#basics-if, if-query>> was added to the **ItemViewCategoriesList** template with the template variable <<omni-channel/online-store/setting-up-clients/cms-syntax#web-design-navigation, $CurrentCategoryImageUrl>>. You have to add a second if-query to the template in order for image 2 to be displayed.
====

[#560]
==== Categories of the type Content: Inserting text links

It is also possible to insert links into your categories.

A text-based link consists of two parts: the visible part of the link, i.e. the title or anchor text, and the invisible target of the link. You create a link by highlighting any text and saving a target for it. In plentymarkets, you can do this using just one command from your editor window.

An example of a valid target address is https://www.google.co.uk/. This is an external target. If you want to create links to internal pages of your online store, then use template variables and functions to specify the target of a link.

The following example teaches you how to create an internal text link from the homepage to a category.

[.instruction]
Inserting a text link:

. Go to **Item » Categories**.
. Open the category you want to link to. +
→ The category ID is displayed in the upper toolbar. In our example, this is the ID 3. Note the ID.
. Copy the URL function, i.e. your link's target. In this case, this is **{% Link(3) %}**.
. Open the homepage.
. Click on the **Description 1** tab.
. Click on the desired location and enter a suitable text, e.g. "Open link...".
. Highlight the text.
. Click on **Link** in the middle toolbar. +
→ The **Link** window will open.
. Insert the content (i.e. the link's target as a template function) into the **URL** field.
. Select **&lt;other&gt;** as the **Protocol**.
. Click on **OK**.
. **Save** the settings.

For external targets, enter the absolute URL into the **URL** field and select a **protocol**, e.g. https://.

It is also possible to insert text links directly into the source code. Simply open the category, click on **Description 1** and click on **Source** in the middle toolbar. The following examples show the source code for an external link that opens in a new tab and for an internal text link that opens in the same tab in the browser.

* External link +
**&lt;a href="https://www.plentymarkets.co.uk/"target="_blank"&gt;plentymarkets&lt;/a&gt;**
* Internal text link +
**&lt;a href="https://www.plentymarkets.co.uk/"Settings&lt;/a&gt;**

You can also link individual items as the target of a link. These can also be inserted using <<omni-channel/online-store/setting-up-clients/cms-syntax#web-design, template variables and functions>>. The following table lists several important template functions:

.Important template functions
[cols="a,a"]
|====
|Template function |Meaning

|**{% Link_Home() %}**
|URL to the homepage

|**{% Link(3) %}**
|URL of the category (Content or Item) with the ID 3 (see <<item/managing-categories#, Item » Categories>>).

|**{% Link_Printout(3) %}**
|URL to the print version of the category with the ID 3

|**{% Link_Item(100) %}**
|URL to the detailed view of the item with the ID 100

|**{% Link_ImageList(100) %}**
|URL to the image list of the item with the ID 100

|**{% Link_Basket() %}**
|URL of the shopping cart

|**{% Link_MyAccount() %}**
|URL of the "My account" area

|**{% Link_Checkout() %}**
|URL to the checkout
|====

You can also use fixed template functions instead of the category's ID for default categories such as the terms and conditions. For example, the template function for the terms and conditions is **{% Link_TermsConditions() %}**.

[#570]
==== Categories of the type Content: Inserting image links

Link the image instead of a text for image-based links. In other words, the title or anchor text is omitted and replaced by an image. Proceed as described below to link an image with an external target.

[.instruction]
Inserting an image link:

. Go to **Item » Categories**.
. Open the category in which you want to display the image.
. Click on the **Documents** tab.
. Upload the image by clicking on **Upload files** or by using the drag &amp; drop function.
. **Save** the settings.
. Copy the image path.
. Click on the **Description 1** tab.
. Place your cursor where you want the image to appear.
. Click on **Image** in the middle toolbar. +
→ The **Image Properties** window will open.
. Click on the **Image Info** tab and insert the image path under **URL**. +
→ Specify the image size if needed.
. Click on the **Link** tab and enter the URL that you want to link to. +
→ **Important**: Enter the protocol, e.g. https://.
. Use the **Target** drop-down menu to specify whether the link should open in a new window.
. Click on **OK**.
. **Save** the settings.
. Make sure your settings are correctly displayed in the online store.

[#580]
=== Setting up the online store

You have now created the catalogue of items and set up the categories. There are only a few settings left before your online store can begin generating revenue.

[#590]
==== Selecting the URL structure

Use the settings in the **System » Client » Select client » SEO » URL structure** menu to influence the **structure of category and item URLs** in your online store. The URL structure is relevant for search engine optimisation (SEO). In general, the URL should contain information that is relevant for finding your items. Avoid overloading your online store URL with information. If a URL is too long and contains too many keywords, search engines might interpret it as forbidden manipulation.

No one can say with absolute certainty what the ideal balance is between providing a short URL and one that contains a wealth of detail. Read through the **SEO** chapter before you decide on a URL structure for your online store. It explains the different components that make up a URL and illustrates various types of URLs. This will help you or your search engine advisor make an informed decision.

[.instruction]
Selecting the URL structure:

. Go to **System » Client » Select client » SEO » URL structure » Item**.
. Carry out the settings as desired. Pay attention to the information given in <<table-settings-url-structure-menu>>.
. **Save** the settings. +
→ The process may take some time.
. Close your online store and open it again so that the changes can take effect.

[[table-settings-url-structure-menu]]
.Settings within the *URL structure* menu
[cols="a,a"]
|====
|Setting |Explanation

|**Item URL structure**
|Select the item URL structure. The item URL can contain information such as item name and category name.

|**Page name of item page**
|Select the name of item page. The page name will be displayed as the meta title in the browser tab.

|**Source for item name**
|Select **Name 1**, **Name 2** or **Name 3**. The name will be used for the two previous settings. For further information about changing item names, refer to <<item/managing-items#90, Entering item texts>>.
|====

[#600]
==== Publishing the design

If you have made changes to the URL structure, then you will have to publish the design and all categories in order to activate the changes. The design that is active in your online store will be displayed in green in the <<omni-channel/online-store/setting-up-clients/cms#web-design, CMS » Web design>> menu once it has been published.

[.instruction]
Publishing the design:

. Go to **CMS » Web design**.
. Select the design from the drop-down menu.
. Select the language.
. Click on **Publish design**. +
→ The **Publish design** window will open.
. Use the **Publish selected elements** area to select which parts of the design should be published. Pay attention to the information given in <<table-options-publishing-design>>.
. Click on **Publish selected elements**. +
→ The selected elements will be published. The process can take several minutes depending on the volume of data.

[[table-options-publishing-design]]
.Options for publishing the design
[cols="a,a"]
|====
|Setting |Explanation

|**All**
|Select this option to publish the entire design including all categories and blog entries.

|**Templates &amp; CSS**
|Select this option to only publish the templates and the CSS.

|**Categories**
|Select this option to publish categories that were imported via interfaces or import formats but were not yet published. If you make changes to categories that were already published, then these changes will go into effect immediately. You are not required to publish the categories again.

|**Blog**
|Select this option to publish blog entries that were imported via interfaces or import formats but were not yet published. If you make changes to blog entries that were already published, then these changes will go into effect immediately. You are not required to publish the blog entries again. It is also possible to publish blog entries in the menu <<omni-channel/online-store/setting-up-clients/cms#blog-weblog, CMS » Blog>>.
|====

You will need to clear the file cache if you publish the design a second time and you want to see the changes immediately. The quick start does not teach you how to clear the file cache since it focuses on publishing the design for the first time. For further information, refer to the <<omni-channel/online-store/setting-up-clients/cms#web-design-editing-the-web-design, Editing the web design>> page of the manual.

[#610]
==== Entering a name for your online store

Enter a name for your online store in the menu <<omni-channel/online-store/setting-up-clients#basic-settings, System » Client » Select client » Settings>>. This menu also displays additional basic data such as your online store ID, domain and default language.

[#620]
==== Carrying out basic settings for your online store

Configure settings for your online store in the menu <<omni-channel/online-store/setting-up-clients/online-store#, System » Client » Select client » Online store » Settings>>.

.**Standard » Online store » Basic settings** menu
[cols="a,a"]

|Select the HTML version for the online store. +
**__Note:__** You have to work very accurately if you select **XHTML** since XHTML does not accept faulty codes as easily as HTML.

|**Request security code in contact forms**
|Decide whether to use a security code in contact forms.

|**Precautionary statement in case of overselling**
|Select **Active** to display a precautionary statement in the order process if the order quantity exceeds the net stock of the item. The purchaser will be informed that the delivery may be delayed. +

[#630]
==== Specifying number formats for prices, weights etc.

In the *System » Settings » Numbers* menu, you can carry out settings to specify the number formats. For example, you can specify how many decimal places should be used for dimensions and weights. Typical values are already saved by default.

include::{includedir}/number-formats.adoc[]

[#640]
==== Entering SEO meta data

The settings in the menu **System » Client » Select client » SEO » Meta data** are relevant for search engine optimisation. Meta data is information on a web page that is accessible to search engines but is invisible (or only indirectly visible) to visitors.

The basic data you enter here will be complemented by further information entered on other pages, e.g. the detailed views of your items. The amount of information that should to be provided in this general part also depends on how detailed and descriptive your categories and item names are. Therefore, no general advice can be given. We recommend that you consult an expert in search engine optimisation or independently observe the listing of your pages in search engines on a regular basis.

In general, it is important not to waste space in the meta data with unspecific texts such as **Welcome to our homepage**. Instead, you should think about the most important search terms and possible synonyms or alternative spellings in advance.

The most important entry for search engines is the page title, since search engines give it special preference. Page titles will only be processed up to a certain length and longer titles will be cut off. Therefore, position important keywords at the front of the title (&lt; 60 characters). The page title is usually displayed in search results and seen by potential customers.

[.instruction]
Entering SEO meta data:

. Go to **System » Client » Select client » SEO » Meta data**.
. Enter the **page title** and **keywords**. Pay attention to the information given in <<table-meta-data-menu>>.
. **Save** the settings.

[IMPORTANT]
.Cheating will be penalised
====
Search engines can ban you from the index without prior warning if they suspect you of cheating. If you systematically cluster keywords here or elsewhere, you risk being penalised by search engines. Think of search engines as your partners and choose search terms responsibly.

[#650]
==== Customising the order process

In the <<omni-channel/online-store/setting-up-clients/order-process#, System » Client » Select client » Order process » Settings>> menu, you can customise the order process of your online store. You can decide whether many of these options should be displayed to store visitors or not.

.**Order process » Basic settings menu**
[cols="a,a"]
|====
|Setting |Explanation

|**Standard country of delivery**
|Choose from the <<order-processing/fulfilment/preparing-the-shipment#100, countries of delivery>> that you set up in the menu **System » Orders » Shipping » Settings » Countries of delivery**. They are assigned based on the language here.

|**Default shipping method, +
Default shipping profile, +
Default payment method**
|Select which settings are offered by default. You already carried out these settings during the first part of the quick start, see <<basics/first-steps/quick-start#250, Payment and shipping priorities>>.

|**Unit price**
|**Hide item's unit price** = The unit price is not displayed in the order process. +
**Show the item's unit price in the order process if the content is larger than 0** = The unit price is displayed for items that have an entry saved in the <<item/managing-items#270, Content>> field within the variation's tab (= content is larger than zero). +
For further information about specifying unit prices in online stores, refer to link:https://www.haendlerbund.de/hinweisblaetter/finish/1-hinweisblaetter/114-grundpreisangabe-im-online-handel[Händlerbund^] (German website).

|**Newsletter registration during order process**
|Do you want the newsletter registration to be activated by default? It is legally risky to have the **newsletter registration** preselected in the online store (to automatically register customers for the newsletter if they do **not** delete the check mark during the order process). Therefore, procure information on the current legal practice or consult a specialised solicitor before activating an automatic registration.

|**Minimum order value**
|Enter the global minimum order value. The order value is calculated based on the gross value of the items ordered.

|====
|Setting |Explanation

2+|Basic settings

|**Customer login**
|Customers can either log into your online store with their **email address and password** or with their **customer ID and password**. Most online stores ask for the email address, so that customers do not have to search for their customer ID before logging in. However, the problem with this solution is that many customers have several addresses and change them occasionally.

|**Hide logout**
|**Yes** = The logout button will not be displayed. +
**No** = The logout button will be displayed (recommended).

2+|Order information

|**Status history, +

|The current order status and the shipping date can be displayed to the customer in the **My account** area.

|**Invoices**
|Invoices can be provided for the customer in the **My account** area (recommended).

==== Setting up multilingualism

In plentymarkets, you can set up the order process, the complete store layout and the item descriptions in multiple languages. In the <<omni-channel/online-store/setting-up-clients/multilingual-online-store#, System » Client » Select client » Online store » Multilingualism>> menu, you can decide whether the entire online store or only the order process should be multilingual. Do not forget to translate and insert these texts.

You can create and save the names and descriptions of an item in different languages. This is done in the item's <<item/managing-items#90, Texts>> tab. You can also create <<item/managing-categories#, categories>> and the <<omni-channel/online-store/setting-up-clients/cms#web-design, online store design>> in different languages. Carry out the language settings in the **Multilingualism** menu as described below.

[.instruction]
Setting up language options:

. Go to **System » Client » Select client » Online store » Multilingualism**.
. Carry out the settings as desired. Pay attention to the information given in <<table-settings-multilingualism-menu>>.
. **Save** the settings.

**Items &amp; layout &amp; content pages &amp; order process** = The entire online store is activated for multilingualism.

|**Languages**
|Select the languages for multilingualism. For example, activate the options **English** and **German** to set German as a language in addition to the default language English.

|**Automatic language recognition**
|Select a **store language** for all other browser languages. The online store is opened in a specific language, i.e. in the **same language as the browser**. +
**Important**: If a browser language is not recognised or is not included in the list, then the online store will be opened in the language that was selected for the option **Default** under **Browser language**. We recommend using the language English as standard. If no language was selected or if the setting **no change** was selected, then the store will be opened in its default language.

=== Checklist

Use the following checklist to double check the settings. Work through the checklist once you have carried out all of the previously described settings. This will ensure that your plentymarkets system functions correctly.

❏ Did you set up the <<basics/first-steps/quick-start#320, catalogue of items>> including all descriptions?

❏ Did you customise the <<basics/first-steps/quick-start#410, item availability>> texts?

❏ Is the <<basics/first-steps/quick-start#410, item availability>> correct?

❏ Did you double check all <<basics/first-steps/quick-start#420, prices and VAT entries>>?

❏ Did you find reasonable <<basics/first-steps/quick-start#500, cross-selling>> links for your items?

❏ Did you enter information into all of the important categories of the type <<basics/first-steps/quick-start#530, Content>> for your online store?

❏ Do the <<basics/first-steps/quick-start#650, shipping information and shipping costs>> match the settings in the system?

❏ Do the legal disclosure and privacy policy contain all of the necessary information?

❏ Read through your terms and conditions again carefully and have them checked by a specialist.

❏ Place several test orders with different payment methods and shipping settings. Check whether the shipping costs have been calculated correctly by the system.

[#690]
== Setting up automatic processes

This chapter provides information about the settings that need to be carried out in plentymarkets to set up automatic processes before you begin actively working with the system. The system then completes these automatic processes in the background.

In plentymarkets, there are four different tools that help you automate tasks:

* Email templates. plentymarkets uses templates to automatically send emails to your customers later on.
* Event procedures. Specific events in the online store automatically trigger certain procedures.
* Procedure manager. Recurring events can be taken care of automatically by the procedure manager and carried out at specific times.
* <<basics/automation/processes#, Processes>>. You are only able to set up processes if you have installed the plentymarkets Client. This feature is intended for advanced plentymarkets users. As such, processes are not included in the quick start.

Learn more about editing a customer data record in the following video tutorial:

[#700]
=== Managing orders

This chapter teaches you how to work with orders in plentymarkets. The goal is to help you understand how automatic processes work and why they are useful.

In plentymarkets, you will see a list of all the orders that were generated on all of the different platforms. No matter where or how a customer purchased an item from you, whether in the online store, on Amazon or in an eBay listing - plentymarkets will always generate a new order in your order folder. You can then edit this order the same way.

Orders all have a status, which indicates how much of the fulfilment process has been completed. A new order that contains all of the necessary data but has not been paid for will always receive **status 3 - waiting for payment**. As soon as the payment is received and has been booked by the system, the **status** will change to **5 - cleared for shipping**. The order can now be prepared and shipped. Once you have shipped the items that the customer ordered and paid for, the order will be completed and set to **status 7 - outgoing items booked**.

Every order will at least pass through the statuses 3, 5 and 7. However, orders can also pass through other statuses as well. For example, if an order has already been paid for but you do not have the actual item in stock, then **status 4 - waiting for stock** can be used. If an item has already been cleared for shipping (**status 5**) but it has not yet been sent (**status 7**), then you can use **status 6** to indicate that the items are being picked and packed.

If a customer pays for the order with a credit card, then the order will only remain in status 3 for a short period of time until the incoming payment has been confirmed and the status has been set to 5. The status will be changed directly to 5 instead of 3 if you allow your customers to purchase on invoice. With this payment method, the outgoing items are shipped before the incoming payment is received.

[TIP]
.Status options
====
These status options are especially important when configuring event procedures and the procedure manager.

[#710]
=== Sending emails automatically

In the chapter <<basics/first-steps/quick-start#10, Initial settings>>, you learned how to create new email templates and edit existing templates. Now you will learn how plentymarkets sends these email templates automatically.

In the menu <<crm/sending-emails#2300, System » Client » Select client » Email » Automatic>>, you can choose which email template should be sent in specific situations. For example, it makes sense to automatically send the email template **Confirmation of a store order** whenever an order is placed in the online store. As such, select this email template in the line **Order confirmation after checkout**. You can also save other specific order confirmations in this menu. For example, for orders that come from eBay, Amazon or other markets. Furthermore, you can select an email template that sends the customer a new password upon request and another one confirming newsletter registration. We also recommend that you create and use the templates **customer registration** and **reminder in case of aborted purchase**.

Of course, you should only select those email templates that you have finished editing and that contain your personal header and contact details. If you have not yet entered the necessary information into a template or if you have not finished creating an email template, then keep the default setting **do not send**.

[#720]
=== Using event procedures to automate routine jobs

Online stores carry out many routine jobs every day. Processing and editing incoming orders is complex and requires a systematic approach. After having received an order confirmation, customers also appreciate additional emails that provide information about the status of their order.

In plentymarkets, many routine jobs can be carried out automatically with the help of the event procedures found in the menu <<basics/automation/event-procedures#, System » Orders » Events>>. This allows you to operate your online store very efficiently and save time that you can invest in other things.

Two steps need to be carried out to activate an event procedure. First, use various filter options to define an event. Second, decide which procedures the system should carry out when this event occurs. The system will automatically carry out the defined procedure whenever this event occurs in the future.

It is possible to set up any number of different event procedures in plentymarkets. Below, you will find examples for setting up four event procedures that are beneficial to most online stores.

[#730]
==== Example 1: Automatically sending the invoice

Set up an <<basics/automation/event-procedures#, event procedure>> to automatically send the customer an email with the invoice in PDF format as soon as the invoice is generated in the system.

[IMPORTANT]
.Did you create the document template?
====
Make sure that you have created a document template including your bank details for the invoices you send.

====

[#740]
==== Example 2: Automatically sending the partial payment confirmation

Everyone with a little experience in eBusiness likely knows the following problem: instead of transferring the correct amount of money, the customer has accidentally paid a lower amount. When this happens, you need to notify the customer and ask him or her to transfer the outstanding amount. In plentymarkets, you can simply define an <<basics/automation/event-procedures#, event procedure>> to automatically process such cases without wasting a lot of time or effort.

====

[TIP]
.Synchronisation is carried out automatically
====
When incoming payments are booked, your plentymarkets system compares the amount paid with the required amount and is therefore able to automatically recognise a **partial payment**.
====

[#750]
==== Example 3: Automatically sending the full payment confirmation for cash in advance

Customers show their trust when they choose the payment method **cash in advance**. This is because they are theoretically taking some risk. Therefore, it is understandable that customers who choose this payment method will be somewhat impatient while waiting to hear back from you. We recommend that you set up another <<basics/automation/event-procedures#, event procedure>> to automatically respond to this payment method.

[#760]
==== Example 4: Automatically confirming shipment after package numbers are imported

Online stores have to complete a variety of daily tasks in order to process their orders. The last task is usually shipping packages. The package numbers generated during this process should now be reported back to plentymarkets. This is because the package numbers are used for other event procedures that are necessary for processing orders.

[TIP]
.Tip: Automating the import of package numbers
====
There are several different ways to import package numbers into plentymarkets: You can fill out forms much quicker with the help of a USB scanner. If you process a large number of shipments, then we recommend that you import these entries from your shipping software into the system.
====

When package numbers are imported, this next <<basics/automation/event-procedures#, event procedure>> sends a shipping confirmation, changes the order status to 7 and books the outgoing items from the warehouse, thus updating the physical stock.

If **Warehouse** is selected, the contact person of the warehouse will receive the email template. If a certain user is selected, this user in your plentymarkets system will receive the email.
====

Nowadays, nearly all shipping service providers allow customers to track packages online. You already saved a tracking URL while setting up your shipping service providers. Once the package number has been entered, your plentymarkets system has all of the necessary information to send customers a tracking URL for their package. Use this option and make sure that the shipping confirmation email contains the variable **$TrackingURL**. You should also test the first tracking URLs yourself to ensure that they have been processed correctly and that the customer has all the information.

[TIP]
.Tip: Use flags
====
We recommend that you use flags to help you keep track of the orders in your order folder. You will have to define the meaning of the flags yourself and use them consistently afterwards. For example, you can use an event procedure to assign **flag 5** to orders that are partially paid for. Then you will be able to recognise this status right away when you open the order overview later on. Flags can either be saved manually or automatically. Save flags automatically by setting up an event procedure with the procedure type **Change flag**. These flags can be used to filter (select) orders in event procedures and throughout the entire system.

[#770]
=== Using the procedure manager to automate routine jobs

plentymarkets can automatically carry out certain procedures for you with the procedure manager. Two examples will now be used to explain how the procedure manager works. In the first example, you will learn how to set up automatic eBay feedback. In the second example, you will learn how to configure the automatic dunning process.

[#780]
==== Example 1: Posting feedback automatically on eBay

Posting feedback on eBay is a time-consuming, routine job. This is why we are going use the procedure manager to post feedback automatically. Whenever your customer gives you positive feedback, the <<basics/automation/procedure-manager#, procedure manager>> will respond by giving your eBay customer positive feedback as well.

[.instruction]
Using the procedure manager to automatically give feedback on eBay:

. Go to **System » Orders » Procedures**.
. Click on the **New procedure** tab.
. Place a check mark next to the option **Active** to activate the procedure.
. Select a time from the **Execute every day at** drop-down menu.
. Enter a **name** for the procedure.
. Click on the **Filter** tab.
. Select the **positive feedback received** option from the **eBay** drop-down menu. +
→ Irrelevant settings will be greyed out.
. Click on the **Procedure** tab.
. Select the **give positive feedback** option from the **eBay** drop-down menu.
. **Save** the settings.

The procedure has now been set up. However, you still have to write the feedback texts before you can "post feedback". Go to <<omni-channel/multi-channel/ebay#65, System » Markets » eBay » Settings » Tab: Account settings>> and enter the texts. plentymarkets will randomly select one of these texts, which will keep your feedback from sounding too repetitious.

[.instruction]
Entering feedback texts for eBay:

. Go to **System » Markets » eBay » Settings**.
. Click on the **Account settings** tab.
. Enter up to four feedback texts in the **Automatic feedback** area.
. **Save** the settings.

[#790]
==== Example 2: Automatically sending payment reminders

Unfortunately, sometimes customers order items on invoice and then forget to pay. In such cases, you should send your customers a reminder email. Use the <<basics/automation/procedure-manager#, procedure manager>> to automate this task.

[.instruction]
Automatically sending the payment reminder template:

. Go to **System » Orders » Procedures**.
. Click on the **New procedure** tab. +
→ A new procedure will be created. **__Note:__** The procedure is not active yet.
. Select the appropriate **Dunning level** in the **Filter** tab, e.g. **level 0**.
. Select the email template **Payment reminder** in the **Procedure** tab.
. Carry out additional settings as desired. Pay attention to the information given in <<table-settings-procedure-manager-email-reminder>>.
. Place a check mark next to the option **Active** in the **Settings** tab.
. **Save** the settings. +
→ The procedure is activated.

[TIP]
.Deactivating the function
====
Remove the check mark next to the option **Active** and save the settings to deactivate the procedure.

|Setting |Explanation

2+|Settings

|**Active**
|Place a check mark to activate the procedure.

|**Execute every day at**
|Specify when the procedure should be carried out.

|**Name**
|Enter a name for the procedure. +
Default entry: The date and time it was created. This will not be displayed to the customer.

2+|Filter

|**Status**
|Select **[3] Waiting for payment**.

|**Last status change**
|Select **Enter the days** and enter a number. For example, 8 means that the last status change was 8 days ago. +
This entry is especially important for reminders or dunning letters. It allows you to ensure that you only include orders that are beyond a due date. +
**Important**: This filter only goes into effect for processes that a status was saved for. It does not go into effect, e.g. when manually booking an incoming payment that no status was saved for.

|**Incoming payment**
|Select **OPEN**. Only considers orders that have not been paid for yet or orders for which no payment has been booked in the system yet.

2+|Procedure

|**Send email template**
|Select **Payment reminder**.

|**Change dunning level**
|The first email should remind the customer to make a payment. The dunning level should be set to **level 1**. This setting allows you to easily recognise orders that have not yet been paid for, but which have already received a first reminder.
|====

If your customer fails to pay despite the payment reminder, then create another email template that is more strongly worded, e.g. a payment request. Create a new procedure for the second dunning level and use it to send the template. Filter all of the unpaid invoices, i.e. orders that are in **status 3**. Select a longer period of time in the **Last status change** field (e.g. 20 days).

Your last option for dealing with unpaid invoices is to hand the orders over to a <<order-processing/payment#, collection agency>>. plentymarkets also offers a simple solution for taking care of this automatically.

[#800]
=== Checklist

Use the following checklist to double check the settings. Work through the checklist once you have carried out all of the previously described settings. This will ensure that your plentymarkets system functions correctly.

❏ Did you understand how statuses work when <<basics/first-steps/quick-start#700, processing orders>>?

❏ Did you edit your <<basics/first-steps/quick-start#710, email templates>> and enter your cancellation rights, bank and contact details?

❏ Did you enter the tracking URL correctly into the **Shipping confirmation of order** template?

❏ Did you use <<basics/first-steps/quick-start#720, event procedures>> and the <<basics/first-steps/quick-start#770, procedure manager>> to automate routine jobs?

Allow enough time for the final check before activating your system. Check whether your plentymarkets system is fully configured and functioning.

[#810]
== Unlocking the online store and deactivating the test mode

Once you have finished configuring your system, you need to <<omni-channel/online-store/setting-up-clients/online-store#lock-store, unlock the online store>> so that customers can access it. You also need to <<crm/sending-emails#100, deactivate the test mode>> so that your customers receive the correct emails.

[.instruction]
Unlocking the online store:

. Go to **System » Client » Select client » Online store » Lock store**.
. Click on **Unlock store now** to reopen the online store after maintenance.

[.instruction]
Deactivating the test mode:

. Go to **System » Client » Select client » Email » Access data**.
. Set the test mode to **Inactive**.

[#820]
== Final check

Several useful notes and suggestions for testing the online store are given below.

[TIP]
.Tip for testing the online store
====
When testing your online store, do not only rely on yourself. The more people you get to test your online store, the more feedback you will get.
====

❏ Is your homepage informative and does it have an appealing design?

❏ Is your website displayed correctly in the most common browsers?

❏ Did you create all mandatory pages? Cancellation rights and shipping costs, legal disclosure and privacy policy, bank details and terms and conditions? Further information can be found in this link:https://www.plentymarkets.co.uk/knowledge/video-archive/basic-settings/quick-start/[video tutorial].

❏ Are your items logically structured within a category tree?

❏ Test the search function and the way that items are displayed individually and in lists.

❏ Put items into the shopping cart and test your shipping configurations. Test various regions and payment methods.

❏ Are the shipping costs calculated correctly for all combinations?

❏ Do the shipping costs that were calculated match the information provided in the category?

❏ Is the individual item shipping charge calculated correctly (if it is used)?

❏ Have all payment methods been set up and activated?

❏ Does the customer receive a complete confirmation after ordering something?

❏ Did you add your data to all of the email templates?

Once you have successfully worked through all of these points, you have completed the quick start and have finished setting up your plentymarkets system.

**Congratulations and good luck!**
