This page of the manual includes a download link of an abriged version of the record of processing activities within plentymarkets in accordance with GDPR whose transition period ends on May 25, 2018.

== What is GDPR?

As of May 25, 2018, the link:http://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-5419-2016-INIT/en/pdf[General Data Protection Regulation^] goes into effect throughout Europe and thus replaces all national regulations.

The GDPR applies to all companies operating in the European Union and processing personal data such as names, bank data and address data. It requires companies to organise and document any processes where personal data is processed in line with the GDPR.

== Important notes

Please note that this record only contains the processing activities within the software plentymarkets. You will need to add the names and descriptions of any other processing activities that take place within your company (e.g. payroll accounting or processes within other software programs).

plentymarkets makes no claim to completeness regarding this record. It is intended to be a supplement when creating your own record of processing activities.

Please note that only *plentymarkets 7* systems are GDPR compliant. The plentymarkets 7 online store plugin *Ceres* will be GDPR compliant after the checkbox for consenting to the data transmission to shipping service providers has been added with the release of *version 2.9.0*.
