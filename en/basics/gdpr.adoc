This page of the manual includes a download link of an abriged version of the record of processing activities within plentymarkets in accordance with GDPR whose transition period ends on May 25, 2018.

== What is GDPR?

As of May 25, 2018, the link:http://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-5419-2016-INIT/en/pdf[General Data Protection Regulation^] goes into effect throughout Europe and thus replaces all national regulations.

The GDPR applies to all companies operating in the European Union and processing personal data such as names, bank data and address data. It requires companies to organise and document any processes where personal data is processed in line with the GDPR.

== Important notes

Please note that this record only contains the processing activities within the software plentymarkets. A list along with a description of the other processing activities that take place in your company (e.g. payroll accounting or processes within other software programs) must be added, of course.

plentymarkets makes no claim to completeness regarding this record. It is intended to be a supplement when creating your own record of processing activities.
