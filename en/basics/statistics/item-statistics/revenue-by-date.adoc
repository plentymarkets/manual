|Entry/Setting |Explanation

|
|Diagram view

|**Type of diagram**
|In this drop-down menu, you can choose how you want the statistics to be displayed. +
**Column and line chart** = Displays the values as columns and lines +
**2D pie chart** = Displays the values as a two-dimensional pie chart +
**3D pie chart** = Displays the values as a three-dimensional pie chart +
**Data table** = An overview of the data in table format

|**Export**
|The data for this diagram is exported in a **CSV file**. The file contains the same parameters as are displayed with the **Data table** diagram.

|**Raw data export**
|The raw data export also generates a **CSV file**. However, the file contains a more detailed set of data. For example, instead of simply indicating the number of sales orders that were generated on a specific day, the CSV file includes relevant data fields for each individual sales order, such as the **sales order ID**, **price** etc.

|
|Settings

|**Name**
|Shows the **name** of the statistic that was entered when the statistic was created. You can change the name here.

|**Time span**
|Each type of statistic has a default setting for **time span** that you can see in table 2 on the **General information** page of the manual. You can choose from a number of predefined time spans in a drop-down menu. In addition for some types of statistics you have the possibility to enter a time span by entering a **start and end date**.

|
|**Change** the **time span** if no or only very few data is shown and then click on the save icon to see the result. Choosing a **larger time span** will give you more information. If there is a lot of data, then a **shorter time span** may make more sense in order to be able to actually interpret the graphic.

|**Starting date ... Ending date**
|You can enter a specific **starting and ending date** here instead of selecting a **time span** (optional).

|**Date based on**
|Select which event should be used for analyzing the data: **Sales order received**, **Incoming payment** or **Outgoing items**.

|**Status options**
|Depending on the type of statistic there are different options available to narrow down the **status**. There are **standard values** set by default.

|
|**All types of sales orders** are included in the statistical analysis except for **cancellations**. This means that **status 8** and **8.1** are excluded from the statistic.

|**Multishop**
|Select the **webshops** or **multishops** that you would like to include into the statistic.

|**Item referrer**
|Here you can select one or more **sales order referrers**. You can also use the option **All** to select all of the available sales order referrers at once.

|**Show amounts**
|Select which **revenue** should be calculated for the statistic: +
**Net revenue** = Revenue minus VAT +
**Gross revenue** = Revenue including VAT +
**Contribution margin II** = Revenue minus taxes, purchase price and the additional costs that were selected

|
|The **contribution margin II** is the remaining amount once all of the **additional costs have been subtracted**, e.g. the transportation or warehouse costs.

|
|**Item bundles** are pass:q[<u>not taken into consideration</u>] for the amounts above. Fees for **markets** are added to the gross price (retail price).

|**Subtract transportation costs**
|Place a check mark if you don't want the **transportation costs** to be taken into consideration for the items.

|
|The costs related to **transportation**, **warehouse**, **operating** and **customs** are only relevant if you saved this information about your items in the **Base** tab.

|
|If you saved information about these costs, then they can be displayed in the statistic and can give you a more detailed **overview** of your profits and losses.

|**Subtract payment commission**
|Place a check mark if you don't want the **payment commission** to be taken into consideration for the items.

|**Subtract producer commission**
|Place a check mark if you don't want the **producer commission** to be taken into consideration for the items.

|**Subtract warehouse costs**
|Place a check mark if you don't want the **warehouse costs** to be taken into consideration for the items.

|**Subtract operating costs**
|Place a check mark if you don't want the **operating costs** to be taken into consideration for the items.

|**Subtract customs**
|Place a check mark if you don't want the **customs** to be taken into consideration for the items.

|
|The **operating** and **customs** costs are saved as **percentages**.
