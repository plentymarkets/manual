| Entry/Setting | Explanation

| Diagram view

|**Type of diagram**
| In this drop-down menu, you can choose how you want the statistics to be displayed. +
**Column line combination chart** = Displays the revenue as columns and the sales orders as lines +
**Data table** = An overview of the data in table format

|**Export**
| The data for this diagram is exported in a **CSV file**. The file contains the same parameters as are displayed with the **Data table** diagram.

For example, instead of simply indicating the number of sales orders that were generated on a specific day, the CSV file includes relevant data fields for each individual sales order, such as the **sales order ID**, **price** etc.
