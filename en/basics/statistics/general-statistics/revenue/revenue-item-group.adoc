== 1) Info: revenues by item groups

This statistic shows the **revenue** that was generated by a particular **group of items** that were purchased during a selected **time span** and that are included in sales orders that fall into a selected **sales order status** range. As an alternative to selecting a certain predefined time span, you can also choose an individual **start** and **end date**. Default setting for the **time span**: the **last 10 days**. Default setting of the **status section**: from **status 1** to **status 7**.

== 2) Details about the statistic

The **number of sales orders** and the corresponding **revenue in Euro** will be displayed for those items that were filtered with the options **marking 1** and **marking 2** and that were generated within the selected **time span**. If this group of items did not generate any revenue on a particular day, then no data will be displayed for this day. The **revenue in Euro** that the group of items generated during a particular **time span** and the **number of sales orders** that correspond to this revenue will be displayed as **information in a mouseover** (see image 1). In this statistic you can see, e.g. how the revenue changed over time for a group of items that have a particular marking.

Explanations of the options

[cols="a,a"]
|====
|Entry/Setting |Explanation

|
|Diagram view

|**Type of diagram**
|In this drop-down menu, you can choose how you want the statistics to be displayed. +
**Column line combination chart** = Displays the revenue as columns and the sales orders as lines +
**Data table** = An overview of the data in table format

|**Export**
|The data for this diagram is exported in a **CSV file**. The file contains the same parameters as are displayed with the **Data table** diagram.

|**Raw data export**
|The raw data export also generates a **CSV file**. However, the file contains a more detailed set of data. For example, instead of simply indicating the number of sales orders that were generated on a specific day, the CSV file includes relevant data fields for each individual sales order, such as the **sales order ID**, **price** etc.

|Settings

|**Name**
|Shows the **name** of the statistic that was entered when the statistic was created. You can change the name here.

|**Time span**
|Each type of statistic has a default setting for **time span** that you can see in table 1 on the <<basics/statistics#, **Statistics**  >> page of the manual. You can choose from a number of predefined time spans in a drop-down menu. In addition for some types of statistics you have the possibility to enter a time span by entering a **start and end date**.

|
|**Change** the **time span** if no or only very few data is shown and then click on the save icon to see the result. Choosing a **larger time span** will give you more information. If there is a lot of data, then a **shorter time span** may make more sense in order to be able to actually interpret the graphic.
