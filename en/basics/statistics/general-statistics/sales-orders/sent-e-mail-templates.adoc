== 1) Info: sent E-mail templates

This statistic shows information about the **E-mails sent** with your system according to the **ID of the E-mail template** as well as to the **name of the template**. The statistical evaluation is made for each date within the selected **time span**. Default setting for the time span: revenue of the **last 30 days**.

== 2) Details about the statistic

The **E-mails that were sent** within the selected **time span** will be displayed. You will see the **E-mail template ID**, the **name of the E-mail template** and **how many times** each E-mail template was sent. If a particular E-mail template was not sent during the selected time period, then no data will be displayed for this template. In this statistic you can see, e.g. which E-mail template was used during the selected time period. This helps you to easily recognize which processes were carried out on a regular basis.

|Entry/Setting |Explanation

|
|Diagram view

|**Type of diagram**
|In this drop-down menu, you can choose how you want the statistics to be displayed. +
**Data table** = An overview of the data in table format

|**Export**
|The data for this diagram is exported in a **CSV file**. The file contains the same parameters as are displayed with the **Data table** diagram.

|**Raw data export**
|The raw data export also generates a **CSV file**. However, the file contains a more detailed set of data. For example, instead of simply indicating the number of orders that were generated on a specific day, the CSV file includes relevant data fields for each individual order, such as the **order ID**, **price** etc.

|
|Settings

|**Name**
|Shows the **name** of the statistic that was entered when the statistic was created. You can change the name here.

|**Time span**
|Each type of statistic has a default setting for **time span** that you can see in table 1 on the <<basics/statistics#, **Statistics**  >> page of the manual. You can choose from a number of predefined time spans in a drop-down menu. In addition for some types of statistics you have the possibility to enter a time span by entering a **start and end date**.

|
|**Change** the **time span** if no or only very few data is shown and then click on the save icon to see the result. Choosing a **larger time span** will give you more information. If there is a lot of data, then a **shorter time span** may make more sense in order to be able to actually interpret the graphic.

|**Starting date ... Ending date**
|You can enter a specific **starting and ending date** here instead of selecting a **time span** (optional).
