|Entry/Setting |Explanation

|
|Diagram view

|**Type of diagram**
|In this drop-down menu, you can choose how you want the statistics to be displayed. +
**Data table** = An overview of the data in table format

|
|**Net** = Amount minus VAT  +
**Contribution margin I** = Revenue minus the purchase price, taxes and shipping costs

|**Export**
|The data for this diagram is exported in a **CSV file**. The file contains the same parameters as are displayed with the **Data table** diagram.

|**Raw data export**
|The raw data export also generates a **CSV file**. However, the file contains a more detailed set of data. For example, instead of simply indicating the number of orders that were generated on a specific day, the CSV file includes relevant data fields for each individual order, such as the **order ID**, **price** etc.

|**Displaying the values**
|Click on the diagram legend in the lower left corner to make a specific set of values **visible** or **invisible** in the diagram. This allows you to display data separately, i.e. to look at some aspects of the data and hide others. This can help you recognize individual values more easily if your data set is very complicated.

|
|Settings

|**Name**
|Shows the **name** of the statistic that was entered when the statistic was created. You can change the name here.

|**Time span**
|Each type of statistic has a default setting for **time span** that you can see in table 1 on the <<basics/statistics#, **Statistics**>> page of the manual. You can choose from a number of predefined time spans in a drop-down menu. In addition for some types of statistics you have the possibility to enter a time span by entering a **start and end date**.

|
|**Change** the **time span** if no or only very few data is shown and then click on the save icon to see the result. Choosing a **larger time span** will give you more information. If there is a lot of data, then a **shorter time span** may make more sense in order to be able to actually interpret the graphic.

|**Starting date ... Ending date**
|You can enter a specific **starting and ending date** here instead of selecting a **time span** (optional).

|**Date based on**
|Select which event should be used for analyzing the data: **Order received**, **Incoming payment** or **Outgoing items**.

|**Status options**
|Depending on the type of statistic there are different options available to narrow down the **status**. There are **standard values** set by default.

|
|**All types of orders** are included in the statistical analysis except for **cancellations**. This means that **status 8** and **8.1** are excluded from the statistic. **Returns** and **credit notes** will only be included if they were specifically selected with the option **Include returns/credit notes**.

|**Producers**
|Select the **producer** that you would like to include into the statistic. Or you can select **all** of the producers. If you select the option **None**, then none of the producers will be included into the statistic.

|**Multishop**
|Select the **webshops** or **multishops** that you would like to include into the statistic.

|**Order referrer**
|Here you can select one or more **order referrers**. You can also use the option **All** to select all of the available order referrers at once.

|
|The **order referrers** correspond to individual **orders** and not to order items.

|**Payment method**
|Select which **payment method** should be included in the statistic or use the option **All** to include all of the payment methods.

|**Shipping profile**
|Select which **shipping profile** should be included in the statistic or use the option **All** to include all of the shipping profiles.

|**Net**
|Activate this option to display **net amounts** in the statistic.

|**Paid orders only**
|Select this option if you only want to include **paid orders** in the statistic.

|**Orders with outgoing items booked only**
|Select this option if you only want to include **orders with outgoing items booked** in the statistic.
