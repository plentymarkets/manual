== 1) Info: reasons of returns

This statistic shows the monetary amounts of **returns** according to the selected **time span** and the **reason for return**. As an alternative to selecting a certain predefined time span, you can also choose an individual **start** and **end date**. Default setting for the **time span**: the **last 10 days**.

== 2) Details about the statistic

The **number of returns** and the corresponding **revenue in Euro** will be displayed for the selected **time span**. Furthermore, the returns are sorted according to the **reason for return**. If a particular reason for return did not occur during the selected time span, then this reason for return will not be displayed. The name of the **reason for return** and the corresponding **amount in Euro** will be displayed as **information in a mouseover** (see image 1). In this statistic you can see, e.g. how many **returns** were made during a particular time period and how much of your **revenue** was affected. Furthermore, you can see how the **number** of returns and the corresponding **amounts** are divided up among the different **reasons for returns**. This can help you monitor your refunds.

Explanations of the options

|Entry/Setting |Explanation

|
|Diagram view

|**Type of diagram**
|In this drop-down menu, you can choose how you want the statistics to be displayed. +
**2D pie chart** = Displays the values as a two-dimensional pie chart +
**3D pie chart** = Displays the values as a three-dimensional pie chart +
**Data table** = An overview of the data in table format

|**Export**
|The data for this diagram is exported in a **CSV file**. The file contains the same parameters as are displayed with the **Data table** diagram.

|**Raw data export**
|The raw data export also generates a **CSV file**. However, the file contains a more detailed set of data. For example, instead of simply indicating the number of orders that were generated on a specific day, the CSV file includes relevant data fields for each individual order, such as the **order ID**, **price** etc.

|Settings

|**Name**
|Shows the **name** of the statistic that was entered when the statistic was created. You can change the name here.

|**Time span**
|Each type of statistic has a default setting for **time span** that you can see in table 1 on the <<basics/statistics#, **Statistics**  >> page of the manual. You can choose from a number of predefined time spans in a drop-down menu. In addition for some types of statistics you have the possibility to enter a time span by entering a **start and end date**.

|
|**Change** the **time span** if no or only very few data is shown and then click on the save icon to see the result. Choosing a **larger time span** will give you more information. If there is a lot of data, then a **shorter time span** may make more sense in order to be able to actually interpret the graphic.

|**Starting date ... Ending date**
|You can enter a specific **starting and ending date** here instead of selecting a **time span** (optional).

|**Status options**
|Depending on the type of statistic there are different options available to narrow down the **status**. There are **standard values** set by default.

|**Multishop**
|Select the **webshops** or **multishops** that you would like to include into the statistic.

|**Order referrer**
|Select one or more **order referrers**. You can also use the option **All** to select all of the available order referrers at once.
