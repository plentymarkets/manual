== General information about sold quantities / returns

This statistic shows you how many copies of your items were __**sold**__ or __**returned**__ during a specific time period. It also shows you the __**relationship**__ between sales and returns displayed as a percentage. You can also see the total __**revenue generated from sales and returns**__. Default settings for the time span: **The last 6 months**.

== Details about the statistic

The __**number of sold items**__, the __**number of returns**__ and corresponding information about the __**revenue in Euro**__ will be displayed for the selected time span. The __**return rate**__ shows you the relationship between how many times an item was sold and how many times it was returned. All of the items will be displayed if you do not select any filters. In other words, you will also see items that were not returned at all.
