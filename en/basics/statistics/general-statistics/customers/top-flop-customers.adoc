==  1) Info: Top / Flop customers

This statistic shows the revenue data sorted according to **top customers** (those are the customers who generated the most revenue during the selected **time span**) and **flop customers** (those are the customers who generated the least revenue). Default setting for the time span: **the last 12 months**.

==  2) Details about the statistic

The number of sales orders and the revenue generated by each customer will be displayed for the selected **time span** and the sort of customer that you choose the statistic to be **based on**. Depending on your selection, you will either see the **top customers** - those are the customers who generated the **most revenue** or the **flop customers** - those are the customers who generated the **least revenue**. The customers will be listed in descending order. In other words, the list of tops will begin with the customer who generated the most **revenue**. This list will end with whichever top customer generated the least revenue. The list of flops is exactly the opposite. In other words, the list begins with whichever customer generated the least revenue and progresses with customers who generated more and more revenue. In this statistic you can see, e.g. which customers generated a very large or a very small amount of revenue. You could use this information, e.g. to set up special deals for individual customers.

Explanations of the options

[cols="a,a"]
|====
| Entry/Setting | Explanation

|
| Diagram view

|**Type of diagram**
| In this drop-down menu, you can choose how you want the statistics to be displayed. +
**Data table** = An overview of the data in table format

|
|**Revenue** = Amounts incl. VAT (gross) +
**Net revenue** = Amounts minus VAT

|**Export**
| The data for this diagram is exported in a **CSV file**. The file contains the same parameters as are displayed with the **Data table** diagram.

|**Raw data export**
| The raw data export also generates a **CSV file**. However, the file contains a more detailed set of data. For example, instead of simply indicating the number of sales orders that were generated on a specific day, the CSV file includes relevant data fields for each individual sales order, such as the **sales order ID**, **revenue** etc.

|
| Settings

|**Name**
| Shows the **name** of the statistic that was entered when the statistic was created. You can change the name here.

|**Time span**
| Each type of statistic has a default setting for **time span** that you can see in table 1 on the <<basics/statistics#, **Statistics**  >> page of the manual. You can choose from a number of predefined time spans in a drop-down menu. In addition, this statistic gives you the possibility to enter a time span by entering a **start and end date**.

|
|**Change** the **time span** if no or only very few data is shown and then click on the save icon to see the result. Choosing a **larger time span** will give you more information. If there is a lot of data, then a **shorter time span** may make more sense in order to be able to actually interpret the graphic.

|**Starting date ... Ending date**
| You can enter a specific **starting and ending date** here instead of selecting a **time span** (optional).

|**Multishop**
| Select the **webshops** or **multishops** that you would like to include into the statistic.

|**Sales order referrer**
| Here you can select one or more **sales order referrers**. You can also use the option **All** to select all of the available sales order referrers at once.

|
| The **sales order referrers** correspond to individual **sales orders** and not to sales order items.

|**Include customers without any orders**
| Place a check mark if you want the data table to include customers who did not place any orders during the selected time period.

|**Based on**
| Select whether you want to see the statistics for **Tops** or **Flops**.
