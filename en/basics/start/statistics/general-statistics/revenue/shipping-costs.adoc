== 2) Details about the statistic

The **shipping costs** and the **date when orders were shipped** is displayed for the selected **time span**. If no sales orders are available for a particular date, then no column will be displayed. The **shipping costs per shipping service provider** and the **percentage of total costs** that each shipping service provider was responsible for will be displayed as **mouseover information** for a particular **date** (see image 1). In this statistic you can see, e.g. how much of the shipping costs each shipping service provider was responsible for.

Explanations of the options

|Entry/Setting |Explanation

|
|Diagram view

|**Type of diagram**
|In this drop-down menu, you can choose how you want the statistics to be displayed. +
**Stacked column chart** = Displays the values as columns. Each shipping service provider is designated by a different color. The shipping costs that relate to these providers are stacked one on top of the other. +
**Data table** = An overview of the data in table format

|**Export**
|The data for this diagram is exported in a **CSV file**. The file contains the same parameters as are displayed with the **Data table** diagram.

|**Raw data export**
|The raw data export also generates a **CSV file**. However, the file contains a more detailed set of data. For example, instead of simply indicating the number of sales orders that were generated on a specific day, the CSV file includes relevant data fields for each individual sales order, such as the **sales order ID**, **price** etc.

|
|Settings

|**Name**
|Shows the **name** of the statistic that was entered when the statistic was created. You can change the name here.

|**Time span**
|Each type of statistic has a default setting for **time span** that you can see in table 1 on the <<basics/start/statistics#, **Statistics**  >> page of the manual. You can choose from a number of predefined time spans in a drop-down menu. In addition for some types of statistics you have the possibility to enter a time span by entering a **start and end date**.

|
|**Change** the **time span** if no or only very few data is shown and then click on the save icon to see the result. Choosing a **larger time span** will give you more information. If there is a lot of data, then a **shorter time span** may make more sense in order to be able to actually interpret the graphic.

|**Starting date ... Ending date**
|You can enter a specific **starting and ending date** here instead of selecting a **time span** (optional).

|**Status options**
|Depending on the type of statistic there are different options available to narrow down the **status**. There are **standard values** set by default.

|**Multishop**
|Select the **webshops** or **multishops** that you would like to include into the statistic.

|**Sales order referrer**
|Here you can select one or more **sales order referrers**. You can also use the option **All** to select all of the available sales order referrers at once.

|**Shipping region**
|Here you can select a **shipping region**. You can also use the option **All** to select all of the available shipping regions at once.

|**Shipping cost source**
|Select whether the **main order** or a **delivery order** should be used as the **source for the corresponding shipping costs**.
