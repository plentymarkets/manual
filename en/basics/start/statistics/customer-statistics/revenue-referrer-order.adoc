==  Info: revenue by order referrer

This statistic shows how much **revenue** was generated by each sales order **referrer**. Furthermore, it shows which **percentage** of the total revenue each referrer generated. The data relates to one specific customer. As an alternative to selecting a certain predefined time span, you can also choose an individual **start** and **end date**. Default setting for the **time span**: the **last 30 days**. Default setting of the **status section**: From **status 1** to **status 7**.

==  Details about the statistic

The **revenue in Euro** that was generated by the customer will be displayed for each **sales order referrer** within the selected **time span**. If a sales order referrer did not generate any revenue, then this referrer will not be displayed. The **sales order referrer**, the corresponding **revenue in Euro** and the **percentage of total revenue** will be displayed as **information in a mouseover** (see image 1). In this statistic you can see, e.g. how much revenue the customer generated with each referrer.

You can choose from a number of predefined time spans in a drop-down menu.
