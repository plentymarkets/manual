Welcome to the topic **Working with plentymarkets**

In this area you will learn how to manage user accounts. Without a user, you will not be able to work with plentymarkets. You will also find information about general functions that facilitate your work in the plentymarkets system. Examples, such as setting up shortcuts and other time-savers are described under general functions. Furthermore, we provide you with a quick start. In the quick start, we illustrate all features necessary for setting up your first functional online store.
