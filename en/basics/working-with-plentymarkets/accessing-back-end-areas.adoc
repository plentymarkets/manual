:description: This manual page provides you with information how to access specific back end areas by using URLs.
:position: 20

Due to the abolition of the old Classic back end, we created the possibility of directly accessing specific areas of the back end by using UI actions. Thus, you save time and it’s not necessary anymore to click through the whole back end. This page lists the variables and parameters that lead to the respective back end areas. Pay attention to the information given in the box below and follow the example.

[IMPORTANT]
*_Note:_* For technical reasons, *ui_action* has been replaced by *uiAction* in Terra. Moreover, it is relevant whether it is a system on https://plentymarkets-cloud-de.com or https://plentymarkets-cloud-ie.com. For the parameter keys, it is also necessary to pay attention to lower-case and upper-case letters. +
If you were already logged in and want to be directly forwarded to the system, it is sufficient to enter the plenty ID into the URL. +
*_Example_*: To open the variation detail view, the path has to consist of the following parameters: +
plentymarkets-cloud-de.com/1234?uiAction=ITEM_VARIATION_DETAIL&itemId=102&variationId=1111

== Accessing a back end area with a URL:

. Start the path with the web address on which your system is located and add a */* at the end.
. Enter your plenty ID.
. Continue with the query string. It begins with a *?*.
. Add *uiAction=*.
. Add the key for the UI actions and the parameter with the corresponding ID. Pay attention to the information given in <<table-keys-ui-actions-parameters>> and orient yourself on the example mentioned above. +
→ As soon as the path includes all relevant information, you can access the desired back end area.
