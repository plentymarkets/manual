:description: This manual page provides you with information how to access specific back end areas by using URLs.
:position: 90

Due to the abolition of the old Classic back end, we created the possibility of directly accessing specific areas of the back end by using UI actions. Thus, you save time and it’s not necessary anymore to click through the whole back end. This page lists the variables and parameters that lead to the respective back end areas. Pay attention to the information given in the box below and follow the example.

[IMPORTANT]
*_Note:_* For technical reasons, *ui_action* has been replaced by *uiAction* in Terra. Moreover, it is relevant whether it is a system on https://plentymarkets-cloud-de.com or https://plentymarkets-cloud-ie.com. For the parameter keys, it is also necessary to pay attention to lower-case and upper-case letters. +
If you were already logged in and want to be directly forwarded to the system, it is sufficient to enter the plenty ID into the URL. +
*_Example_*: To open the variation detail view, the path has to consist of the following parameters: +
plentymarkets-cloud-de.com/1234?uiAction=ITEM_VARIATION_DETAIL&itemId=102&variationId=1111

The following table lists the different keys that allow you to access specific back end areas.
