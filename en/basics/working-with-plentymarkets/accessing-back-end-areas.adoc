You must be logged in to open a back end area with a URL. Also pay attention to lower-case and upper-case letters in paramenter keys.

== Safe mode

Using safe mode, you can access the back end with all plugins deactivated. This may be necessary if you receive an error when logging in after installing or updating a plugin. In safe mode, you can change the status of the plugin to *inactive*.

If you want to log in using safe mode, use https://plentymarkets-cloud-de.com/?safemode=1.
