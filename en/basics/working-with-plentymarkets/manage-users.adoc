:description: Working with plentymarkets: Manage user accounts, create new users and edit existing user accounts in the plentymarkets system.
:position: 10

Create accounts for new users and edit existing user accounts in the user menu. Furthermore, assign roles and classes to users. Depending on the workflow, they are important for other areas in the system. Roles are used for grouping users and assigning the same rights to multiple user accounts in a very convenient way. Classes on the other hand allow you to assign rights to specific users and interfaces. For example, assign API calls to users of the API class individually.

Five free user accounts are included in every plentymarkets system. If you need additional user accounts, book them in the link:https://www.plentymarkets.co.uk/prices/[configurator].

The following video tutorial introduces you to the **User** menu:

[#10]
== Creating users

When using your plentymarkets system for the first time, a default user of the **Admin** class with administrative rights is already set up in the system. At least one admin user account is required. Therefore, create a new user of the **Admin** class and delete the default user afterwards or edit the existing user account. Proceed as described below to create new user of any class.

[.instruction]
Creating a new user:

. Go to **System » Settings » User » Accounts**.
. Click on **New**. +
→ The **Create new user** window will open.
. Enter the **User name**, **Actual name** and **Password**.
. Repeat the password.
. Enter the user's email address. This will allow the user to receive messages from the system.
. Select a **User class**. Pay attention to the information given in table 1.
. **Save** the settings.

The user name must not contain any spaces and must have at least 5 characters.

Click on **My account** to open your own user account.

The user classes are preset and the classes' settings cannot be changed. The following table includes detailed information about preset rights and rights that you can assign individually:

Define which menus in plentymarkets are visible to the user and what he or she may edit. You can assign rights to every user individually or to multiple users via roles. This chapter explains how to use rights correctly. In the following, you will learn how to create roles. The rights menus for users and roles have the same structure. Go to the **Right** tab in a user's account. The tab is composed of several tabs for determining the individual rights. Depending on the user's class, different tabs with different rights may be visible. The Variable class offers the most extensive range of rights settings for users.

[#100]
=== Defining visibility

In the **Visibility** tab, you define which functions and options are visible to users when opening a menu. Without visibility rights, a warehouse or orders of a certain status, for example, are invisible to the user.

|**Selectable order status**
|Select which order statuses the user should be allowed to apply.

|**Clients (stores)**
|Select one, several or all clients (stores) visible to the user. Users will have access rights to the selected areas only. If no client is selected, then specific rights such as the right to access certain **menus** will not go into effect. This is because the user will not have access to any of the clients. +
**All** = The user has access to all of the clients. +
**Default** = The user has access to the default store.

|**Ticket status**
|Select ticket statuses. Users will be able to view and edit tickets that are in these statuses.  +
**Invisible** = The user will not see tickets with this status. +
**Visible** = The user will see all tickets that are in this status. +
**Own only** = The user will only see tickets that are in this status and that he or she owns. +
All tickets are listed in the ticket overview, i.e. also those tickets that are not visible to the user. However, the user is unable to open invisible tickets.

[#80]
== Editing roles

After creating a role, it will open in a new tab for editing. The role is also added to the role overview so that you can open and edit it later. Roles are listed alphabetically in the overview. Every role is divided into 3 tabs. In the **Settings** tab, you can change the role's name. In the **User** tab, you link users to this role. In the **Rights** tab, you assign rights to the role. The same settings used for users of the Variable class are also available for roles. For further information about rights, refer to the <<basics/working-with-plentymarkets/manage-users#90, Assigning rights>> chapter.

Users of the Admin and Variable classes can create roles. Users of the Variable class must have the corresponding rights to do so.

[.instruction]
Linking users to roles:

. Go to **System » Settings » User » Roles**.
. Open a role.
. Click on the **User** tab.
. Select users from the **Available users** column.
. Click on the **single arrow pointed to the right** to transfer the selected users to the **Assigned users** column.
. Alternative: Drag and drop a user to the **Assigned users** column.
. **Save** the settings.

[TIP]
.Assigning multiple users at the same time
====
Press and hold **Ctrl** or **cmd**, then select multiple users by left clicking on them to assign them at the same time. The lower arrow buttons will transfer all users.
====

The role is assigned to the users in the **Assigned users** column. The **roles** in the **Master data** tab of a user's account automatically match the settings made here. Assigned roles can be changed in both places of the system.

[.instruction]
Linking roles to users:

. Go to **System » Settings » User » Accounts**.
. Open a user account.
. Select one, several or all of the roles in the **Roles** setting.
. **Save** the settings.

[TIP]
.Linking user roles to users of the Admin class
====
Administrators have all rights. However, it is important that roles are assigned to administrators for some processes. For example, administrators only receive role-specific emails when linked to the corresponding role.
====

[.subhead]
Example of use

The administrator of the company MyStore creates multiple roles. All the rights to be assigned to every user are included in the Employee role. With this role, it is no longer necessary to assign these rights to every single user. Also, changes to rights concerning all users can be made in the Employee role. In addition to this role, the administrator creates the Warehouse technician and Accounting roles - specific roles for a small group of users only.

.example for roles
[cols="a,a,a"]
|====
|Role |Rights: Visibility |Rights: Menu

|**Employee**
|Clients (stores) » Standard
|Start » Webmail +
Start » Forum

|**Warehouse technician**
|Warehouse
|Settings » Stock » Warehouse +
Stock +
Orders » Fulfilment

|**Accounting**
|
|Start » Vacation +
System » Client » Select client » Locations » Select location » Accounting
|====

Mr. Doe is a logistics specialist at MyStore and receives the Employee and Warehouse technician roles. If a user has several roles, the user's rights are added up. Therefore, Mr. Doe receives the rights **Clients (stores)**, **Webmail** and **Forum** from the Employee role as well as the rights **Warehouse**, **Stock** and **Fulfilment** from the Warehouse technician role. However, he doesn't have the **Vacation** and **Accounting** rights because the Accounting role wasn't assigned to his user account.
