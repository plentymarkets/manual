The backup function of the menu **System » Settings » Data » Backup** allows you to reset data to a previous state or to restore deleted data.

[IMPORTANT]
.Limitations
====
You can only use the backup function within the same version of plentymarkets. This means that it is not possible to import a backup of an older version of plentymarkets.
====

== Backing up and restoring data

The menu **System » Settings » Data » Backup** offers an overview of the existing backups with the corresponding dates. They are automatically created on a daily basis.

== Storing a backup locally

As an additional safeguard, you can save backup files locally. To do so, proceed as follows.

[.instruction]
Storing a backup locally:

. Go to **System » Settings » Data » Backup**.
. Select the backup you want to download.
. Click on *Download backup*. +
→ The backup is downloaded in compressed form.

[TIP]
.Waiting for backup
====
The download of large files will take some time. Once the process is complete, the download button is activated.
====

== Importing a backup

You can reset your system to the status of any backup.

[WARNING]
.Possible data loss
====
Note that importing a backup can overwrite current data. Data that have changed since the last backup creation can be lost irreversibly.
