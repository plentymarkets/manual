The plentymarkets calendar is a fully integrated calendar module. It is located in the **Start » Calendar** menu of your plentymarkets system. The calendar allows you to make appointments and plan deadlines. This helps you organize your own and your employees' time and improve internal processes.

== Structure of the calendar

The calendar displays your appointments. In addition, it shows the appointments of any users whose calenders have been made visible to you and which you have activated in the **filter**.

You can choose to display the **Day**, **Week** or **Month**. In the top left corner of the calendar, the button **Today** is displayed. You can switch back to displaying the current day by clicking this button at any time.

The filter shows a list of all users for which you at least have read permissions. Place a check mark to display a user's appointments in your calendar.
