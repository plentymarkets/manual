==  General information about tasks

Use the **Tasks** menu to manage specific duties for all of the users in the system. For example, a task could be "correcting invoice 123" or "contacting the customer, Mr. Doe". You can see how much progress has been made towards completing a task. This helps you plan your business processes and improve internal processes. It is possible to create tasks in this menu and within tickets. For example, this allows you to directly create concrete tasks that relate to customer queries.

==  Configuration

Click on a task in the overview to configure the task further (image 1). The options are described in table 1. The **ID** is automatically assigned and can not be changed. If a **ticket ID** was saved, then you can click on the link to access the ticket directly.

[IMPORTANT]
.Tasks and tickets
====
If you want to assign tasks to a ticket, then the task must be saved in the **ticket**. Every ticket has a **Tasks** tab. **New tasks** can be saved in this tab. Tasks that were saved in the ticket will also be displayed here in the overview of tasks.

===  Creating and editing tasks
