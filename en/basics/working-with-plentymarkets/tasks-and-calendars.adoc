On this page of the manual, you learn how to manage <<basics/working-with-plentymarkets/tasks-and-calendars#100, tasks>> and <<basics/working-with-plentymarkets/tasks-and-calendars#600, calendars>>.

== Managing tasks

Use the *plentymarkets Logo (Start) » Tasks* menu to manage duties for all of the users in the system. For example, a task could be ""Call customer xy". You can see how much progress has been made towards completing a task. This helps you plan your business processes and improve internal processes.

You can create tasks in the *plentymarkets Logo (Start) » Tasks* menu and in the <<crm/using-the-ticket-system#4000, ticket system>>. This allows you to directly create a task during a customer phone call, for example. If a task is created in the *CRM » Ticket system » Open ticket » Tab: Tasks*, it is linked to the ticket. This link is also visible in the overview of tasks under *plentymarkets Logo (Start) » Tasks*.
