== Accessing the Service center

Proceed as described below to access your system's settings.

[.instruction]
Accessing information about the plentymarkets system:

. Go to **Start » plentymarkets account » Service center**.
. Click on the blue **plus icon** of the desired system. +
→ The available tabs will be displayed.

The available tabs are described below.

== Version upgrade


plentymarkets is continuously being developed and optimized. Usually, a new beta and stable version are released each week and your system is automatically updated. We publish a changelog for every new version so that you can always keep track of the changes. The changelogs can be found in the plentymarkets Forum. This also includes important notes about the new version, e.g. ToDos. In some cases, adjustments may have to be carried out manually or settings may have to be checked and tested after upgrading from one version to another. Your current version of plentymarkets is displayed at the top left in your plentymarkets backend.

[#contract]
== Contract

The menu **Start » plentymarkets account » Service center » Tab: Contract** provides you with information about your current plentymarkets contract. Here you can make changes to your contract or you may cancel your contract.

== Changing the contract

plentymarkets grows along with your needs. Decide for yourself how many orders you want to process with plentymarkets each month. We will provide you with the necessary system performance. The **Contract** tab allows you to make changes in your plentymarkets contract on your own once it is up and running. It makes sense to make changes, e.g. if you generate more orders than are included in your current rate. It is possible to book a higher rate at any time. If you book a lower rate, then it will go into effect once the regular duration of your current contract has ended.

[.instruction]
Changing the contract:

. Go to **Start » plentymarkets account » Service center**.
. Click on the **Contract** tab.
. Click on **System configurator**.
. Make changes to the contract information as desired.

== Canceling a contract

The **Contract** tab in the service center also contains an option for canceling your contract with plentymarkets. Click on **Cancel contract** to request that your contract be canceled.

[#domain]
== Domain

Go to **Start » plentymarkets account » Service center » Tab: Domain** to access functions for managing domains. You can see the parameters for your domains here and change some of them. You can also order a new domain here or relocate an existing domain. Furthermore, you can link an existing external domain or create a subdomain for a main domain.

=== Information about domains

The following table includes explanations of the various domain types:

[cols="a,a,a,a,a"]
|====
|Type |Additional information |Example name |TLD |Explanation

|Domain
|---
|yourstore
|.com
|The word "domain" refers to an Internet address in the form of a name and an extension, i.e. the top level domain. The name can be chosen freely. A domain is unique, i.e. the exact same domain may never be used twice. Therefore, when registering a desired domain, e.g. with a hosting service provider, it is necessary to check whether the domain has already been used.

|Subdomain
|info.
|yourstore
|.com
|It is possible to create as many subdomains as desired for a domain. Subdomains do not need to be registered. Subdomains use variations of the domain name. They are either placed in front of or behind the domain name and they are separated from it with a period.

|Additional domains
|---
|your-store  +
your_store
|.com
|You can create additional domains that have slightly different names than the main domain. They forward to the main domain so that it can be found, e.g. even if an alternate spelling was used. The additional domain **your-store.com** could be useful for the example above. This would allow the main domain **yourstore.com** to be accessed even if a hyphen was used in the spelling. The names and top level domains can be chosen freely for additional domains. Every additional domain receives the main domain's IP address.
|====

__Table 1: examples of domains__

=== New domains in plentymarkets

This chapter teaches you how to order new domains, how to create new external domains or subdomains and how to delete a subdomain.

[WARNING]
.Availability after the initial setup or changes
====
It can take up to 24 hours until all of the settings are available on all systems. If settings were changed after 4 p.m., then they will not be processed until after 4 p.m. the following day. If settings were changed on the weekend, then they will not be processed until after 4 p.m. the following Monday. It can take up to 12 hours to process these changes.
====

==== Ordering a new domain

Proceed as described below to order a new domain.

[.instruction]
Ordering a new domain:

. Go to **Start » plentymarkets account » Service center » Tab: Domain**.
. Click on **Order a new domain**.
. Enter the desired domain name.
. Select the top level domain (TLD) from the drop-down menu, e.g. **co.uk** or **com**.
. Click on **Check**.  +
→ The system will check whether the domain is available.

You will receive information about how much it costs to use the domain per month. Enter the contact details (domain handle) and assign the corresponding plentymarkets system. Then order the domain by clicking on **Place order**.

[IMPORTANT]
.Registering .com domains
====
You will receive an email when registering a .com domain. This email will ask you to confirm the WHOIS data that was entered. This email is sent to the email address that was entered under ADMIN-C in the handle data (WHOIS). If you did not receive an email, check whether this email address is available and working.
====

==== Relocating a domain

If the domain is already available, then you can relocate it. To do so, proceed as described in the chapter **Ordering a new domain**. Follow the instructions in the menu.

[.instruction]
Important information about relocating a domain:

* Please have your previous provider's authentication code ready as you will need to enter it.
* The processing times may vary depending on the Top Level Domain.
* **.de** domains: up to 24 hours
* **.com** and **.net** domains: 3 to 7 days
* **.eu** domains: up to 5 days

* You will receive an email if you relocate a **.com** or **.net** domain. The email will ask you to confirm the relocation. This email is sent to the email address that was entered under ADMIN-C in the handle data (WHOIS). If you did not receive an email, check whether this email address is available and working. If the email address no longer exists, then ask your current domain provider to change the email address.

==== Creating a new external domain

Use the option **Create a new external domain** to link an existing external domain to the desired plentymarkets system. The domain's IP address will then be displayed in the overview of domains. Save the DNS data in the DNS zone of the hosting service provider. If there is an IPv6 A-Record in your externally managed domain, then remove it.

==== Creating a new subdomain

You can create as many subdomains as you want for a domain. You do not need to register these subdomains. For example, if you have the domain **yourstore.com**, then you could create the subdomain **info.yourstore.com** to provide special information about your online store with this domain. Use the drop-down menu to select which main domain you want to link with the subdomain. Select the corresponding plentymarkets system as well.

[IMPORTANT]
.Availability and updates
====
It can take up to 24 hours for new domains or changes to become available. This is because the servers need to be restarted periodically and the data is not distributed in the cloud immediately.
====

==== Deleting a subdomain

You can delete a subdomain. To do so, proceed as follows.

[.instruction]
Deleting a subdomain:

. Go to **Start » plentymarkets account » Service center » Tab: Domain**.

→ The end of the contract is displayed in a new window.

[WARNING]
.Canceling the main domain
====
Only cancel your main domain if you also want to cancel your plentymarkets system's contract. Otherwise you will have to save a new main domain.  +
If you want to cancel your system's contract, also pay attention to our cancellation deadlines. If you cancel your main domain too early, the domain's contract might well end earlier than the system's contract. The system will no longer be available in this case, even though the contract has not ended yet.
====

[WARNING]
.Canceling a client (store)
====
If you cancel a client (store), the domains associated with this client are also canceled. To continue using these domains, link them to a different client.
====

==== Current DNS settings

In this area of the Service Center, you can view the DNS settings of your domain. DNS is short for Domain Name System. DNS makes it possible for your customers to enter the domain name instead of the numerical IP address of your online store.

===== Updating DNS settings for external domain providers

**MX** stands for Mail Exchange Resource Record. <<basics/working-with-plentymarkets/plentymarkets-account#domain-mailserver, **Mail server**>> parameters that are available for receiving and sending emails.

[#domain-nameserver]
==== Name server

Displays the currently used Domain Name Server (DNS).

[#domain-mailserver]
==== Mail server

The mail servers that are available for receiving and sending emails. You do not need to carry out any additional settings if you use the plentymarkets mail server. If you use your own server, then save the values for the IP address as well as MX10 through MX40 if available. The server MX10 takes priority over MX20. In other words, emails are first sent to mail server MX10. If it is not available, then they will be sent to mail server MX20. The lower the MX number, the higher its priority. You should save at least two mail servers to ensure that the availability is never compromised. For example, if a server is down or needs to be maintained, then it will still be possible to receive emails with the other one.

The mailbox.org mail server is selected by default when you order a new domain. The plentymarkets mail server is not available for external domains or domains with external system links.

[.instruction]
Saving the mail server:

. Go to **Start » plentymarkets account » Service center » Tab: Domain**.
. Click on the **blue plus** icon next to the domain that you want to save a mail server for.
. Select the option **plentymarkets mail server** or **Own mail server** from the **Mail server** drop-down menu.
. If you use your own mail server, then pay attention to the explanations given in table 2.
. Click on **Save mail server** to save the settings.

==== Linking a system

Here you can link the domain to a plentymarkets system or you can edit an existing system link. If you set up multiple domains, then you can select which one should be used as the main domain for each plentymarkets client. The URL will then be displayed in the browser's address line. This is even true for the other domains. It may take up to 24 hours until all of the settings or changes are available on all systems.

[WARNING]
.Switching the main domain
====
If you switch the main domain, then change the URL accordingly on all platforms and in the interface settings in your plentymarkets system, e.g. in the settings for payment providers.  +
Furthermore, go to <<order-processing/payment/managing-bank-details#70, **Settings » Orders » Payment » EBICS**>> and save the data there once again, in order to update the basic settings.
====

[WARNING]
.Linking a external system
====
The plentymarkets system cannot be linked to an external server if the domain is a main domain. In this case, save a different domain as the main domain before proceeding.
====

[.instruction]
Linking a plentymarkets system:

. Select the plentymarkets system that you want to link the domain to.
. If you use your own server, then select the setting **external server**.
. Enter the server's IP address (A-Record).
. Click on the **Save system link** button.

[#auth-code]
==== Domain auth code

You need to have an authentication code for your domain if you switch to a different <<basics/working-with-plentymarkets/plentymarkets-account#domain, **provider**>>. This auth code proves that you own the domain. You can generate the auth code in this area.

[.instruction]
Generating the domain auth code:

. Click on **Generate domain auth code** in order to generate the authentication code.  +
→ The code will be generated and displayed in the **Domain auth code** line.

[IMPORTANT]
.Validity of the domain auth code
====
A domain auth code is valid for 30 days. If you do not use the code during this time, then you will have to generate a new code after the 30 days.
====

==== CNAME Resource Record

A Canonical Name or CNAME record is a type of DNS record that links an alias name to another canonical domain name (Source: http://support.google.com/a/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=112037). For example, you can use it along with the provider **Shopgate** to create a mobile version of your online store or you can use it to set up an external email service. In the example, the source __**mobile.your-shop.com**__ is the mobile version of the domain __**your-shop.com**__. Use the Shopgate subdomain __**cname.shopgate.com**__ as the target (image 1). This CNAME entry ensures that your store will have the correct resolution with Shopgate.

image::basics/working-with-plentymarkets/assets/EN-Service-Center-Domain-01.png[]

__Image 1: entering the CNAME__

==== TXT Record

Use the TXT Resource Record to save a user-definable text within a DNS zone. This can be done for your main domain as well as for all sub-domains of your online store. For example, email or newsletter service providers may require such entries. You will receive the texts to be entered here directly from your service provider.

[#200]
==== Saving name servers for sub-domains

In the **Name server for sub-domains** area, enter one or more name servers for a sub-domain.

* Name servers can be saved for sub-domains of a main domain only.
* Enter more than one name server separated by commas.
* Enter the name server's domain name.

Save a name server for sub-domains e.g. to send Newsletter2Go newsletters from an link:https://www.newsletter2go.co.uk/features/newsletter-dispatch-dedicated-ips/[**exclusive, dedicated IP address**^] to optimise delivery rates. If you have booked this Newsletter2Go service, enter the Newsletter2Go name server as the target server. You will receive the necessary information regarding sub-domains and name server from Newsletter2Go.

Proceed as described below to save a name server for a sub-domain.

[.instruction]
Saving name servers for sub-domains:

. Go to **Start » plentymarkets account » Service center » Tab: Domain**.
. Click on the **blue plus** icon of the main domain.
. In the **Name server for sub-domains** area, enter the sub-domain in the **Sub-domain** field.
. Enter the domain name of the target server in the **Target** field. Separate several domain names by commas.
. **Save** the settings.

==== Domain transfer

If you want to switch to a different webhosting provider, then you will need to carry out a domain name transfer (also known as a KK or auth info procedure in Germany). You need to fill out a standardized form of authorization in order for the domain to be transferred. The German form is called a connectivity coordination application, abbreviated as a KK-Antrag. The connectivity coordination application regulates the switch from one provider to another. The auth info procedure is becoming more and more popular.

Please note the following points when switching to a different web hosting provider:

* Generate an <<basics/working-with-plentymarkets/plentymarkets-account#auth-code, **auth code**>>.
* Do not delete your previous domain name with your current provider.
* Tell your current provider about your plans to transfer the domain and let them know that they will soon receive an authorization form.
* Contact the new provider in regards to the transfer. Your new provider will ask you to sign a form and confirm that you want to transfer the domain.

It is usually possible to transfer the domain without any problems. The process can be completed in a short amount of time. However, if you have any problems with the domain transfer because of incomplete or unclear data, then your old provider may initially reject the transfer. In such a case, contact the old provider as soon as possible. The current provider can only accept the transfer once there are no further uncertainties.

[TIP]
.IPS tag
====
If you want to transfer your **.uk** or **co.uk** domain to us from a different domain provider, you need to have your current domain provider adapt the IPS tag in advance. The IPS tag of our domain provider is:

**UNITEDDOMAINS-DE**
====

==== URL forwarding

The **URL forwarding** area allows you to set up forwarding for an extra charge. Proceed as described below to set up forwarding.

[.instruction]
Setting up URL forwarding:

. Go to **Start » plentymarkets account » Service center » Tab: Domain**.
. Click on the **blue plus** icon next to the domain that you want to forward from.
. Click on the **URL forwarding instructions**.
. Read the information that is displayed.
. Pay attention to the instructions and enter the forwarding information into the designated field.
. Click on **Save URL forwarding**.

[#ssl-certificate]
== SSL certificate
**plentymarkets » Start » plentymarkets account » Service center » Tab: Domain**

=== Content of this page

This page provides information about SSL certificates. You will find out how to check for the expiration date of your SSL certificate and how to order a new SSL certificate or deactivate your active SSL certificate if necessary.

=== Information about SSL certificates

An __**SSL certificate**__ is used to __**encode**__ your website. It also provides a __**secure connection**__ to your website and online store. An SSL certificate is required for certain __**markets**__ and for receiving the __**Trusted Shops**__ certification. Your customers can easily see when you are using an SSL certificate as your website will then be accessed via __**https**__.

An SSL certificate is valid for **__at least one year__**. It is **__not renewed automatically__**. Therefore, you need to access the **plentymarkets Service Center** and order a new SSL certificate before your old certificate expires. You always order a new certificate. This means that even if you already own an SSL certificate that is about to expire, you still select a certificate provider and duration from scratch. plentymarkets will place the order on your behalf with the certificate provider you choose and will bill you for the purchase price. There will be no monthly fee for using SSL.

You order the SSL certificate for your **<<basics/working-with-plentymarkets#domain, main domain>>**, i.e. the one that you set as the main domain in the **<<basics/working-with-plentymarkets#domain, Start » plentymarkets account » Service Center » Tab: Domain>>** menu. If you want to use an SSL certificate for a different domain, you will have to set this domain as your main domain first.

[IMPORTANT]
.No SSL certificates for canceled domains or test domains
====
You cannot order SSL certificates for canceled domains or for start-up / test domains, i.e. domains with names that contain **plenty-testdrive.eu**, **plentymarkets-x1.com** etc. For this reason, the **Order SSL certificate** button is not displayed for these types of domains.
====

=== Expiration date of your SSL certificate

You can check the expiration date of your SSL certificate and order a new SSL certificate in the <<basics/working-with-plentymarkets#domain, **Domain**>> tab of your plentymarkets Service center.
// Vor Ablauf Ihres SSL-Zertifikats erhalten Sie außerdem eine E-Mail von plentymarkets, die Sie über das bevorstehende Ablaufdatum informiert.

A new certificate becomes valid immediately or, if the certificate provider carries out some quality controls, within about 24 hours. You cannot select a later starting date for the certificate's validity. This means that the certificate becomes valid as soon as the certificate provider confirms your order.

=== Ordering a new SSL certificate

Before you order, check that the E-mail address **__hostmaster@yourDomain__** is set up in your system and that E-mails to this address are not forwarded to the plentymarkets support. Then proceed as described below to order a new SSL certificate.

[IMPORTANT]
.Setting up the E-mail address hostmaster@yourDomain
====
Before ordering, set up the <<crm/sending-emails#, **E-mail address**>>__**hostmaster@yourDomain**__. During the order process, you will receive one E-mail from plentymarkets and another from the SSL certificate provider at this address. +
If this E-mail address is already set up in your system, you need to check that E-mails sent to it are not <<crm/sending-emails#, **forwarded**>> to the E-mail address __**support@plentymarkets.com**__. Deactivate any forwarding to make sure that you receive the E-mails yourself.
====

[.instruction]
Ordering a new SSL certificate:

. Go to **Start » plentymarkets account » Service center » Tab: Domain**.
. Click on the **blue plus icon** to open your __**main domain**__.
. Click on **Order SSL certificate**. +
→ If your current SSL certificate is valid for at least another 21 days, you will be prompted to confirm that you want to proceed with your order. Confirm your selection if you want to order a new certificate ahead of time.
. Click on **Continue order** in the window **Confirm SSL certificate**.

[NOTE]
.Do not log out of the Service center
====
Do not log out of the plentymarkets Service center during the order process. Stay logged in until you have completed the order process and received and confirmed both E-mails.
====

plentymarkets will now send an **__E-mail__** to your E-mail address __**hostmaster@yourDomain**__. Read the information it contains and then click on the link **Confirm SSL order**. If your current SSL certificate is valid for at least another 21 days, you will again be prompted to confirm that you want to proceed with your order. Confirm your selection if you want to order a new certificate ahead of time.

The available SSL certification bodies and durations are now displayed. Decide which certificate you want to order and then proceed as described below.

[.instruction]
Selecting the SSL certificate provider and duration:

. Click on the **Order now** button for the SSL certificate you want to buy. +
→ The certificate provider sends an E-mail to your E-mail address __**hostmaster@yourDomain**__.
. Read the information in this E-mail and then click on the link it contains. You will be directed to the confirmation page of the certificate provider.
. Check the information displayed on this page and then confirm your order by clicking on the relevant button. +
→ Your order is complete. If the certificate provider does not carry out any quality controls (see note below), then the validity details of your new SSL certificate are displayed in the **Domain** tab of the Service center after about 10 minutes.

[IMPORTANT]
.Quality control measures by the certificate provider
====
In some cases, the certificate provider will carry out some quality controls before it activates the SSL certificate. Therefore, you should always read the confirmation message displayed on the screen closely. These quality controls usually take up to 24 hours. If the status has not changed to "Done" after 24 hours in the plentymarkets Service center, create a new topic in the plentymarkets forum and include your domain details.
====

=== Deactivating the SSL certificate

You can deactivate an active SSL certificate temporarily or permanently. To do so, proceed as follows.

[.instruction]
Deactivating the SSL certificate:

. Go to **Start » plentymarkets account » Service center » Tab: Domain**.
. Click on the **blue plus icon** to open your __**main domain**__.
. Click on the **Deactivate SSL certificate** button. +
→ Your SSL certificate will be deactivated.

You can reactivate your SSL certificate at any time by clicking on the **Activate SSL certificate** button. It can take up to 4 hours for the SSL certificate to be deactivated or activated.

[TIP]
.Expiration date remains the same
====
The total validity period of your SSL certificate is not extended when it is temporarily deactivated.
====

=== External domain or external SSL

A domain can be hosted externally. The **external domain** then needs to be forwarded to us via A resource record (forwarding of the IP address).

The **SSL certificate** needs to be saved close to the system. This means even if the domain is hosted externally, the actual encoding is done directly in the system after the domain forwarding via IP address was carried out. For security reasons, it is not possible to use an external SSL certificate. The SSL certificate needs to be ordered from us.

[#client-store]
== Client (store)

In plentymarkets, the term <<omni-channel/online-store/setting-up-clients#, **client (store)**>> refers to additional online stores that are all managed with the same plentymarkets system as the default store. Go to **Start » plentymarkets account » Service Center » Tab: Client (store)** to see all of your clients (stores). If needed, you can also cancel clients (stores) in this menu.

=== Check: created domain?

You need to have a <<basics/working-with-plentymarkets#domain, **domain**>> before you can order a client (store). If needed, click on the **Domain** tab and create a domain for the main system.

=== Ordering a client (store)

Order a client (store) by opening the service center, clicking on the **Contract** tab and then clicking on the button **System configurator**. Use the system configurator to make the desired changes to your contract.

=== Canceling a client (store)

Go to **Start » plentymarkets account » Service center » Tab: Client (store)** and click on **Cancel client (store)** to cancel a client (store). Confirm the cancellation in the window that is displayed. The start and end of the contract will be displayed.

=== Editing the domain settings for clients (stores)

The tab **Client (store)** also displays information about the domains that are assigned to your clients. Make changes to these settings as described on the **<<basics/working-with-plentymarkets#domain, Domain>>** page of the manual.

[#cache]
== Cache

**plentymarkets » Start » plentymarkets account » Service center » Tab: Cache**

===  Cache function

The **static content** of your online store, e.g **item images**, are stored in the **cache** for a certain amount of time. This makes it possible to display such content as quickly as possible. If you make changes, e.g. to an image, then these changes will not go into effect immediately. Rather, they will only become visible once a certain amount of time has passed. It may take up to one hour.

Take a look at our link:https://www.plentymarkets.co.uk/blog/Im-Rollout-Mehr-Geschwindigkeit-bei-durchgehender-SSL-Verschluesselung/b-1207/[**blog entry**] about this topic (only available in German).

===  Deactivating the cache temporarily

Additionally, you can deactivate your system's cache for a limited period of time. Select the start and the end of your deactivated cache from the drop-down menu. Once you have selected a time in the drop-down menu **From**, you will be able to select a subsequent time from the drop-down menu **To**.

===  Permanent SSL redirect

If you booked an SSL certificate, then your website will be completely encoded. The technology (SNI/TLS) is a common standard that has been used for years. It is supported by all current browsers. However, some of your visitors may use older browsers that do not support this standard. If you deactivate the SSL redirect, then visitors with older browsers will also be able to click through your online store. However, customers will only be able to place an order with current browsers. The sales order process is always encoded, even if the SSL redirect was deactivated. You can inform customers here that it is only possible to place an order with current browsers.

== Your agency

In the menu **Start » plentymarkets account » Service center » Tab: Your agency**, you can grant up to two plentymarkets certified service providers access to specific areas of your system. As such, you allow a design agency and/or a consultant to carry out the following tasks in your plentymarkets system:

* Your service provider can delete the cache or temporarily deactivate the cache whilst working on the design in order to work more efficiently.
* Your service provider can also view and answer your support tickets. In other words, your service provider can directly communicate with our support staff. Of course, you can still follow along with the discussion yourself.

=== Granting access to certified service providers

Proceed as described below to provide the agency and/or the consultant you work with access to the system areas described above:

[.instruction]
Assigning service providers:

== Memory capacity and traffic

**Start &gt; plentymarkets account &gt; Memory capacity &amp; traffic**

Don't forget to check and save your settings or changes!

===  Memory capacity and traffic

Each plentymarkets system comes with enough **memory capacity** and **traffic** to manage day-to-day business operations. Traffic is generated every time a customer visits your online store, clicks on various items, clicks on images to enlarge them, downloads files, etc.

Additional traffic is generated if you are registered with various **markets** e.g. Yatego, Amazon, eBay, etc.

**SOAP calls** also generate additional traffic, since they create connections to the server. Depending on the type of call, they may generate a substantial amount of traffic. You should optimize your calls, e.g. so that you do not retrieve all of the information, but rather only the changes.

[IMPORTANT]
.
====
For further information about SOAP calls, refer to the **SOAP API / Troubleshooting** page of the manual. There you will find information about the **SOAP log**.
====

Even more traffic is generated if your website is "scanned" by so-called **bots** (Info: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_crawler). Bots do the following: They look at your website and save it (content download = traffic). For example, a Google bot does this so that Google can find items from your store along with their descriptions. Bots are controlled by their own algorithms, which makes it impossible to predict when they will visit your website.

If your **collection of items** has expanded (meaning more images etc.) and more bots have discovered your page, then there will also be a higher amount of traffic.

You can check this by going to **Settings &gt; Client (store) &gt; Global settings &gt; Statistics** and looking at your **Webalizer statistics**.

In this menu, you will see your required **memory capacity**, the amount of **traffic** used as well as an overview of the available **data records** for items, auctions, sales orders and customers in your plentymarkets system. The number of items and traffic included in your system varies depending on the contract that was agreed upon. This means that you will be billed if you happen to exceed the amount of memory available to you. You can use this overview to help keep track of these parameters.

If you want to minimize the amount of **robots** accessing your website, then you can block them with the **robots.txt file**.

[WARNING]
.
====
The "robots.txt" file is **not a 100% guarantee**! +
For further information about robots, refer to: link:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robots_exclusion_standard[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robots_exclusion_standard] +
Pay attention to these points in order to avoid unnecessary traffic.
====

===  Displaying the parameters

Under **memory capacity &amp; traffic**, you can see the values that were used in **megabytes** (MB).

Under **data records**, you can see the **number** of individual data records that are saved in your plentymarkets system.

[#relocation]
== Relocation

Use the menu **Start » plentymarkets account » Relocation** to relocate your system to a different cloud free of charge. The **Relocation** menu also lists the status of any currently planned relocation projects and information about any previous relocation projects. Refer to our website for further information about the link:https://www.plentymarkets.co.uk/product/cloud-hosting/[**cloud solutions provided by plentymarkets**].

=== System relocation requirements

Make sure to fulfill the following requirements before you begin planning to relocate your system to a different cloud:

* Your domain must be managed by plentymarkets. If this is not the case, then relocate your <<basics/working-with-plentymarkets#domain, **main domain**>>.
* You must have a current plentymarkets cloud contract. If this is not the case, then change your link:https://www.plentymarkets.co.uk/prices/book-plentymarkets-classic/[**contract**].
* The system relocation must be scheduled to begin at least 2 days in the future.

[WARNING]
.Files on FTP server are not migrated
====
When your system is relocated to a different cloud, the FTP host address of the plentymarkets system also changes. The files stored on the old FTP host are not copied to the new FTP host address during relocation. You need to move the FTP files manually.
====

[WARNING]
.Changing the IP address in your external domain provider settings
====
The relocation changes the IP address of your system. You need to save your new IP address in your external domain provider settings to ensure that your online store is still accessible if you are working with an external domain provider. Please note that plentymarkets does not have access to your external domain provider's data and therefore can not change the IP address for you. You need to change the IP address yourself. Information on how to save your new IP address with your external domain provider can be found in the documentation of your provider. Your IP address will be displayed when you initiate the relocation in the *Start » plentymarkets account » Relocation* menu. In addition the IP address will be sent to you by email.
====

=== Planning a relocation

Proceed as described below to plan the relocation of your system to a different cloud. Please note that it is not possible to simultaneously relocate more than one system per cloud. As such, the relocation start time may be delayed.

[.instruction]
Planning a relocation:

. Go to **Start » plentymarkets account » Relocation**.
. Click on the **Plan relocation** tab.
. Select the target cloud, i.e. the cloud where you want to relocate your system to. +

→ The planned relocation will be displayed in the **Planned relocation** tab. It will be started at the time indicated.

[IMPORTANT]
.Store availability
====
For mid-sized systems, relocation takes approximately 20 minutes. However, the actual duration always depends on the volume of data that is to be relocated. Your plentymarkets system is available during this time. However, you can not save any changes in the system. The order process is deactivated in your online store while your system is being relocated. Therefore, choose a time when you do not anticipate a large amount of traffic. We recommend that you plan the relocation for the middle of the night.
====

=== Canceling a planned relocation

You can cancel a planned relocation any time before all of the processes in the menu **Start » plentymarkets account » Relocation » Tab: Planned relocation** have been completed. The relocation will be canceled as soon as possible. It may not be possible to cancel the relocation immediately. Proceed as described below to cancel a planned relocation.

[.instruction]
Canceling a relocation:

. Go to **Start » plentymarkets account » Relocation**.
. Click on the **Planned relocation** tab.
. Click on **Cancel relocation**. +
→ The relocation will be canceled as soon as possible. Processes that were already completed will be relocated back to the previous cloud.

If all processes have already been completed, i.e. if the system has been relocated completely, you will need to request a new relocation to move your system back to the previous cloud.
