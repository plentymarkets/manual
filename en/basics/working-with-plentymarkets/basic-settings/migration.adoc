== General information about migration

In this menu, you will find information about **migrating** your data. The submenus change depending on the requirements of the system. You will currently see a submenu for migrating bank details. This submenu helps you switch your customers' bank data to the SEPA payment process. You will also see a submenu for migrating free text fields.

== Migrating bank details

As part of the **SEPA** initiative (Single Euro Payments Area), euro payments will be standardized in Germany and 32 other European countries starting on February 1st, 2014. This menu contains an automatic process for migrating the bank details.

For further information, refer to the **<<order-processing/payment/managing-bank-details#200, SEPA payments >>** page of the manual.

Migrate the **bank details** of all customers who pay with debit. Those are the customers who use the payment method **debit** or who have **subscription sales orders** in the **Scheduler** menu.

== Migrating free text fields

Starting with plentymarkets version 5.1, free text fields will be replaced by the customer __**characteristics**__ that are configured under <<crm/managing-customer-data#400, **Settings » Customers » Characteristics** >>. Use the **Migration** menu to change your free text fields into characteristics.

=== Preparation

First create <<crm/managing-customer-data#400, **characteristics** >> that match your existing free text fields. Make sure that the characteristics were assigned to the same __**type**__ as the free text fields. For example, use the type **Number** if a number should be saved or use the type **Text (single line)** if a name or city should be entered into the text field. The free text field type **Number** can also be migrated to the characteristic type **Selection**.

[TIP]
.Check the characteristics
====
Before migrating the data, check to make sure that you created __**characteristics**__ for all of the free text fields that should be migrated.
====

Only migrate the data if all of the necessary characteristics are available and were correctly configured.

=== Implementation

Go to **Migration** (see path above).
