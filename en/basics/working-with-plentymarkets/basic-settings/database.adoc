In this menu, you can execute two procedures that will edit or delete large amounts of data in the database. Do not execute these procedures without first checking them carefully as your data will be deleted irreversibly.

== Delete unused item categories

With this function, you can delete **unused item categories**. No item data will be affected by doing so.
