Changing the CSS of the editor

The <<omni-channel/online-store/setting-up-clients/cms#web-design-tools-editor, editor>> uses the *CSSContent* by default. If a background image is used there and this is bothersome or not desired, then you can individually edit the CSS in the menu *System » System settings » Settings » Editors » Tab: CSS*. Alternatively, you can use the *Standard*-CSS with a white background. You can also create your own *customized* CSS and specify additional formatting, e.g. how headings should be displayed.

Open the menu *System » System settings » Settings » Editors » Tab: CSS* to change the CSS for the editor.

[.instruction]
Changing the CSS for the editor:

. Open the menu *System » System settings » Settings » Editors » Tab: CSS*.
. Select the CSS. Pay attention to the explanations given in <<table-css-editors>>.
. *Save* the settings.
