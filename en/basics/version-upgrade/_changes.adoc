:description: Overview of changes to the item architecture in plentymarkets 7
:position: 20

This page provides you with a short overview of the most important changes in plentymarkets 7. The overview helps users get started with plentymarkets 7 after they have migrated their data. This description is geared towards experienced plentymarkets users. If you are unfamiliar with a certain function in plentymarkets, then take a look at the corresponding pages of the manual first.

[WARNING]
.SOAP API only available for plentymarkets 7 Classic
====
After migrating to plentymarkets 7, the SOAP API is only available for customers with a Classic contract. Customers with a Zero contract cannot use the SOAP API. All plentymarkets 7 customers can use the REST API.
====

== Items

=== Menu structure

**Item » Edit item » Open item**

* The menu **Item » Edit item** provides you with an overview of all your items, variations or your items along with their variations. Use the **Table type** search option to select which data you want to see.
* A tab for the main variation is included in the menu **Item » Edit item » Open item** by default. This tab cannot be closed.
* Further item variations are listed within the **Variations** tab. Click on a variation to open it.
* Once a variation has been opened, it will appear in a new tab to the right of the main variation. These tabs can be closed.

=== New items

**Item » Edit item » Button: New**

* A main variation is always created when a new item is created. This main variation cannot be deleted.
* Attributes can be selected when a new item is created. It will be possible to use these attributes for all of the item's variations. If you create an item without attributes, then it will be possible to select all of the attributes that are available in the system when you create variations later. Once you have created a variation with attributes, it will only be possible to create additional variations with these attributes or without any attributes.
* When creating a new item, you select between the item types **Default** and **Set**. An item set consists of several items. Customers can choose one of the variations of each of these items to make an individual set. In contrast to item bundles, when you offer sets, customers can select one of several variations for each product added to the Set item.

=== Data formats

**Data » Dynamic export**

* Incompatible item data formats are removed during migration.

== Variations

=== Menu structure

**Item » Edit item » Open item » Open variation**

* Variations have their own **Images** tab.

=== New variations

**Item » Edit item » Open item » Tab: Variations » Button: New**

* Variations are created by defining the content and selecting the available attributes.
* The number of variations that are created depends on the combinations of available attributes. The number of selected and possible combinations is displayed in the bottom right corner.

=== Variation search

You can search for variations in the following menus:

.Different ways to search for variations
[cols="1,3"]
|====
|Menu |Explanation

|**Item » Edit item**
|New search filters **Variation ID** and **Variation number** as well as the table type **Variation**

|**Item » Edit item » Open item » Tab: Variations**
|Searches for variations that belong to the item. It includes filters for the attributes that were assigned.

|**Item » Edit item » Open item » Tab: Variations » Button: New**
|Searches for the attributes that were saved for the item. This makes it possible to create new variations with these attributes.
|====

=== Inheritance of variation characteristics

When a variation is created, it will inherit settings from the main variation. If you want to use different settings for the variation, then you will need to deactivate the inheritance function for the variation and carry out new settings.

The following table illustrates the various types of variation characteristics that can be inherited. The table lists the visual appearance, the behaviour and the process for deactivating the inheritance.

.Inheritance logic
[cols="1,3,3,3"]
|====
|Type of setting |Appearance if inheritance is active |Behaviour |Deactivation

|**Drop-down list**
|The first value in the drop-down list is the setting for the main variation. Inherited values are displayed in grey font. Empty fields can also be inherited.
|Only inherited if the first value is selected.
|Inheritance is deactivated as soon as you select a value that differs from the main variation.

|**Checkbox**
|Checkbox with a red line through it. Next to it is a checkbox with the setting for the main variation.
|3 possible conditions: +
**Activated** (check mark) +
**Deactivated** (no check mark) +
**Inherit** (crossed out)
|Click on the checkbox with a line through it

|**Text field**
|Inherited values are displayed in grey font. Empty fields can also be inherited.
|Inheritance is automatically deactivated if a text field is cleared, filled with text or if the inherited content is edited.
|If you want to have empty fields in the variations, then you need to leave the field blank in the main variation and instead manage this data in the variations.

|**Text fields with 1:n links**
|Inherited values are displayed in grey font.
|Either all or none of the data is inherited. It is not possible for only some of the data to be inherited.
|Use the button in the header area to deactivate the inheritance. +
The inheritance is automatically deactivated if a value is changed or added to the variation. Unchanged values are inherited and saved directly for the variation. If the inheritance is activated again, then all of the values will be deleted and taken from the main variation again.
|====

=== Variation characteristics

Some characteristics that were previously managed for each item in the old architecture are now managed for each variation. The following tables list the variation characteristics that are now managed for each variation. The tables list the characteristics for each of the variation's tabs. The inheritance logic is also described.

=== Splitting payments

Manually booked incoming payments, imported bank postings as well as EBICS and HBCI payments can be split in the **Orders » Payments** menu. In this way, one payment can be assigned to multiple orders. Note that interim transaction reports cannot be split. To split payments, proceed as follows.

[.instruction]
Splitting a payment:

. Go to **Orders » Payments**.
. In the line of an incoming payment, click on **Split payment**. +
→ The **Split payment** window will open and a list with all open orders will be displayed.
. Filter the orders if needed.
. Place a check mark next to the orders that you want to assign to the payment.
. Click on **Execute**. +
⇒ The selected orders are assigned to the payment.

[NOTE]
.Newly assigned payments in the overview after splitting a payment
====
After clicking on **Reload**, new entries assigned to the previously selected orders will be created in the payments overview. In addition, an unassigned entry will also be created if there is a remaining amount of the split payment. Then again, the unassigned entry can be split. In order to restore or delete the previously split payment, delete all payments assigned by splitting first.
====

=== Klarna Checkout

When updating to plentymarkets 7 and changing to the Amazon Cloud, the code in the Select the country category must be changed. Update the <<order-processing/payment/klarna-checkout#100, code for Klarna Checkout>> in the category of the **Container** type.

=== arvato infoscore

[IMPORTANT]
.Note
====
As previously announced, arvato infoscore cannot be accounted with plentymarkets from version 7 on. Now, arvato and plentymarkets have reached the decision to end the cooperation on 31/09/2017. Starting 01/10/2017, the interface to plentymarkets 6 will cease to function. We apologise for any inconvenience caused.

You can find information on an alternative to arvato  link:https://www.plentymarkets.eu/blog/Unsere-Partnerschaft-mit-arvato-endet-ndash-die-Alternative-lautet-atriga/b-1908/[here^] (German language only).
====

== SOAP API

All calls have been updated for plentymarkets 7. However, some calls should no longer be used because of the different item architectures in plentymarkets 6 and plentymarkets 7. These calls no longer return results. This page provides a list of calls that already process data in the new item architecture. You will also find a 2nd list of calls, which require special attention. Here you will need to pay extra attention to which value is specified for a parameter or which value is transmitted.

The following calls can no longer be used in plentymarkets 7. They are listed in alphabetical order.

* GetItemsPreviewLink
* GetDeliveryCharges
* GetMarketplaceTransactions

The following calls contain parameters that require extra attention or that may not be intuitive from their parameter name:[#120]

[cols="1,3"]
|====
|Parameter |Explanation

2+|DeleteItems

|**ItemID**
|Specify a variation ID as the value for the request parameter ItemID to delete variations.

|**ExternalItemID**
|Specify a variation ID as the value for the request parameter ExternalItemID. This is because the prices are assigned to the variation.

2+|DeletePriceSets

|**ItemID**
|Specify a variation ID as the value for the request parameter ItemID. This is because the prices are assigned to the variation.

|**PriceID**
|Specify the ID of a sales price for the request parameter PriceID. Specify the ID of whichever sales price you want to delete from the variation. Pay attention to which sales prices and prices were assigned to each other in the menu SOAP migration.

2+|GetItemsBase

|**GetAttributeValueSets**
|If the value was set to **true** for this parameter, then all of the item's variations have to be listed in the SOAP response. A variation's parameter structure must exactly match the main variation's structure. Due to the new item architecture, all of an item's variations are directly listed as PlentySoapObject_ItemBase and no longer as PlentySoapObject_ItemAttributeValueSet. If the parameter GetAttributeValueSets is not set to true, then only the item's main variation has to be displayed in the SOAP response.

|**PlentySoapObject_ItemAttributeValueSet**
|The parameter is ignored for plentymarkets 7. Due to the new item architecture, all of an item's variations are directly listed as PlentySoapObject_ItemBase.

2+|GetItemsPriceLists

|**PlentySoapObject_ItemPriceSet**
|The parameter PlentySoapObject_ItemPriceSet is displayed for every customer class in the response. This allows you to tell which price set applies to the customer class. You can recognise the customer classes with the response parameter ShowOnly. 0 means that the price set applies to all customer classes. 1 means that the price set only applies to B2C customers. 2 means that the price set applies to B2B customer classes.

2+|GetItemsSuppliers

|**ItemID**
|The variation ID has to be specified as the value for the parameter ItemID.

2+|GetItemsTexts

|**ItemNumber**
|The variation number has to be specified as the value for the parameter ItemNumber.

|**ExternalItemNumber**
|The external variation number has to be specified as the value for the parameter ExternalItemNumber.

2+|GetItemsUpdated

|
|The variation's IDs are returned in the response.

2+|GetLinkPriceColumnToReferrer

|**PriceColumnID**
|The ID of the sales price is returned in the PriceColumnID parameter.

2+|GetMarketListingItemVariants

|
|The variation IDs are returned in the response message.

2+|GetMultiShops

|**ItemPriceColumn**
|The parameter ItemPriceColumn can no longer be called in plentymarkets 7. This is because price columns are no longer used in plentymarkets 7.

2+|SetAttributeValueSetsDetails

|**MaxStock**
|A variation's maximum stock can not be transferred using this call. Use the call **SetItemsWarehouseSettings** to transfer a variation's maximum stock.

|**StockBuffer**
|A variation's stock buffer cannot be transferred using this call. Use the call **SetItemsWarehouseSettings** to transfer a variation's stock buffer.

2+|SetItemAttributeLinks

|**ItemID +
AttributeID +
AttributeValueID**
|Item variations can be created with this call. The request parameters ItemID, AttributeID and AttributeValueID are mandatory.

|**Activate**
|The request parameter Activate is outdated. The variation's attributes and attribute values will automatically be activated when the variation is created.

|**AttributeExtraCost**
|The request parameter AttributeExtraCost is also outdated due to the new sales prices.

2+|SetItemAttributeVariants

|**AttributeValueIDs**
|The call is used to delete variations. Delete a variation by specifying the item ID in the parameter ItemID and by specifying which attribute value should be deleted in the parameter AttributeValueIDs. You will also need to set the request parameter delete to **true**.

2+|SetItemAvailability

|**AvailabilityID**
|The variation ID has to be specified as the value for the parameter AvailabilityID.

2+|SetItemsBase

|
a| This call can be used to create new items, to edit existing items and to edit variations. You will need to pay attention to different parameters depending on what you want to do. +
The following parameters are mandatory for creating new items:
* ItemNo
* Texts
* Categories
* PriceSet

Enter the value of a price set for the parameter PriceSet. Enter the value of whichever price set was assigned to the new sales prices. You will not be able to create an item if you do not assign the prices. +
If you want to edit an existing item, then specify the item ID in the parameter ItemID. +
If you want to edit a variation, then specify the variation ID as the value for the parameter PriceID. +
For the input parameter BaseItems.PlentySoapObject_SetItemsBaseItemBase.VATInternalID, do not enter the ID of the internal system VAT rate. Instead, enter the value 19 for 19%, the value 7 for 7% and the value 0 for 0%.

2+|SetItemCategory

|**ItemID**
|The variation ID has to be specified as the value for the parameter ItemID.

2+|SetItemsDefaultCategory

|**ItemID**
|The variation ID has to be specified as the value for the parameter ItemID.

2+|SetMarketListings

|**AttributeValueSetID**
|The variation ID has to be specified as the value for the parameter AttributeValueSetID.

2+|SetItemsSuppliers

|**ItemID**
|The variation ID has to be specified as the value for the parameter ItemID.

== Customer

The customer data area is currently being restructured. The rigid customer data model will be transferred into a flexible data model. This new model is a useful compromise of the requirements of a classic B2C online seller and a flexible CRM system.

You will not recognise the changes at first sight since the UI initially remains the same. It will be adapted gradually in the course of the project. The advantage of this procedure to transfer the changes little by little is that the scope of changes remains comprehensible making it possible to flexibly organise the project.

The most important changes are listed in the following:

* The current customer data record consisting of company, customer and address data will be split in individual components (see chapter <<basics/version-upgrade/changes#10, Definition>>).
* If an order is made via a guest account, no contact data record will be created. Instead only invoice and delivery address will be saved in the order to be able to correctly process the order.
* It is no longer possible to save customer characteristics for guest orders.
* It is no longer possible that multiple regular accounts with the same email address exist. During migration of these accounts, it will be checked which of these customer data records with at least one order was created last. The most current customer data record with the highest ID will be kept as regular account; all other accounts will be converted into a guest account.
* The contact is equivalent to a person. This person can optionally be linked to one company or multiple companies.
* You can link n addresses of various types to one contact.
* A contact may have n contact options, e.g. multiple telephone numbers, multiple email addresses.
* All addresses will be based on one model and one data structure. The type (invoice address, delivery address, more types will follow) will be defined within the link. This means that, e.g., one individual address data record can be linked to the same order both as invoice address and as delivery address.
* At least one invoice address and one delivery address is linked to an order.
* Each contact option must be defined by a type and a sub-type. This is important for clarity reasons and to define where it is used.
* During migration, a company will not be created automatically for every contact. A company data record will only be created if the company name and in addition a payment due date, sales representative, VAT number or customer number are available.
* If an address is created, an automatic check for duplicates will be carried out in the background. If the address already exists in the system, it will be linked to the existing data record (contact or order). In this case, no second address will be created.
* During migration, the customer **Cash sale** which is available as a standard in version 6 and has the ID **-1** will receive a regular ID. This ID will be automatically assigned from the available ID range and saved in the system.

Image 1 shows an overview of the new structure in the are of customer data.

=== Planned sequence of the migration

The migration will be carried out in several steps. First, the new data tables will be created. Afterwards, these data tables will be filled with the existing data. In the course of the project, the new program code will be released. The last step includes a synchronisation of the delta between the data records already migrated and current data records. Systems that are currently in version beta 7 will be updated automatically.
