[TIP]
.States of development and version updates
====
plentymarkets is constantly updated and optimised. The version life cycle of plentymarkets consists of the states of development *Beta*, *Early* und *Stable*. By default, your system is set to the *Stable* version. However, if you want to benefit from improvements and new features earlier, you can set your system to a version with <<basics/admin-tasks/version-cycle#, an earlier state of development>>. Your current version of plentymarkets is displayed in your plentymarkets back end when you point your cursor at the login icon.

A beta version, an early version and a stable version normally are released once a week. You system is updated automatically when a new version is published. The plentymarkets changelog lists the changes made for each update. You can find this changelog in the plentymarkets Forum in the link:https://forum.plentymarkets.com/c/changelog[Changelog^] category. We recommend that you subscribe to this category. You will then be notified whenever a new changelog entry is published.

=== Changing your contract

plentymarkets grows along with your needs. Decide for yourself how many orders you want to process with plentymarkets each month. We will provide you with the necessary system performance. The *Contract* tab allows you to make changes in your plentymarkets contract on your own once it is up and running. It makes sense to make changes to your contract e.g. if you generate more orders than are included in your current rate. It is possible to book a higher rate at any time. If you book a lower rate, the change will go into effect once the regular duration of your current contract has ended.

=== Information about domains

<<table-account-domains>> includes explanations of the various domain types.

[[table-account-domains]]
.Examples of domains
[cols="1,1,1,1,4"]
|====
|Type |Additional information |Example name |TLD |Explanation

|Domain
|--
|yourstore
|.uk
|The word "domain" refers to an Internet address in the form of a name and an extension, i.e. the top level domain. The name can be chosen freely. A domain is unique, i.e. the exact same domain may never be used twice. Therefore, when registering a desired domain, e.g. with a hosting service provider, it is necessary to check whether the domain has already been used.

|Subdomain
|info.
|yourstore
|.uk
|You create as many subdomains as desired for a domain. Subdomains do not need to be registered. Subdomains use variations of the domain name. They are either placed in front of or behind the domain name and they are separated from it with a period.

|Additional domains
|--
|your-store +
your_store
|.uk
|Additional domains are e.g. created with alternative names of the main domain. Additional domains point to the main domain to ensure that the domain is also found if it is spelled differently. For the example domain, an additional domain **your-store.com** could be useful. This would allow the main domain **yourstore.com** to be accessed even if a hyphen was used in the spelling. The names and top level domains can be chosen freely for additional domains. Every additional domain receives the main domain's IP address.

You will also receive information about how much it costs to use the domain per month. Enter the contact details (domain handle) and assign the corresponding plentymarkets system. Then order the domain by clicking on **Place order**.

[IMPORTANT]
.Registering .com domains
====
You will receive an email when registering a .com domain. This email will ask you to confirm the WHOIS data that was entered. This email is sent to the email address that was entered under ADMIN-C in the handle data (WHOIS). If you do not receive an email, check that the email address is available and working.
====

[#80]
==== Relocating a domain

If the domain is already available, you can relocate it. To do so, proceed as described in the chapter **Ordering a new domain**. Follow the instructions in the menu. Also note the following information regarding domain transfers:

* Have your current provider's authentication code ready as you will need to enter this code.
* The processing times may vary depending on the Top Level Domain.
** For **.de** domains: up to 24 hours
** For **.com** and **.net** domains: 3 to 7 days
** For **.eu** domains: up to 5 days
* You will receive an email if you relocate a **.com** or **.net** domain. The email will ask you to confirm the relocation. This email is sent to the email address that was entered under ADMIN-C in the handle data (WHOIS). If you do not receive an email, check that the email address is available and working. If the email address no longer exists, then ask your current domain provider to change the email address.

[#90]
==== Creating an external domain

Use the option **Create a new external domain** to link an existing external domain to a plentymarkets system. The domain's IP address will be displayed in the overview of domains. Next, save the DNS data in the DNS zone of the hosting service provider. To find this DNS information, go to the Service Centre and open the newly created external domain. The DNS data is shown in the *Current DNS settings* area. If there is an IPv6 A Record in your externally managed domain, then remove this IPv6 A-Record.

[#100]
==== Ordering a subdomain

You can create as many subdomains as you want for a domain. You do not need to register these subdomains. For example, if you have the domain **yourstore.com**, then you could create the subdomain **info.yourstore.com** to provide special information about your online store with this domain. Use the drop-down list to select which main domain you want to link with the subdomain. Select the corresponding plentymarkets system as well.

[IMPORTANT]
.Availability and updates
====
It can take up to 24 hours for new domains or changes to become available. This is because the servers need to be restarted periodically and the data is not distributed in the cloud immediately.

=== Saving the CNAME Resource Record

A Canonical Name or CNAME record is a type of DNS record that links an alias name to another canonical domain name. For example, you can use it along with the provider **Shopgate** to create a mobile version of your online store or you can use it to set up an external email service. In the example, the source _mobile.your-shop.com_ is the mobile version of the domain _your-shop.com_. Use the Shopgate subdomain _cname.shopgate.com_ as the target. This CNAME entry ensures that your store will have the correct resolution with Shopgate.

[#250]
=== Relocating a domain

If you want to switch to a different webhosting provider, then you will need to carry out a domain name transfer (also known as a KK or auth info procedure in Germany). You need to fill out a standardized form of authorization in order for the domain to be transferred. The German form is called a connectivity coordination application, abbreviated as a KK-Antrag. The connectivity coordination application regulates the switch from one provider to another. The auth info procedure is becoming more and more popular.

Please note the following points when switching to a different web hosting provider:

* Generate an <<basics/admin-tasks/plentymarkets-account#domain-auth-code, auth code>>.
* Do not delete your previous domain name with your current provider.
* Tell your current provider about your plans to transfer the domain and let them know that they will soon receive an authorization form.
* Contact the new provider in regards to the transfer. Your new provider will ask you to sign a form and confirm that you want to transfer the domain.

It is usually possible to transfer the domain without any problems. The process can be completed in a short amount of time. However, if you have any problems with the domain transfer because of incomplete or unclear data, then your old provider may initially reject the transfer. In such a case, contact the old provider as soon as possible. The current provider can only accept the transfer once there are no further uncertainties.

[TIP]
.IPS tag
====
If you want to transfer your **.uk** or **co.uk** domain to plentymarkets from a different domain provider, you need to have your current domain provider adapt the IPS tag in advance. The IPS tag of our domain provider is:

**UNITEDDOMAINS-DE**

[#ssl-certificate]
== Managing the SSL certificate

This chapter provides you with information about SSL certificates. You will find out how to check for the expiration date of your SSL certificate and how to order a new SSL certificate or deactivate your active SSL certificate if necessary.

[#280]
=== What is an SSL certificate?

An SSL certificate is used to encrypt your website. A SSL certificate also provides a secure connection to your website and online store. An SSL certificate is required for certain markets and for receiving the Trusted Shops certification. Your customers can see when you are using an SSL certificate as your website will be accessed via _https_.

SSL certificates are offered by independent certificate providers. plentymarkets offers two types of SSL certificates:

* You can buy a SSL certificate which is valid for at least a year. This certificate is not renewed. After the SSL certificate expires, you need to order a new certificate.
* You can order a free SSL certificate from link:https://letsencrypt.org[Let’s Encrypt^]. It is renewed automatically and can be terminated with one month notice.

You order the SSL certificate for your <<basics/admin-tasks/plentymarkets-account#domain, main domain>>, i.e. the one that you set as the main domain in the *Start » Service Centre » Tab: Domain* menu (image 2, blue arrow). If you want to use an SSL certificate for a different domain, you will have to set this domain as your main domain first.

.plentymarkets Service center; domains
image::basics/working-with-plentymarkets/assets/ENG-Start-pm-Konto-Cache02-SI.png[plentymarkets Service center; domains]

[IMPORTANT]
.No SSL certificates for cancelled domains or test domains
====
You cannot order SSL certificates for cancelled domains or for start-up domains and test domains, i.e. domains with names that contain _plenty-testdrive.eu_, _plentymarkets-x1.com_ etc. For this reason, the **Order SSL certificate** button is not displayed for these types of domains.
====

[#360]
=== SSL certificate for external domains

A domain can be hosted externally. The <<basics/admin-tasks/plentymarkets-account#150, DNS settings then have to be saved with the external provider of the domain>>. However, the SSL certificate needs to be saved close to the system. This means that even if the domain is hosted externally, the actual encoding is done directly in the system after the domain forwarding via IP address is carried out. As such, it is not possible to use an external SSL certificate. The SSL certificate needs to be ordered from plentymarkets.

=== Prerequisites for booking an SSL certificate

Before booking an SSL certificate, ensure that the following prerequisites are met:

==== Domain

* The domain for which you want to order the SSL certificate must be a <<basics/admin-tasks/plentymarkets-account#210a, main domain>> that has been activated in the plentymarkets Service Centre. +
→ Check the settings in the plentymarkets Service Centre.

==== Active autoscaling

A few system have not been switched to link:https://aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/[autoscaling] (AS). In most cases, this is because the domain is not hosted by plentymarkets. As such, the domain owner must adjust the DNS settings manually. +
Another cause might be that the domain was added to a client for the first time. These clients are not automatically switched to autoscaling. Instead, the plentymarkets support staff need to switch activate autoscaling manually.

Proceed as described below to check if autoscaling is active:

[.instruction]
Checking the autoscaling status:

. Go to **Start » Service Centre**. +
*_Tip:_* To do so, point your cursor at the plentymarkets logo at the top left of the screen. +
→ The Service Centre opens in a new browser tab.
. Click on the blue **plus* icon of the system. +
→ The available tabs are shown.
. Click on the *Domain* tab.
. Click on the blue plus icon next to the domain to view the DNS settings. +
→ The DNS settings are shown.
. In the column *DNS Record Type*, check if a CNAME entry exists. +
→ If a CNAME entry exists, autoscaling is active. +
→ If no CNAME entry exists but two A records, autoscaling is not active.
. If autoscaling is not active, contact the plentymarkets Support via the Link:https://forum.plentymarkets.com/t/46996/[plentymarkets Forum] and ask them to activate autoscaling. The thread is in German, but support staff also speaks English.

==== For subdomains: Existing parent domain

If you want to order an SSL certificate for a subdomain, the parent domain must also exist in the system. In addition, the relationship between domain and subdomain must be entered correctly in the Service Centre. +
→ Check the settings in the plentymarkets Service Centre. +
→ If you deleted the parent domain from the Service Centre, create the parent domain. If you do not want this parent domain to point to plentymarkets, save an external A record for the parent domain by <<basics/admin-tasks/plentymarkets-account#210a, creating a system link>>.

==== For external domains: DNS settings

* The <<basics/admin-tasks/plentymarkets-account#150, DNS settings saved with the external provider>> must be identical to the DNS settings of the plentymarkets Service Center. +
→ Check the settings in the service area of your domain provider.
* No IPv6 entry (AAAA record) must exist for the domain. +
→ Check the settings in the service area of your domain provider.
* Any existing CAA records for the domain must allow ordering the selected certificate. +
→ Check the settings in the service area of your domain provider.

[#300]
=== Managing a bought SSL certificate

If you buy an SSL certificate, you need to order a new SSL certificate before your old certificate expires. This means that even if you already own an SSL certificate that is about to expire, you still select a certificate provider and duration from scratch. That means that you need to select a certificate provider and the certification duration every time you order an SSL certificate. plentymarkets orders the SSL certificate on your behalf and bills you for the one-off purchase price and the monthly fee.

[#310]

[#410]
[#cache]
== Managing the cache

The static content of your online store, e.g. item images, are stored in the cache for a certain amount of time. This makes it possible to display such content as quickly as possible. If you make changes, e.g. to an image, then these changes will not go into effect immediately. Rather, they will only become visible once a certain amount of time has passed. It may take up to one hour. Take a look at our link:https://www.plentymarkets.eu/blog/Im-Rollout-Mehr-Geschwindigkeit-bei-durchgehender-SSL-Verschluesselung/b-1207/[blog entry] on this topic (only available in German).

=== Permanent SSL redirect

If you booked an SSL certificate, your website will be completely encrypted. The technology SNI/TLS is a common standard that has been used for years. It is supported by all current browsers. However, some of your visitors may use older browsers that do not support this standard. If you deactivate the SSL redirect, then visitors with older browsers will also be able to click through your online store. However, customers will only be able to place an order with current browsers. The order process is always encoded, even if the SSL redirect was deactivated. You can inform customers that it is only possible to place an order with current browsers.

In the menu **Start » Service Centre » Tab: Your agency**, you can grant up to two plentymarkets certified service providers access to specific areas of your system. As such, you allow a design agency and/or a consultant to carry out the following tasks in your plentymarkets system:

* Your service provider can delete the cache or temporarily deactivate the cache whilst working on the design in order to work more efficiently.
* Your service provider can also view and answer your support tickets. In other words, your service provider can directly communicate with the plentymarkets support staff. Of course, you can still follow along with the discussion yourself.

[#450]

* Tab **Contract**: Your current rate is shown. However, the agency cannot change your contract details.
* Tab **Cache**: The agency can delete the cache or temporarily deactivate the cache of your system.
* Tab **Tickets**: The service provider has access to the information in the **My account area** under **Tickets**. In other words, the agency's employees can create and answer tickets.

[#470]
== Managing hosting data

The data volume and traffic depend on your contract. You will be billed if you exceed the amount of memory available to you. As such, you can track the data volume your plentymarkets system uses at any time.

[#480]
=== Viewing usage data

Go to **Start » Hosting » Tab: Usage** to view the usage data of your system. <<table-account-usage>> provides an overview of the data you have used.

[[table-account-usage]]
.Usage data shown
[cols="1,3"]
|====
|Data |Explanation

|**Month**|Month of usage

|**Total web space**|Maximum memory capacity that was occupied in this month, in GB

|**Document web space**|Maximum memory capacity that was occupied by documents in this month, in GB

|**Traffic**|Traffic in GB

|**DB**|Maximum database volume that was used in this month, in GB

|**Faceted search**|Number of faceted searches in your online store

|**Items in faceted search**|Number of items in the faceted search
|====

[#490]
=== Information about traffic

Traffic is generated every time a customer visits your online store, clicks on various items, clicks on images to enlarge them, downloads files, etc.

Additional traffic is generated in the following cases:

* When exchanging data with markets.
* SOAP and REST calls also generate additional traffic, since these calls create connections to the server. +
**__Tip:__** Depending on the type of call, they may generate a substantial amount of traffic. You should optimize your calls, e.g. so that you do not retrieve all of the information, but rather only the changes.
* When your website is scanned by link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_crawler[bots^]. The bots save you pages, which results in traffic. For example, a Google bot does this so that Google can find items from your store along with their descriptions. Bots are controlled by proprietary algorithms, which makes it impossible to predict when such bots will visit your website. +
*_Tip:_* To take some control of bot behaviour, you can block bots using the robots.txt file.
* If your product portfolio has expanded, resulting in more data and images, more bots will crawl your site, resulting in more traffic. This is because by adding more data, your site draws the attention of more bots.

[#500]
== Requesting a system relocation

Use the menu **Start » Relocation** to relocate your system to a different cloud free of charge. The **Relocation** menu also lists the status of any planned relocation projects and information about any previous relocation projects. Refer to our website for further information about the link:http://www.plentymarkets.co.uk/product/cloud-hosting/[ cloud solutions provided by plentymarkets].

[#510]
=== System relocation requirements

Make sure that the following requirements are met before you begin planning to relocate your system to a different cloud:

* You must have a current plentymarkets cloud contract. If you do not have a plentymarkets Cloud contract, change your link:http://www.plentymarkets.eu/preise/plentymarkets-classic-buchen/[contract information].
* The system relocation must be scheduled to begin at least 2 days in the future.

[WARNING]
.Files on FTP server are not migrated
====
When your system is relocated to a different cloud, the FTP host address of the plentymarkets system also changes. The files stored on the old FTP host are not copied to the new FTP host address during relocation. You need to move the FTP files manually.
====

[WARNING]
.Changing the IP address with your external domain provider
====
When you relocate your system, your IP address changes. If your domain is hosted by an external provider, you need to save the DNS settings of your plentymarkets system with your external domain provider to ensure that your online store remains functional. plentymarkets employees do not have access to the data of your external domain and cannot make these changes for you. Check the documentation of your domain provider to find out how to save your new IP address there.
====

[#520]
=== Planning a relocation

Proceed as described below to plan the relocation of your system to a different cloud. Please note that it is not possible to simultaneously relocate more than one system per cloud. As such, the relocation start time may be delayed.

[.instruction]
Planning a relocation:

. Go to **Start » Relocation**. +
**__Tip:__** To do so, point your cursor at the plentymarkets logo at the top left of the screen. +
. Click on the **Relocation** tab.

→ The planned relocation is shown in the **Planned relocation** tab and starts at the specified time. +
**__Note:__** Only one system can be relocated per cloud. As such, the relocation start time may be delayed.

[IMPORTANT]
.Store availability
====
For mid-sized systems, relocation takes approximately 20 minutes. However, the actual duration always depends on the volume of data that is to be relocated. Your plentymarkets system is available during this time. However, you cannot save any changes in the system. The order process is deactivated in your online store while your system is being relocated. Therefore, choose a time when you do not anticipate a large amount of traffic. We recommend that you plan the relocation for the middle of the night.
====

[#530]
=== Cancelling a planned relocation

You can cancel a planned relocation at any time before all of the processes in the menu **Start » Relocation » Tab: Planned relocation** have been completed. The relocation will be cancelled as soon as possible. It may not be possible to cancel the relocation immediately. Proceed as described below to cancel a planned relocation.

[.instruction]
Cancelling a relocation:

. Go to **Start » Relocation**. +
**__Tip:__** To do so, point your cursor at the plentymarkets logo at the top left of the screen.
. Click on the **Planned relocation** tab.
. Click on **Cancel relocation**. +
→ The relocation is cancelled as soon as possible. Processes that were already completed will be relocated back to the source cloud.

If all processes have already been completed, i.e. if the system has been relocated completely, you will need to request a new relocation to move your system back to the previous cloud.
