== General information about tags

Tags are **__keywords__** that can be used to mark texts and pages. In plentymarkets, tags are created and managed centrally in one menu. The tags can then be used in different areas, such as in **categories** and the **ticket system** (image 2). Tags can also contain spaces. When a tag consists of more than one word then it is possible to separate these words with spaces.

== Creating a tag

The following section explains how to create tags.
