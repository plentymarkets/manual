== Areas

The **Editor**, **Syntax editor** and **Text field** are activated in all areas by default. However, they can be deactivated in individual areas. Go to **Settings » Basic settings » Editors » Tab: Areas** and choose which editors should be displayed in the drop-down menu within each specific area.

== CSS of the editor

The **<<cms/web-design/tools/editor#, editor  >>** uses the CSS in the **CSSContent** area by default. If a __**background image**__ is used there and this is bothersome or not desired, then you can individually edit the CSS in this menu. Alternatively, you can use a __**white background**__ or you can create your own __**customized CSS**__ and specify additional formatting, e.g. how headings should be displayed.

== Configuration

Pay attention to the explanations given in table 1 and select the option as desired.
