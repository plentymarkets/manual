== Carrying out updates

Your plentymarkets system regularly checks whether an update is available for one of the menus or functions, e.g. whether a new feature or fix is ready to be imported. When an update is available, you will see a pop-up window that asks if you want to update the system now.

Click on **Reload page** if you want to update the system. Doing so will close all of the menus and tabs that are currently open. If you do not want this to happen, then click on **Later** and update the system at a later time.

Note: If you reload the page, then the cache will automatically be regenerated as well.
