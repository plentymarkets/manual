== Ideal image sizes for the ShopBuilder

There are 4 different aspect ratios for images in the *Image box* and *Image carousel* widgets. These ratios are dependent on whether the widget is integrated as a standalone or in a grid with 2, 3 or 4 columns as well as which layout setting is selected for the grid.

For image widgets that are integrated *without a grid* or in a *2 column grid* with the layout setting *50%:50%*, the ideal image aspect ratio of width to height is *3:1*. If you change the <<table-elements-shop-builder,layout settings>>, the aspect ratio changes to *2:1* (for 66.6% elements) and *1:1* (for 33.3% elements).

For image widgets in a *3 column grid* with the layout setting *30%:30%:30%*, the ideal image aspect ratio of width to height is *1.5:1*. Depending on the <<table-elements-shop-builder,layout settings>>, the aspect ratio changes according to the table below.

For image widgets in a *4 column grid*, the ideal image aspect ratio of width to height is *1:1*. The layout for this type of grid cannot be changed.
