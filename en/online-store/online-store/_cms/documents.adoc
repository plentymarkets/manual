*Content &gt; Documents*

Don't forget to check and save your settings or changes!

==  Documents

You can *upload documents* in this area. The documents can then, e.g. be sent to your customers as *email attachments* or they can be inserted into *content pages* with the help of wildcard characters.

==  Uploading a document

You can upload different data formats, e.g. images or PDFs. The procedure is the same in all cases. Please make sure that you have saved the documents to be uploaded on your computer beforehand. One example is the *terms and conditions* document. This document is often sent as an attachment to the order confirmation email. You can also upload *instructions* to your items, if you want to provide them to your customers as an email template.
