==  General information about forms

Create and edit forms in this menu. One example of a form is the contact form displayed in your online store. In this area, store visitors can enter their contact information along with a question or comment. After the visitor clicks on the submit button, the entries will be sent to the email address that was saved in the *System » System settings » Client » Select client » Email » Access data* menu. The template variable *{% Form(X) %}* is used to insert a form into your online store.

==  Creating a form

You can create a new form directly after opening up the menu. If you have clicked on one of the existing forms listed under the heading *FORMS* in the upper left corner, then you will not be able to create a new form until you have reloaded the menu. By reloading the menu, you change the screen back to its original appearance.

| Setting | Explanation

|*ID*
| The form ID is assigned by the system and can not be changed. The ID is used to insert a form into the online store.

|*Form name*
| Enter a name for the form.

|*Email subject*
| Enter an email subject. The text will be displayed in the subject line of all emails that are sent with the form. If you work with several different forms, then the subject can help you to recognize which form this email refers to. +
_*Important:*_ If you want the form to be imported into the ticket system, then you are required to enter a subject. If there is no subject, then the customer's email address will not be saved. This means that emails may be sent to your own address with an event procedure.

|*CC email address*
| Enter an email address. The entries made in the form will also be sent to this address (=CC).

|*Ticket type*
| Select a type if you want to import the form into the system as a ticket.

|*Ticket status*
| Select a status if you want to import the form into the system as a ticket.

|*Field name*
| Enter the field names for the form, e.g. Company, Last name, First name, email etc.

|*Type*
| Select the *data type* for the data field. On the one hand, the type determines how the entry field will be displayed in the form, e.g. as a *single-line entry field*, as a *multi-line text field* or as a *check box*. On the other hand, the system uses the type to recognize which information is entered by the customer, e.g. an email address, first name, last name or telephone number. This is important so that the information is assigned to the correct data field.

|*Width (pixels)*
| Enter the width of the data field (in pixels).

|*Mandatory field*
| Select the setting *YES* to indicate that a data field is mandatory. Mandatory fields will be displayed on the form in bold font.

==  Inserting a form in a category

Forms are inserted into a category in two steps. First, determine the ID of the desired form. Second, insert the correct wildcard character and code into the category. To do so, proceed as follows.

===  Determining the form's ID

The template variable *{% Form(X) %}* is used to insert a form into a category. Replace the X with the form's ID.

[.instruction]
Determining the form's ID:

.  Go to *System » System settings » CMS » Forms*.
.  Select the form that you want to change from the overview of *FORMS*.
.  The ID is listed in the *ID* line.

===  Inserting the template variable and code

You can use an IF/ELSE query to respond to a form being submitted, e.g. by displaying the words __*Thank you for your message*__. The following is an example code, which contains this message:

[source,xml]

----
<p>
{% if !$ActionPositivResult %}</p>
<h1>
Contact</h1>
<p>
Please get in touch. We will promptly process your inquiry.</p>
<p>
<span>{</span>% Form(X) %}</p>
<p>
{% else %}</p>
<h1>
Thank you for your message.</h1>
<p>
{% endif %}</p>
