== RSS

*RSS* (Really Simple Syndication) is an electronic news format. It enables the user to subscribe to the content of a website in the form of so-called RSS feeds. RSS is a service, similar to a news ticker, providing the headlines with a short excerpt of the text and a link to the original page. For further information about RSS technology, refer to link:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS[Wikipedia^].

RSS feeds can be created with the help of plentymarkets. This way, you can offer the latest items, special offers and revised content pages in the form of RSS feeds (subscriptions) to your store visitors. In addition, RSS feeds are processed well by search engines and the content is analysed.

== Creating an RSS feed

Go to *Setup » CMS » RSS* to create an RSS feed. When accessed, they are updated automatically and remain valid for one hour. After that, they will be updated again the next time that they are accessed.

== Integrating an RSS feed in the website

After an RSS feed has been created in the tab *New RSS feed*, it exists with a static URL. This URL will be displayed in the options of this RSS feed in the tab *RSS feeds*. +
+
An RSS feed can be integrated into a website in two ways. You can either insert a link with the RSS feed's URL as the target, e.g. into a category. Alternatively, you can communicate to the browser that an RSS feed is available for this website. +

In order to directly communicate to the browser that an RSS feed exists for this website, a change has to be made within the page layout of the website.

[.instruction]
Integrating an RSS feed into the website:

. Go to *CMS » Web design*.
. Click on *Layout* on the left and open the *PageDesign* folder. Then click on the *PageDesignContent* template.
. Add the following HTML code at the bottom of the *PageDesignContentMainFrame* editing window. Then change the code's *title* and *URL* to match your online store.
