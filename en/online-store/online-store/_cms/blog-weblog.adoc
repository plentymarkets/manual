|Setting |Explanation

|*Title*
|Enter a title. The title will be displayed as the heading of the blog entry and will be used for creating the URL.  +
*_Note:_* The title is mandatory. If you save your blog entry without having entered a title, your text will be lost.

|*Client (store)*
|Select a client to display the blog entry for this client.  +
The client is a mandatory entry and has to be selected before the language.

|*Language*
|Select the language for the blog entry.  +
The language is a mandatory entry and has to be selected before the category. Languages that can be selected are created under <<omni-channel/online-store/standard/modules/blog-weblog#, Setup » Client » Select client » Modules » Blog>>. Blog entries can also be filtered by language.

|*Category*
|Select a category for the blog entry.  +
The category is mandatory. Blog categories are created under <<omni-channel/online-store/standard/modules/blog-weblog#, Setup » Client » Select client » Modules » Blog>>. +
It is a good idea to set up the categories before creating the blog entry. However, the assignment can also be changed later.

|*Tags*
|Enter keywords for the blog entry. Keywords classify the blog entries. When you search for a keyword, all entries that were tagged with this keyword will be found.

|*Author*
|The system user who logged in will automatically be entered as the author. The author can be changed.

|*Publication*
|Date and time are automatically entered when the blog entry is created. If the blog is to be published later on, do not forget to adjust the date and the time. These will not automatically be updated when the blog is published.

|*Public*
|This option is selected by default when creating a new blog entry. This means that the blog entry will be added to the public blog list as soon as the entry is saved. Remove the check mark if you do not want the blog entry to be published directly. The blog entry will then not be added to the index and can only be found via the blog URL. It is a good idea to initially remove the check mark and look at the blog entry before publication.

|*Translate template variables and template functions*
|Choose between *Yes*, *No* and *Template variables and template functions for links only*. +
*Yes* = All template variables and template functions will be translated. +
*Template variables and template functions for links only* = Only template variables and template functions for links will be translated. +
*No* = No template variables and template functions will be translated.

|*Editor*
|Select an editor for editing the blog entry.

== Blog preview text

The layout template *BlogDesignArchiveList* designs the frame for a list of blog entries. The function *GetBlogDesignBlogArchivesList* displays the elements of the list, i.e. your blog entries with a preview text. If you do not limit the preview text, the complete blog text will be displayed in the preview. In most cases, this is too much text for a preview list.

[NOTE]
.Defining the blog preview text using$PreviewBreak
====
Insert the variable *$PreviewBreak* into your text, e.g. after a full stop or the first paragraph. The text before this variable will be displayed as the preview text (<<image-tab-new-blog>>).
====

== Searching blog entries

The *Edit blog* tab opens automatically when you open the *CMS » Blog* menu. In this tab, all blog entries are displayed sorted by ID. Each blog entry is displayed in its own line. You can delete a blog entry here or open a preview. Moreover you find several filters for searching blog entries in this tab.

[TIP]
.Blog entries and their visibility in the online store
====
When you create a blog entry, it is a good idea to remove the check mark that is set by default next to *Public*. In doing so, you can take a look at the blog entry via the preview and check it once again before publication. The check mark has to be set next to *Public* in order to make a blog entry visible in your online store. You need to have posted at least one blog entry in order for the *Blog* area to be visible in the online store.

== Editing blog entries

When you open a blog entry you will see 2 tabs, *Blog* and *Upload*. You can use these tabs to change a blog entry at any time. This is done by adding or removing content and elements, e.g. adding text, images or files. +
In the *Blog* tab, you can edit the text and save the basic settings for the blog entry. These are the same settings that you carried out while creating a new blog entry (<<table-settings-new-blog-entry>>).

== Tab: Publish blog

This function updates your blogs. In doing so, all blogs will automatically be saved again. Potential problems with the display or errors can be corrected in the process. As such, always carry out the procedure when such problems occur in the blog area.

[NOTE]
.Publishing a blog
====
Click on the *gear-wheel icon* to update the blog.

== Integrating blog entries into the design

Use the function *Link_Blog()* to display the blog entry. The function will then be replaced by a link to the blog entry. You can define the design of the individual blog entries e.g. in the *BlogDesignBlogEntry* template. Use the *BlogDesignPreviewList* template to display a preview list of the blog entries. Insert the function *Link_Blog()* into these templates to generate links to the blog entries. *Link_Blog()* is a global function. You can use it in all templates intended to be used for the blog. If you add a particular blog ID to the function, it can also be used in all the other templates.

=== Creating a preview list of blog entries

Insert the *Link_Blog()* function in combination with other variables and functions into the template *BlogDesignPreviewList*. This generates a list with a link for the number of blog entries as specified in the template's *Settings* tab. The following image shows an example of a preview list for blog entries.

.preview list for blog entries

=== Inserting the link to a specific blog entry

If you want to generate a link to a specific blog entry, e.g. within another blog entry or in a template that does not include the word "blog" in its name, then insert the *Link_Blog()* function with the corresponding ID. The example preview list in <<image-preview-list-one-blog-entry>> only consists of blog entry 16 because the ID 16 was added to the function.
