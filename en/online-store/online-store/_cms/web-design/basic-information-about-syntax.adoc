== Content of this chapter

The following pages provide you with basic information about the structure, coding and syntax of content in your online store. You will learn how various elements are structured and how they can be customized. Most of the structures are already included and configured in the plentymarkets standard design, i.e. the default configuration when you first start your online store. The information on these pages helps you understand and edit these structures. You will need to have a basic understanding of web design to do so. If you are not already familiar with web design, then you should hire an agency to make changes for you.
