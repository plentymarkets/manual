== General information about dimensions

The purchaser has the possibility of entering the length and width in the item layout *$ItemViewSingleItem*, and as such of ordering two-dimensional items with precisely the square millimetre dimensions desired. In doing so, the price will be calculated automatically.

[TIP]

====
The particular item has to be visible in the online store.

== Configuring items for the input of dimensions

The configuration takes place in three steps. These steps are described in further detail below.

=== Creating a free text field

First, create a new free text field. To do so, proceed as follows.

.parameters for the free text field *Dimension input*
image::omni-channel/online-store/setting-up-clients/_cms/web-design/editing-the-web-design/itemview/assets/EN-Web-Design-Edit-Dimensions-01.png[]

[.instruction]
Creating a free text field:

. Go to *Setup » Item » Free text fields*.
. Enter the name *Dimension input* into one of the free text fields.
. Select *Small number (-127 to 127)* under *Data type*.
. Enter the number *1* under *Characters*.
. *Save* the settings.

The steps above will generate a free text field. Later, open up each of the items that the purchaser should be allowed to enter dimensions for and enter a number into the *free text field* (see section 2.3 Entering the number).

[IMPORTANT]
.Entries go into effect the next day
====
The free text field will not be available in the corresponding area for editing items until the next day.
====

=== Entering dimensions

Now, configure the dimensions of the item. These options are necessary for the dimension input.

[.instruction]
Configuring dimensions for an item:

. Open the editing window of an item and click on the *Base* tab. +
→ There you will find the fields *Width*, *Length* and *Height* (<<image-parameters-editing-window-item>>).
. Pay attention to the explanations given in <<table-entering-item-dimensions>> and enter the maximum values for calculating the price as well as for the dimensions of the item. +
→ The example image shows that the unit is *square centimeters* and that the maximum values that can be entered are a width of *500 cm* and a length of *200 cm*.

The following table explains the dimension parameters in an item's *Base* tab:

[[table-entering-item-dimensions]]
.entering the dimensions of items
[cols="1,3"]
|====
|Entry |Explanation

| *Unit*
|Enter the unit. In the example, this is square centimeters. Pay attention to the important note below the table.

| *Content*
|Enter the quantity that the price calculation should be based upon. In the example, this is per 100 square centimeters.

| *Length*
|Enter the maximum length that can be ordered.

| *Width*
|Enter the maximum width that can be ordered.
|====


[WARNING]
.Precision of entries: Only integers accepted!
====
Only whole numbers can be entered into both fields (width and length). Therefore, the unit that you select for the items will determine how precisely the customer can enter measurements. If the unit is square meters, then it would not be possible to order fabric that is 2.5 m wide and 4.3 m long! In this case, the unit would have to be saved as square centimeters and the value for the *content* would have to be adjusted in relation to the *price* that is saved. Then the purchaser could enter the width as 250 and the length as 430. Accordingly, you would have to change the unit to square millimeters if even smaller dimensions are necessary.
====

=== Entering the number

Enter a number into the free text field to determine what will be displayed during the order process in your online store.

[.instruction]
Entering a number for the entry field:

. Click on the *Fields* tab within the area for editing items. +
→ The *Dimensions input* free text field is displayed here (see free text field).
. Enter a *number* into this free text field in order to control the way that the entry field will be displayed in the layout. +
The following definition applies to our example configuration: +
*1:* Only the field for entering the width will be displayed. +
*2:* Only the field for entering the length will be displayed. +
*3:* Both fields will be displayed.
. *Save* the settings.

[TIP]
.Tip
====
Use a group function if you want to *enter the number* for the free text field for several items at once.
====

[IMPORTANT]
.Data exchange
====
Entries for the width, length and height can be imported into the system with the plentymarkets API and the format *ArticleBasicXML*.
====

== Configuring the design for the input of dimensions

Now enter the HTML code into an appropriate location in the *CMS*, e.g. under the code for the *quantity* entry field.

[.instruction]
Entering the HTML code:

. Go to *CMS » Web design » Folder: Layout » Folder: ItemView*.
. Select the *ItemViewSingleItem* template.
. Enter the following HTML code.
. *Save* the settings.

[source,xml]

----
{% if $Free[10]>0 %}

{% if $Free[10]==1 %}

{% endif %}
{% if $Free[10]==2 %}

{% endif %}
{% if $Free[10]==3 %}

{% endif %}
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<th>Width (only)</th>
<td>$InputWidth $InputMeasureUnit <input id="input_length" name="input_length" value="$Length" class="PlentyOrder_InputLength" type="hidden" /></td>
</tr><tr>
<th>Length (only)</th>
<td>$InputLength $InputMeasureUnit <input id="input_width" name="input_width" value="$Width" class="PlentyOrder_InputWidth" type="hidden" /></td>
</tr><tr>
<th>Width</th>
<td>$InputWidth $InputMeasureUnit</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Length</th>
<td>$InputLength $InputMeasureUnit</td>
</tr></tbody>
</table>
{% endif %}

----


[WARNING]
.Replace the number
====
Find each of the *$Free[10]* template variables in the code above and replace the number 10 with the number that your free text field has in your configuration.
====

The following *template variables* are used here. They only exist in the *ItemViewSingleItem* layout:

* *$InputWidth*: Generates the entry form for the width with the CSS class *PlentyOrder_InputWidth*
* *$InputLength*: Generates the entry form for the length with the CSS class *PlentyOrder_InputLength*
* *$InputMeasureUnit*: Provides the unit for the input. The values can be 'm', 'cm' or 'mm' depending on the unit that was defined for the item price (in the example above, the unit for the item price is square centimeters so the$InputMeasureUnitdisplays 'cm').

The template variables *$Width* and *$Length* are also used here. They represent the values entered for the item's *width* and *length*.

If you entered the number 3 into the free text field, then the HTML code would look like this in the browser:

[source,xml]

----
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<th>Width</th>
<td><input class="PlentyOrder_InputWidth" id="input_width" name="input_width" type="text" value="0" /> cm</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Length</th>
<td><input class="PlentyOrder_InputLength" id="input_length" name="input_length" type="text" value="0" /> cm</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

----


This code generates a box in the online store that looks like this:

[[image-entry-field-dimensions]]
.entry field for specifying dimensions in the online store
image::omni-channel/online-store/setting-up-clients/_cms/web-design/editing-the-web-design/itemview/assets/EN-Web-Design-Edit-Dimensions-03.png[]

== Hiding an entry field

[WARNING]
.Important for hidden fields
====
If you only want to use one entry field (only width or only length), then you still have to specify the other dimension so that the *surface areas* and consequently the *prices* can be calculated correctly. Saving the hidden fields as displayed in the following example code will suffice (cf. <<image-entry-field-dimensions>>, code for numbers 1 and 2).
====

For example, if only the *width* should be entered because your product has a fixed length that can not or should not vary, then the length has to be hidden as follows:


[source,xml]

----
<input class="PlentyOrder_InputLength" id="input_length" name="input_length" type="hidden" value="$Length" />

----


[IMPORTANT]
.Function of the variable
====
The template variable *$Length* automatically displays the *length* that was saved in the item data. +
The template variable *$Width* works similarly. In this case, the width is fixed and only the length should be entered.
====
