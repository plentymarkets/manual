==  General information

The order confirmation is the last step of the order process.

==  Order confirmation: Editing the design

This section has already been preconfigured. However, you have a wide range of possibilities for changing it. The newly designed menu makes it easier than ever to carry out the corresponding settings. Furthermore, the newly designed menus give you the option to customize the CSS, among other things. Preconfigured CSS rules are already saved in some of the menus.

You can individually customize the following areas in the *order confirmation* tab:

*Tracking*

The *tracking* submenu contains the fields *head* and *body*. The information that you enter here makes up the head and body area of the order confirmation as well as the head and body area of all order confirmations that are specific to individual payment methods (of the following submenus).

*Order confirmation*

You can select a time for the order confirmation. The customer will automatically be forwarded to the My account area after this amount of time has elapsed. The option is found under *Forwarding to my account*. The value *Never* is selected by default. This means that the customer is only able to access the my account area by clicking on the link to it. You can select the time: *5*, *10* or *20 seconds*.

*Payment methods*

The same three fields are used for all of the following payment methods. These fields are *Text in front of*, *Text behind* and *CSS*. The field *Text in front of* should be used for entering text that you want to have displayed in front of the content of the payment method interface. Similarly, the *text behind* field should be used for entering notes that you want to have displayed behind the content of the payment method interface.

* *Order confirmation*
* *PayPal Express* +
Set *JavaScript* as the forwarding method for *PayPal Express* to ensure correct tracking. To do so, open the *PayPal Express* submenu. Here you will find the *Forwarding method* option.
* *PayPal*
* *Sofortbanking*
* *Moneybookers*
* *Klarna*
* *ClickAndBuy*
* *Paymorrow*
* *iclear*
* *Heidelpay*
* *ExperCash*
* *EOS*
* *Santander Consumer Bank* (formerly CCBank) +
The *Santander Consumer Bank* submenu includes 3 fields that are not found for the other payment methods. These are the fields *seller number*, *link content* and *error text*. Since no interface to the Santander Consumer Bank is initially set up under *Setup » Orders » Payment » Methods*, you have to enter your *seller number* here instead. Enter the link text that you want to have displayed for the order confirmation in the *Link content* field. In the *Error text* field, enter a message that you want customers to see if the payment method is not available. +
For further information, refer to the <<payment/payment-providers/santander-consumer-bank#, Santander Consumer Bank>> page of the manual.

==  Template variables and template functions in the order confirmation

Click on *Template variables and template functions* to access an overview of all the template variables and functions that can be used in this area. If you copy a particular template variable or template function and paste it, e.g. into a note or the CSS, then the corresponding content will be displayed in the order confirmation.

[TIP]
.Tip
====
Template variables such as *$ItemAmountNetDot* are used for displaying numerical values (prices). The last part of the template variable, here dot, indicates the separator that is used, e.g. before the amount of cents. You can use these template variables to customize how prices, shipping costs etc. are displayed in a particular language. For example, you could use a comma as the separator for monetary amounts in a German layout and you could use a period as the separator for an English layout. +
However, if you would like to transmit data, then you have to use the *dot* variable as only these are suitable for the transfer of data.

===  Template variable for order referrer

The template variables *$LastOrderReferrerID* and *$LastOrderReferrerName* have been available since plentymarkets version 4.4. If a customer accesses your online store to e.g. complete their data, because they order something via an external market and this order has the parameter *ReferrerID*, their referrer will have the value from the original ReferrerID. This value is also saved in the template variable$ReferrerID. This referrer will also be used to generate the order. But then, once the order has been placed, the referrer will automatically be set to "Online store" ($ReferrerID= 1). If you would like to know the original referrer (before the order referrer was reset), then$ReferrerIDwill give you the wrong value because it was reset to 1. This is why the template variables *$LastOrderReferrerID* and *$LastOrderReferrerName* are available in the order confirmation templates. They have the value of the referrer from when the order was first placed.

===  List of all template variables in the order confirmation area
