*CMS » Web design » Order process » Shopping cart*

== Content of this page

The shopping cart is the first step of the order process. This area already includes default entries and configurations. However, you can customize this area as desired. The corresponding settings are easy to carry out in the various submenus.

== General information about the configuration

You can individually customize the following areas in the *Shopping cart* tab.

[NOTE]
.Tab: Shopping cart
====
Open the *Shopping cart* tab by going to *CMS » Web design*, clicking on the *Order process* folder and then clicking on *Shopping cart*.
====

[TIP]
.CSS formatting
====
In plentymarkets versions 5.0 and lower, it was possible to save CSS formatting in the individual submenus of the order process. CSS is now saved in the new *CSSOrder* tab. In other words, CSS for the shopping cart can now be customized under *CMS » Web design » Folder: Template » Folder: CSS » Template: CSSOrder*. The CSS formatting is listed there in the same order as the shopping cart submenus.
====

*Title* +
Use this area to design the upper portion of the shopping cart. The customer receives information about the shopping cart and about the order process. An example note is already entered under *Text in front of*. You can edit this text as desired. This first note appears above the *Next button*. This is generally the *Go to checkout* button, which you can customize in the *Buttons* tab. You can change the title and set whether or not the *Next button* should be displayed. If needed, a second note can be saved under *Text behind*. This note will appear at the end of this upper portion of the shopping cart.

*Item* +
A list of items in the shopping cart. Two notes can be entered or edited. The first note is displayed above the list of items and the second one is displayed underneath the list of items, i.e. the information is displayed in the order that you see it here. You can decide which item details should be displayed in the shopping cart, whether customers should be able to directly place items from the shopping cart onto the watchlist and whether the *Update shopping cart* button should be displayed and how it should be positioned.

*Selection of attributes* +
Attributes can only be selected for items that actually have different attributes. The attributes can be selected from drop-down lists, giving the customer a chance to change their mind and choose a different variant. The note that is entered here appears in the customer's shopping cart above these drop-down lists.

*Order characteristic* +
Items can be configured in such a way that it is possible for customers to submit texts and files during the order process. For example, customers could submit a text giving specific details that are relevant to their order. They could also upload a photo that they want to have printed on an item. <<item/managing-items#2, Characteristics>> have to be configured for this.

*Delivery date* +
The link *Change delivery date* is displayed in the shopping cart. The customer can click on this link and enter a delivery date. If a delivery date was already entered, then the customer will see this date here. You can edit the default texts, *Change delivery date* and *Delivery date* as desired. You can also enter a note that will be displayed. Go to *System » System settings » Client » Select client » Order process » Settings* to configure the delivery date for the order process. For further information, refer to the <<omni-channel/online-store/setting-up-clients/order-process#, Basic settings>> page of the manual. This page also includes the code that is inserted into the CMS in order to display the delivery date.

*Subscription* +
This option allows you to offer subscriptions to items in your online store. In order to enable your customers to select the subscription function in the online store, you have to paste the corresponding template variables and template functions into your store's layout. For further information, refer to the <<orders/scheduler#, Scheduler>> page of the manual. In the scheduler area, you can determine the delivery intervals and number of deliveries that your customers should be allowed to choose from in the online store.

*Country of delivery* +
The standard country of delivery is automatically selected. However, by choosing to show this area, you give customers the opportunity to change the selection. If you choose to show this area, then you can decide whether it should be directly visible to customers or only visible once a customer has clicked on the heading of the area.

[NOTE]
.Configure the error message
====
An error message will be displayed if no shipping profile is available for a selected country of delivery. In this case, the customer has to select a different country of delivery or cancel the purchase. Go to *System » System settings » Client » Settings » Languages* to find the error message. You can edit the text of the error message, e.g. if you want to add a note asking the customer to contact the online store. If you made a mistake by not linking this particular country of delivery to a shipping profile, then correct the error and create the corresponding shipping profile as needed.
====

*Payment method* +
Displays the payment methods that can be selected. If any of the payment methods result in additional costs, then these costs will be displayed here. You can set whether the section should first open after clicking on the title. Pay attention to the note about the *Country of delivery* option. This also applies to the payment method.

*Shipping method* +
Displays the shipping methods that can be selected. The shipping method that has the highest priority in your shipping profiles is set by default. You can set whether the section should first open after clicking on the title.

*Totals* +
You can enter a note which will be displayed in the upper left corner of this section.

*Coupon* +
The customer can enter a coupon code in this section. You can set whether or not this section should be displayed. You can also decide whether the section should first open after clicking on the title.

*Footer* +
You can enter notes here. The notes will be displayed in the lower portion of the shopping cart. The first note is saved under *Text in front of*. It is displayed in the shopping cart above the *Go to checkout* (Next) button. You can set whether or not the *Go to checkout button* should be displayed. A second note is saved under *Text behind*. It is displayed in the shopping cart under the *Go to checkout* button.

[TIP]
.Tool for identifying elements
====
We recommend using a tool such as Firebug, which lets you take a look at the elements that you would like to edit. This tool makes it relatively easy to identify elements if you are not exactly sure which name the particular element is assigned to in the code.
====

== Example for customizing a section in the shopping cart

We will now describe the procedure based on the *Title* submenu. You will learn how to edit or hide the elements found within this section.

[TIP]
.Orientation
====
The elements, which we will describe below, are numbered in <<image-shopping-cart-options-submenu-title>>. <<image-shopping-cart-implementation-settings-submenu-title>> shows you how these elements are displayed in the shopping cart. The same numbers are also used here and correspond to the settings made in <<image-shopping-cart-options-submenu-title>>.
====

=== Options for customizing the submenu: Title

<<image-shopping-cart-options-submenu-title>> shows basic settings in this submenu:

[[image-shopping-cart-options-submenu-title]]

|1
|*Image gallery*
|The image gallery contains all of the images for your store's design. You can use the image gallery to load an image into a particular section. Do so by inserting the image's URL. <<image-shopping-cart-options-submenu-title>> shows an example for the HTML code (arrow). Result: <<image-shopping-cart-implementation-settings-submenu-title>> , number 1. +
Create individual folders in the image gallery for the various areas of the design.

*CK-Editor* = An efficient <<omni-channel/online-store/cms#web-design-tools-editor, editor>> that is also used in other areas. +
*Syntax editor* = Code will be highlighted in color in the syntax structure. +
*Text field* = Code will be displayed as pure text.

|4
|*Text in front of*
|The note is used to give the store visitor important information about the order process. Text is already entered by default for some designs and templates. You can edit this text or add to it. It is also possible to save an image by inserting the corresponding HTML code along with the image's URL (<<image-shopping-cart-options-submenu-title>> , arrow).

|5
|*Title*
|The title's name is saved here. In this case, the name is *shopping cart* (<<image-shopping-cart-options-submenu-title>> , number 5).

|6
|*Next button*
|The *Next button* is used to transition from the shopping cart to the order process. To do so, the customer can click on this button or on a second (copy of the same) button at the end of the page. The button is set to *Show* by default (<<image-shopping-cart-options-submenu-title>> , number 6). It can be hidden by selecting *Do not show*. +
*_Tip:_*: You can hide the button by selecting the option *Do not show*. This should be done if you don't want the customer to leave the shopping cart by clicking on the button at the top of the page, but rather to first check the entire page and then click on the button at the bottom of the page. +
You can edit the buttons as well as the text of the buttons in the corresponding tab.

|7
|*Text behind*
|Enter an additional note if needed here, which will be displayed at the bottom of the title field (<<image-shopping-cart-options-submenu-title>> , number 7).
|====

=== The settings displayed in the online store

The position numbers in <<image-shopping-cart-options-submenu-title>> and <<table-options-shopping-cart-submenu-title>> correspond to the position numbers in <<image-shopping-cart-implementation-settings-submenu-title>>. This helps you recognize where the various elements will be displayed in the online store. The elements may look different depending on how the design is customized.

[[image-shopping-cart-implementation-settings-submenu-title]]

== Template variables in the shopping cart area

Click on the icon *Template variables and template functions* to access an overview of all the template variables and functions that can be used in this area (<<image-shopping-cart-options-submenu-title>> , number 2). If you copy a variable or function and paste it, e.g. into a note or the CSS, then the content will be displayed during the checkout process.

[IMPORTANT]
.Example: Template variables and template functions for different separators
====
Template variables such as *$ItemAmountNetDot* are used for displaying numerical values (prices). The last part of the template variable, here dot, indicates the separator that is used, e.g. before the amount of cents. You can use these template variables to customize how prices, shipping costs etc. are displayed in a particular language. For example, you could use a comma as the separator for monetary amounts in a German layout and you could use a period as the separator for an English layout.
====

[WARNING]
.Dot template variables
====
If you would like to use these template variables elsewhere for transmitting data, then you have to use the dot variables as only those are suitable for the transfer of data.
====

The following table explains important template variables for the shopping cart:
