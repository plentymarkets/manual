== CMS editors

A new editor is available starting with plentymarkets version 5.1. Apart from the familiar *editor* (CKEditor) and the conventional *text field*, plentymarkets also provides the new *syntax editor* to edit html content such as item descriptions, templates, categories of the type *content* and email templates. Broadly speaking, the syntax editor is a professional alternative to the *text field* because it not only includes syntax highlighting but also further functions that increase your level of comfort and efficiency when editing HTML.

[IMPORTANT]
.Syntax editor availability
====
Go to *System » System settings » Settings » Editors* if you want to deactivate the syntax editor for specific areas. If the syntax editor is deactivated, then it will not be included in the drop-down list in these areas.

== Who should use the syntax editor and why?

The *syntax editor* is the ideal tool for users who place great value on cleanly structured HTML. The normal <<omni-channel/online-store/setting-up-clients/cms#web-design-tools-editor, editor>> can sometimes cause unintended changes to occur when editing HTML content and inserting template variables and functions. Formatting can occasionally be lost or altered. However, the editor is a good tool to help users generate valid HTML if they do not have in-depth knowledge of HTML structure. The editor is intended to be used in situations where the HTML structure is not especially important or by users who do not have experience with HTML or are not interested in working with complex HTML structures.

Previously, users who valued having their HTML content displayed precisely had no other choice but to work with the *Text field* in plentymarkets 5.0. These were usually agencies, web designers, web developers and users who have in-depth knowledge of HTML. These users can now work with the new syntax editor as well.

== Functions

An overview of the most important functions is listed below. These functions are then explained in further detail on this page.

=== Overview

The syntax editor includes the following features:

* Syntax highlighting
* Simple structure
* Undo and repeat functions
* Search and replace
* Copy / duplicate lines and blocks of code
* Move lines and blocks of code
* Simply hide blocks of code and display them again
* Multi-cursor (simultaneously write in multiple lines)
* Code generation with Emmet
* Many helpful shortcut keys

=== Syntax highlighting

HTML becomes harder to read as you write increasingly more of it. Syntax highlighting helps you find elements easily by displaying tags and attributes in different colours.

=== Structure

It is easier to recognise and edit the code structure when you can indent code with the tab key. It is possible to select several lines and then indent them all simultaneously.

.*indenting* code or *removing the indent*
[cols="1,3"]
|====
|Function |Procedure

|*Indent*
|*Tab* key

|*Remove the indent*
|*Shift* + *tab* key
|====


[TIP]
.Setting: Spaces instead of tabs
====
Click on the *gear-wheel icon* (<<image-syntax-highlighting-editor>> , upper left) and place a check mark if you would like to use *4 spaces* instead of tabs for indentations.
====

=== Undo and repeat functions

Every action can be undone or repeated - even after you have saved the changes.

.*undoing* or *repeating* an action
[cols="1,3"]
|====
|Function |Procedure

|*Undo*
|*Ctrl (cmd)* + *Z*

|*Repeat*
|*Shift* + *Ctrl (cmd)* + *Z*
|====

[IMPORTANT]
.Do not switch the editor
====
This function can only be used if you work exclusively with the *syntax editor*. Saved information and changes will be lost if you switch to a different editor.
====

=== Search

The search function allows you to search for specific text passages. The results are highlighted in color. If a search term does not return any results, then a red frame will be displayed around the search field.

.*search function* in the syntax editor
image::omni-channel/online-store/setting-up-clients/_cms/web-design/tools/assets/EN-CMS-Web-Design-Tools-Syntax-Editor02-SI.png[]

The following table explains the search functions of the syntax editor:

.*search*, *next search result* or *close search*
[cols="1,3"]
|====
|Function |Procedure

|*Search*
|*Ctrl (cmd)* + *F*

|*Next search result*
|Press the *Enter* key or click on the *arrow down* in the search window.

|*Previous search result*
|Press *Shift* + *Enter* or click on the *arrow up* in the search window.

|*Close search*
|*Esc* key or click on the *x* in the search window
|====


=== Search and replace

The syntax editor also includes a replace function. You can search for a specific word, text passage or formatting and replace it with something else. The replace function is found within the search window.

[[image-search-replace-syntax-editor]]
.*searching* and *replacing* with the syntax editor
image::omni-channel/online-store/setting-up-clients/_cms/web-design/tools/assets/EN-CMS-Web-Design-Tools-Syntax-Editor03-SI.png[]

The following table contains an overview of the functions. The last three functions refer to the icons found in the lower right portion of the search window:

.*searching* and *replacing* with the syntax editor
[cols="1,3"]
|====
|Function |Procedure

|*Accessing the replace function*
|*Ctrl (cmd)* + *F* +
Once the search window has opened, press *Ctrl (cmd) + F* a second time.

|*Search for*
|Enter the word, text passage or element that you are searching for.

|*Replace with*
|Enter the word, text passage or element that should replace what was searched for. The example in <<image-search-replace-syntax-editor>> shows that strong formatting was searched for and that it will be replaced with b (= bold).

|*Replace*
|Click on this button to replace the *highlighted element* only.

|*All*
|Click on this button to replace *all elements* on the page.

|*.**
|Search with a link:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression[regular expression^]. This will search for a regular expression. Regular expressions are helpful when searching for and replacing complicated expressions or large quantities of text. They are not suitable for normal usage.

|*Aa*
|Capital and lower case letters will be taken into consideration. Terms will only be found if they have the same capitalisation.

|*\b*
|Entire words will be searched for rather than parts of words.
|====

=== Copying lines and blocks

The current line or the selected lines can either be duplicated or they can be copied and inserted above or below.

.*duplicate*, *insert above* or *insert below*
[cols="1,3"]
|====
|Function |Procedure

|*Duplicate*
|*Shift* + *Ctrl (cmd)* + *D*

|*Insert above*
|*Alt* + *Ctrl (cmd)* + *arrow down*

|*Insert below*
|*Alt* + *Ctrl (cmd)* + *arrow up*
|====

=== Moving lines and blocks

The current line or the selected lines can be moved up or down.

.*moving up* or *moving down*
[cols="1,3"]
|====
|Function |Procedure

|*Move up*
|*Alt* + *arrow up*

|*Move down*
|*Alt* + *arrow down*
|====


=== Hide or display selected text

You can hide text or display it again.

.*hiding* or *displaying text*
[cols="1,3"]
|====
|Function |Procedure

|*Hide text*
|*Shift* + *Ctrl (cmd)* + *7*

|*Display text*
|*Shift* + *Ctrl (cmd)* + *7*
|====


=== Multi-cursor

Text can simultaneously be written, edited or deleted in multiple lines.

=== Emmet plugin

Emmet translates syntax similar to CSS into HTML code. You can use it to quickly generate simple or complex HTML structures. You may need to learn the <<omni-channel/online-store/setting-up-clients/cms#web-design-basic-information-about-syntax, syntax>> first. Users who are familiar with <<omni-channel/online-store/setting-up-clients/cms#web-design-editing-the-web-design-css, CSS>> or <<omni-channel/online-store/setting-up-clients/cms#web-design-basic-information-about-syntax-jquery, jQuery>> should not have any trouble learning Emmet. If you regularly write large quantities of HTML, then it is worthwhile to consider using Emmet.

[NOTE]
.Emmet functionality
====
Enter an Emmet operator directly into the syntax editor and press the *tab* key. The HTML code will be generated.
====

==== Practical examples

The following table shows a few practical examples for how the *Emmet plugin* can be used in the syntax editor:

.practical examples for *Emmet*

|&lt;div&gt; +

&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt; +
&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt; +
&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt; +
&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt; +
&lt;/ul&gt; +
&lt;/div&gt;

|*div&gt;ul#myList&gt;li.myCSSClass$*5*
|&lt;div&gt; +
&lt;ul id="myList"&gt; +
&lt;li class="myCSSClass1"&gt;&lt;/li&gt; +
&lt;li class="myCSSClass2"&gt;&lt;/li&gt; +
&lt;li class="myCSSClass3"&gt;&lt;/li&gt; +
&lt;li class="myCSSClass4"&gt;&lt;/li&gt; +
&lt;li class="myCSSClass5"&gt;&lt;/li&gt; +
&lt;/ul&gt; +
&lt;/div&gt;
