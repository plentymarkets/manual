== CMS editors

Various editors for editing content are integrated in plentymarkets. You can use the *editor* to directly edit text and tables in categories or to apply formatting such as headings, numbering or lists. You see the result immediately when working with this editor (WYSIWYG). You can also edit the content with this editor in the source code. Alternatively, you are also provided with an HTML editor *Text field*. This editor only allows you to work with the HTML code. In addition, the <<omni-channel/online-store/setting-up-clients/cms#web-design-tools-syntax-editor, Syntax editor>> was integrated. With this editor, contents are clearly displayed in a structured way.

[IMPORTANT]
.Select the editor
====
We recommend that you choose one of the editors. When switching the editor, undesired HTML elements may be inserted into your pages or your item descriptions. This effect may occur when e.g. editing a text first with the text field editor and then switching to the CKEditor. If you want to be on the safe side, go to *Setup » Settings » <<basics/working-with-plentymarkets/editor#, Editors>> and deactivate the editor.
====

The editors can be used in the following areas:

* *Item description*
* *Listing description*
* *Categories*
* *Newsletter*

Go to *Setup » Settings » Editors* if you want to deactivate the editor for specific areas. If the editor is deactivated, then it will not be included in the drop-down list in these areas.

=== The editor

The link:http://ckeditor.com/[CKEditor^]{nbsp}icon:external-link[] is used in plentymarkets. It is a widely-used and professional web editor. It allows users to work with a wide range of functions. You can use it to edit *category pages* like you would in a word processing program. No programming and HTML skills are required. However, it is certainly beneficial to have these skills because you can also use this editor to work directly with the source code. You can correct formatting errors in the source code or you can insert formatting that is not available with the editor functions.

For further information about creating and configuring *categories*, refer to the <<item/managing-categories#, Categories>> page of the manual

=== HTML editor

Select *Text area* if you want to work with the HTML editor. The content will then be displayed as HTML code and CSS formatting.

=== System requirements

The operating system does not necessarily influence how well the editor functions. Rather, the web browser influences this.

== Functions

The most important functions are explained below. These are the functions that you will frequently use. Many functions are the same as in word processing programs and do not require additional explanations. Please note that you can point your cursor over a button and see the name of the function.

Some functions may work differently depending on which browser you use. Some functions may also be limited with certain browsers or undesired effects may occur. For example, the formatting may be changed when you insert text into some browsers. Undesired formatting may also be inserted along with the text. This page provides you with tips for working with these functions.

=== Overview of the functions

Below, you will find basic information about the editor's *functions*.
