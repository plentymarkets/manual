== Content of this page

This page provides important and basic information about the page structure in the plentymarkets CMS. An example will be used to illustrate the basic composition of the templates and the page structure.

== Structure overview

The following image illustrates the basic structure of your online store:

[[image-basic-template-structure]]
.basic template structure
image::omni-channel/online-store/setting-up-clients/_cms/web-design/basic-information-about-syntax/assets/EN-CMS-Web-Design-Syntax-Page-Structure01-SI.png[]

The image shows the template structure. You can see how the templates are arranged and which elements belong to each template. This structure is used in several different templates in the plentymarkets CMS. Smaller units are inserted into templates with containers. The template *PageDesignContentMainFrame* is inserted into *PageDesignContentHtmlStructure* with a template variable. The MainFrame template variable is used to insert the *...MainFrame* content into *PageDesignContentMainFrame*.

<<image-template-arrangement-web-design-menu>> shows how the templates are arranged in the *Web design* menu and where the *$MainFrame* template variable is located.

=== PageDesignContentHtmlStructure

A template with the ending *HtmlStructure* contains the entire content of the particular page and gives the page the desired structure. The code for our example is located in the *PageDesign* folder. There it is located in the *PageDesignContent* template and then in the *PageDesignContentHtmlStructure* tab (<<image-template-arrangement-web-design-menu>>). The simplified code looks like this:

[TIP]
.PageDesignContentHtmlStructure
====
$HtmlStartTag +
&lt;head&gt; +
&lt;title&gt;$HtmlMetaTitle&lt;/title&gt; +
$HtmlHeadLinkCSSTags +
$HtmlHeadJavaScriptTags +
$HtmlHeadMetaTags +
&lt;/head&gt; +
&lt;body&gt; +
$PageDesignContentMainFrame

$HtmlBodyOverlays +
&lt;/body&gt; +
&lt;/html&gt;
====

The following table explains the functions of the code elements in this template:

.elements of the tab *PageDesignContentHtmlStructure*
[cols="1,3"]
|====
|Element |Explanation

| *$HtmlStartTag*
|The template variable includes the opening HTML tag and specifies the *DOCTYPE*.

| *$HtmlMetaTitle*
|The *page title* is displayed with this template variable. It is displayed in the title bar and as the tab title in most browsers. The page title is very important for the search function and for the ranking in search engines. Therefore, it should be short and it should be chosen appropriately.

| *$HtmlHeadLinkCSSTags*
|Implements the CSS. The corresponding CSS templates will be implemented here. For example, *CSSBase* and *CSSContent* are used to display categories or items. The order process is displayed with *CSSBase* and *CSSOrder*.

| *$HtmlHeadJavaScriptTags*
|Implements the JavaScript frameworks that are included in plentymarkets by default: jQuery, jQuery UI, jQuery UI Widget, jQuery UI Mouse, jquery.event.drag, jQuery Tools.

| *$HtmlHeadMetaTags*
|This template variable implements meta tags, e.g. *keywords* that are important for search engine indexing.

| *$PageDesignContentMainFrame*
|This template variable inserts the content of the template *PageDesignContentMainFrame*. This template includes the template variable *$MainFrame*. Therefore, this will also be explained below.

| *$HtmlBodyOverlays*
|Overlays are implemented here, e.g. a special layout for the shopping cart.
|====


=== PageDesignContentMainFrame

Most of the content on the sides of the page and in the header is static content. It will neither change its form nor its size and will always be displayed at the same place. This content provides orientation for your customers and allows them to access any desired area of your online store.

A template with the ending *MainFrame* includes the visible content for the particular page. The code for our example is located in the *PageDesign* folder. There it is located in the *PageDesignContent* template (<<image-template-arrangement-web-design-menu>>). The simplified code looks like this:

[TIP]
.PageDesignContentMainFrame
====
&lt;div class="page"&gt; +
&lt;!-- The header and menu can be added here --&gt;

&lt;!-- Main content area --&gt; +
&lt;section class="mainContent"&gt; +
$MainFrame +
&lt;/section&gt; +
&lt;!-- End of the main content area --&gt;

&lt;!-- The footer can be added here --&gt; +
&lt;/div&gt;
====

A complete description of every element would go beyond the reasonable limits of this page. Therefore, we will concentrate on explaining the most important elements only.

The following table includes explanations of the important content in the *PageDesignContentMainFrame* example above.

.elements of the tab *PageDesignContentMainFrame*
[cols="1,3"]
|====
|Element |Explanation

| *$MainFrame*
|Creates the dynamic main content of a page, e.g. a detailed list of items. For further information, refer to the section below.

| *//  txt*
|Comments that are inserted to help users find their way around in the code. These comments will not be displayed. They are used, e.g. to segment iterations in lists.
|====


[IMPORTANT]
.Do not delete important content from the template!
====
The *$MainFrame* template variable is a necessary element of a template and may not be removed. Otherwise the dynamic main content will not be displayed. Comments should not be deleted from the template either.
====

=== Template variable MainFrame

The template variable *$MainFrame* displays the dynamic content, e.g. the detailed view of an item with the template *ItemViewSingleItem* or the *category view* with the template *ItemViewCategoriesList*. The template variable is used in every PageDesign.

.possible content for *MainFrame*
image::omni-channel/online-store/setting-up-clients/_cms/web-design/basic-information-about-syntax/assets/EN-CMS-Web-Design-Syntax-Page-Structure03-SI.png[]

When a visitor clicks on a *category*, for example, the template variable *$MainFrame* will display the template *ItemViewCategoriesList*. When a customer clicks on an item, the detailed view of this item will be displayed with the template *ItemViewSingleItem*.
