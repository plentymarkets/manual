== Multilingualism

In plentymarkets, you can create the order process as well as the store layout and item descriptions in various languages. Even the *Item*, *Content* and *Container* <<item/managing-categories#, categories>> can be created for specific languages. In the *Layout* area, store layouts are created in various languages. Item descriptions are created and saved in various languages within the item's *Texts* tab.

[TIP]
.Tip: Language versions of designs
====
Go to *CMS » Web design* and use the <<omni-channel/online-store/cms/web-design/editing-the-web-design#4-4, Apply design>> icon to copy a design from one particular language into another. In doing so, a design that you use in one language can create templates for several languages. The text will then need to be modified for the new languages. The layout determines the appearance of the *online store*, the *order process* and the *my account* area within the store. For further information, refer to the <<omni-channel/online-store/setting-up-clients/extras/_language#, Language settings>> page of the manual.

[WARNING]
.Setting up completely multilingual online stores and items
====
If you want to set up a multilingual store, make sure to set up all areas, such as the web design (*PageDesign* and all templates), your items and the categories in the desired languages. This is the only way to ensure that your items will be displayed correctly in the second language and that they can also be accessed via the corresponding language URL.
====

== Settings for multiple languages

Here, set which areas in the online store should be available in various languages. For example, the *order process* could be the only area that is available in multiple languages, and not the *design*, the *item* categories and *content* categories or the *items*. The *order process* is already set up for multiple languages in the default setting.

[.instruction]
Setting up language options:

. Go to *System » System settings » Client » Select client » Online store » Multilingualism*.
. Pay attention to the explanations given in <<table-settings-multilingualism>> and carry out the settings as desired.
. *Save* the settings.

The following table explains the settings in the *System » System settings » Client » Select client » Online store » Multilingualism* menu:

[[table-settings-multilingualism]]
.*settings* in the *Multilingualism* menu
[cols="1,3"]
|====
|Setting |Explanation

|*Section*
|Option *Order process* = Only the order process is activated for multilingualism. Option *Items &amp; layout &amp; content pages &amp; order process* = The entire online store is activated for multilingualism.

|*Languages*
|Select the languages for multilingualism.  +
In order to select multiple languages, press *ctrl* (Windows) or *cmd* (Mac) + click with the mouse.

|*Automatic language recognition*
|The automatic language recognition is a function that opens the online store in a specific language, i.e. in the same language as the browser. The configuration in <<image-configuring-multilingualism>> shows that the three languages *German*, *English* and *French* are available for this online store (see arrow). The store's *default language* is *English*. +
As the example in <<image-configuring-multilingualism>> shows, the *browser languages* German, English and French are assigned to the corresponding store languages. This makes it possible for the store to automatically open in the desired language. +
Select a *store language* for all other *browser languages*. The example in <<image-configuring-multilingualism>> shows that *English* is selected for all of the languages that are not available in the system or in the online store. In other words, the online store will automatically be opened in English. +
*Important:* If a *browser language* is not recognised or is not included in the list, then the online store will be opened in the language that was selected for the option *Standard* under *Browser language* (<<image-configuring-multilingualism>>). We recommend using, e.g. the language *English* for this. This language also has to be included in the browser's language settings. For example, in Firefox under *Tools » Options » Content » Languages* (may differ depending on the operating system). +
If no language was selected, then the store will be opened in the system's default language. In the example, this is *English*.

== Creating language versions for categories

Proceed as described below to create a language version for an *Item*, *Content* or *Container* category. Separate language versions will be created for categories. They are made visible by switching the language in the category overview.

.language settings for a *category*
image::omni-channel/online-store/setting-up-clients/assets/EN-Settings-Client-Standard-Store-Multilingualism-02-SI.png[]

[.instruction]
Creating a language version for a category:

. Go to *Item » Categories*.
. Open the category that you want to create a language version for.
. Select the desired language from the *Language* drop-down list, e.g. *English*.
. Enter a name for the page under *Name*.
. Select the desired settings under *Template page*, *Template list*, *Template product* and *Full text search*. → Pay attention to the settings that were saved for the category in the default language.
. Click on the *save icon*. +
*→* The entry will be saved and the path of the page will be created. It is visible in the *URL* line.
. Insert the desired content in the respective language.
. *Save* the settings.

If you now select the corresponding language in the online store, then the language version of the category will be displayed.

[WARNING]
.Important information about subpages
====
The settings for language versions will only go into effect if they were also carried out for their "parent pages": the folder that the page is contained in all the way up to the main level. This means that you need to carry out language settings for the top levels first.
====

[WARNING]
.Requirements for visibility in the online store
====
In order to display the language version of a category in the online store, at least one item has to be saved for the category in the default language and the (default language) category has to have a check mark placed next to it (=activated) under *System » System settings » Client » Select client » Categories » Activate*.
====

== Creating language versions for items

You do not need to create separate item variations in other languages. Rather, create additional language versions within the same item. This content is displayed when the language is opened in the online store.

If you created language versions for items and categories, then you can easily switch the language in the store by selecting a different language. This is assuming that you have created a <<omni-channel/online-store/cms/web-design/editing-the-web-design#4-4, design>> for the respective language.

[.instruction]
Configuring language versions for an item:

. Go to *Item » Edit item*.
. Open the desired *item*.
. Click on the *Texts* tab.
. Select the desired language from the *open language* drop-down list.
. In the field *Name 1*, enter the name (translation) that you want to use for this item in the particular language.
. Enter all of the necessary *texts* (Description, Technical data etc.).
. *Save* the settings. +
→ The language version of the item will be created and will become visible in the online store.

== URL structure of the language versions

The language code will automatically be entered into the language version's *URL*. For example, *en* for English. As such, the language version can be recognised immediately by its URL.

This only holds true for the language versions. The language code will not be displayed in the URL for the store's default language.

.language code in the URL for the *English language version of an item*

That also holds true for the *categories*.

== Flag symbols and language packages

== Language links in the online store

Insert template functions into your layout so that your customers can quickly and easily switch from one language to another. Use the template functions *Link_Lang("DE") %}*, *Link_Lang("EN") %}*, *Link_Lang("FR") %}* etc. Once your online store is ready to be viewed in another language, you will have to insert the template function into the corresponding layout. In the following example, a link to the German store is inserted into the English layout *PageDesignContent*.

=== Text links in the online store

[.instruction]
Linking languages by inserting template functions into the layout:

. Go to *CMS » Web design*.
. In the *Language* drop-down list, select the language of the layout that you want to edit, e.g. *English*.
. Select the layout *PageDesignContent* from the directory tree on the left. +
→ The layout will open in the selected language.
. Insert the *template function* for the desired language into an appropriate place in the layout. For German, this link would be  Link_Lang("DE") %}.
. *Save* the settings. +
→ The link will appear in the English store.

[TIP]
.Examples
====
&lt;a href=" Link_Lang("EN") %}"&gt;English&lt;/a&gt; +
&lt;a href=" Link_Lang("DE") %}"&gt;Deutsch&lt;/a&gt;
====

=== Flag symbols in the online store

Proceed as described below to allow your customers to switch from one language to another by clicking on a flag symbol in your online store instead of a text link. The procedure is similar to the one used for inserting text links. Essentially, you only have to specify the image's URL instead of the text.

[.instruction]
Inserting flag symbols into the design:

. Go to *CMS » Webspace*.
. Then select *layout » your current layout » images*.
. Click on the *upload files* icon and find where you saved the flag symbols on your computer.
. Select the desired flag images and click on *open*. (As an alternative, you can also drag &amp; drop the images into the folder.) +
→ The images will be uploaded.
. Open an image, e.g. the German flag.
. Write down the image's URL, e.g. /layout/stonepattern/images/German_Flag.png. The URL is composed of the path shown in the drop-down list in the upper left corner and the image name with its ending.
. Go to *CMS » Web design*.
. In the *Language* drop-down list, select the language of the layout that you want to edit, e.g. English.
. Select the layout *PageDesignContent* from the directory tree. +
→ The layout will open in the selected language.
. Insert the *template function* and *image path* for the desired language into an appropriate place in the layout. For German, this link would be *Link_Lang("DE") %}*.
. *Save* the settings. +
→ The flag will appear in the English version of the online store.

[TIP]
.Example
====
&lt;a href=" Link_Lang("DE") %}&gt;German&lt;img src="/layout/stonepattern/images/German_Flag.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
====
