.The new *Ceres* online store
====
As of now, online store projects are based on the new online store plugin  <<omni-channel/online-store/setting-up-ceres#, Ceres>>. The *Ceres* store uses the latest and future-proof <<plugins#, plugin technology>>. Ceres can be customised easily and extended by additional plugins from the link:https://marketplace.plentymarkets.com/en/[plentyMarketplace^]{nbsp}icon:external-link[].

Online stores that have been created on the basis of the old CMS will be maintained during the transition period. However, no new features will be developed for the old CMS. We recommend to use the new *Ceres* online store for all future online store projects.

== Creating a multilingual online store

Setting up a multilingual online store requires you to carry out several different steps in various menus of your plentymarkets system. These steps are explained here systematically. The different sections of this page correspond to the settings that need to be carried out in order to set up a multilingual online store. You are free to carry out these steps in a different order. However, make sure that you carry out all of the steps.

== Your system's default language

Every plentymarkets system is given a default language when it is installed. This language will be selected by default in all of the areas of your system where information can be saved in multiple languages. This includes the areas for editing the *web design*, *categories* and *items*.

After having saved information in another language, the system will return back to its default language. This means that you will need to reselect the language that you were just working with if you decide to change some of the information.

== Transferring the design to another language

You can copy your online store's design in the default language and apply this design to a different language. This is done in the *CMS* menu. Since the default language's design is copied, you will only need to make changes to the text in the target language.

[[image-applying-design]]
.applying a design

[.instruction]
Applying a design:

. Go to *CMS » Web design*.
. Click on *Apply design* (<<image-applying-design>>).
. Use the *Source* drop-down list to select which design and *language* the characteristics should be transferred from.
. Use the *Destination* drop-down list to select which design and *language* the characteristics should be applied to.
. Select which areas should be transferred from the source to the destination (place check marks).
. Click on *Apply design*.

In doing so, a design that you use in one language can create *templates* for several languages. The text will then need to be modified for the new languages. Now the second language's design is exactly the same as the first language's design.

[NOTE]
.Editing the layout
====
You can make changes directly to the individual language versions of the template by going to *CMS » Web design » Layout*. Select the desired language from the upper menu bar and then select the layout that you want to edit from the directory on the left.
====

== Activating other languages

You can select multiple languages for your online store and decide whether you want the entire store or only the order process to be multilingual. You may decide that you would rather copy or activate the design and its languages at a later time, e.g. once you have finished creating items and categories for this language. But if you choose to activate the languages at the very beginning, then you will be able to check your progress in the online store after having made changes.

.activating languages
image::omni-channel/online-store/setting-up-clients/assets/EN-Settings-Client-Best-Practice-Multilingual-Store-02-SI.png[]

[.instruction]
Activating other languages for the online store:

. Go to *Setup » Client » Select client » Online store » Multilingualism*.
. Mark all of the *languages* that you want to activate (multiple selection using Ctrl or CMD + mouse click).
. Use the *Section* drop-down list to decide how much of the store should be multilingual. The setting *Items &amp; layout &amp; content pages &amp; order process* will make the entire online store multilingual. The *Order process* setting will only make the order process multilingual.
. *Save* the settings. +
→ Your online store is now available in multiple languages.

You can make sure that this is true by entering your store's URL into a browser and then adding on the ISO code for the languages that you just created e.g. __*www.NAME_OF_YOUR_SHOP.com/de/*__ for German or __*www.NAME_OF_YOUR_SHOP.com/fr/*__ for French.

If you were to select your online store's default language, e.g. along with the *order process*, then this would have no effect on the default language. In such a case, the online store would remain completely available in this language.

== Multilingual categories

This section explains how to create multilingual categories of the types *Content*, *Item* and *Container*. This is assuming that you have already created categories in one language (your online store's default language). +
+
There are two different ways to edit categories. You can either use the multilingual editor or the monolingual editor. The multilingual editor makes it possible to edit a content page in two different languages at the same time. In other words, to see the content in one language (e.g. the default language) while editing another language.

[WARNING]
.Visibility in the menu Item » Categories
====
In order for a category to appear within the directory tree in the *Item » Categories* menu, you must have already created this category in your system's default language. In other words, you must have at least entered a *page name* in the default language.
====

=== Monolingual editor

Proceed as described below to create a language version of an existing category.

The homepage is now available in German. You can open the German homepage and take a look at the result, e.g. under __*www.NAME_OF_YOUR_SHOP.com/de/*__.

== Creating language versions of an item

Your system's default language plays a very important role here as well. This is because the items will only be displayed in the default language when listed in the overview of items. Furthermore, you will not be able to activate an item in the online store if it doesn't already exist in your system's default language. This means that every item always has to be created in the default language before it is translated into the other languages.

[.instruction]
Creating language versions of an item:

. Click on the *texts* tab.
. Select the desired language from the *open language* drop-down list.
. In the field *Name 1*, enter the name (translation) that you want to use for this item in the particular language.
. Enter all of the necessary *texts* (Description, Technical data etc.).
. *Save* the settings. +
→ The language version of the item will be created and will become visible in the online store.

If the item is not visible in the online store, then click on the *Available* tab and check whether the item was set to *visible* for the online store. Also check whether you *activated* the *category* that contains the item. These settings will go into effect for all of the languages versions that were created for a category or an item.

If you haven't linked the item to a category yet, then you can do so in the item's *categories* tab. For further information about linking items to categories, refer to the <<item/managing-items#300, Categories>> page of the manual.

== Creating language versions of an email template

All emails that are sent with plentymarkets are based on *Email templates*. Go to *Setup » Client » Select client » Email » Templates* to configure email templates. You can read and change the email templates there as well as create new templates. A plentymarkets system comes equipped with a variety of pre-configured email templates. Your customer will receive the language version of the email template that corresponds to the language they used to access the online store.

For further information about the different *template functions and variables* that you can use in the email templates, refer to the <<crm/sending-emails#1200, Templates>> page of the manual.

Create event procedures to automatically send your email templates when specific events occur. For further information about automatically sending emails, refer to the <<crm/sending-emails#700, Automatic email>> and the <<automation/event-procedures#, Event procedures>> pages of the manual.

== Creating language versions of a PDF document

Not only can the online store be displayed in multiple languages, but you can also create multilingual templates so that documents such as invoices, delivery notes, credit notes, etc are displayed to customers in the correct language.

[.instruction]
Creating language versions of an existing document template:

. Select the desired document.
. In the *language field*, select the desired language for the document.
. Carry out all of the settings as desired.
. *Save* the settings. +
→ The *language version* of the document template will be created.

Alternatively, you can copy the settings that were saved for a different language and/or document template and then edit them afterwards. This is useful if you already have a document template that was completely set up in one language. It ensures that the template will be set up the same way for the next language. For further information about these documents and their settings, refer to the <<orders/order-documents#, Documents>> page of the manual.

== Linking languages by inserting template functions into the design

Insert template functions into your layout so that your customers can quickly and easily switch from one language to another. Use the template functions *Link_Lang("DE") %}*, *Link_Lang("EN") %}*, *Link_Lang("FR") %}* etc. Once your online store is ready to be viewed in another language, you will have to insert the template function into the corresponding layout. In the following example, a link to the German store is inserted into the English layout *PageDesignContent*.

[.instruction]
Linking languages by inserting template functions into the layout:

. Go to *CMS » Web design*.
. In the *Language* drop-down list, select the language of the layout that you want to edit, e.g. *English*.
. Select the layout *PageDesignContent* from the directory tree on the left. +
→ The layout will open in the selected language.
. Insert the *template function* for the desired language into an appropriate place in the layout. For German, this link would be  Link_Lang("DE") %}.
. *Save* the settings. +
→ The link will appear in the English store. (<<image-langage-link-online-store>>)
