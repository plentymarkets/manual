.The new *Ceres* online store
====
As of now, online store projects are based on the new online store plugin  <<omni-channel/online-store/setting-up-ceres#, Ceres>>. The *Ceres* store uses the latest and future-proof <<basics/first-steps/plugins#, plugin technology>>. Ceres can be customised easily and extended by additional plugins from the link:https://marketplace.plentymarkets.com/en/[plentyMarketplace^].

Online stores that have been created on the basis of the old CMS will be maintained during the transition period. However, no new features will be developed for the old CMS. We recommend to use the new *Ceres* online store for all future online store projects.

== Item link cloud

A link cloud is an arrangement of links to different items. These links have different font sizes and are sorted randomly. The font size of a link is assigned automatically based on the number of search results. As such, an item with many search results is displayed in large font. You save the search tags and links for inserting a link cloud into your online store in the *System » System settings » Client » Select client » Modules » Link cloud* menu. Proceed as described below to create link cloud for your items.

== Defining search tags

First define the search tags, i.e. the terms that items are linked to and that the items can be found under. Usually the names of items or categories are used as search tags. You can also select search tags that do not reflect the item names directly. For example, enter *glasses* as a search tag to list items with different names. The tag *glasses* will list all glasses that you have in stock. Note that you might have to spell items with a hyphen. For example, the item *sunglasses* will not be found. However, it is found if spelled with a hyphen, as *sun-glasses*.

[.instruction]
Defining search tags:

. Go to *System » System settings » Client » Select client » Modules » Link cloud*.
. Enter one search tag per line.
. *Save* the setting. +
&amp;rarr; A link to the search results is created automatically.
. Click on the magnifying glass to display the number of the search results.

[IMPORTANT]
.Updating a link cloud
====
The link cloud is not automatically updated when your items change. You need to resave your settings to update the link cloud.
====

== Inserting the link cloud in your online store

Now insert the contents of your link cloud into your online store. Open the CMS menu and insert a headline and a box in the *PageDesignContentMainFrame* template. The template variable for displaying the link cloud is *$ItemLinkCloud*. Below you will find an example code that you can insert into your web design and modify according to your needs.

[TIP]
.Tip: Font sizes
====
The differences in font sizes are calculated with the help of a specific mechanism. The font sizes differ most if you use as many links as possible with a variety of search results.
