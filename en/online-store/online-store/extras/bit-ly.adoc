== Example of use

This service for shortening URLs is e.g. used for automatic tweets that are generated via the <<omni-channel/online-store/setting-up-clients/extras/live-shopping#100, Procedure manager>>. In this case, the URLs of the category pages will automatically be shortened, e.g. for the *Tweet live shopping offers* procedure. This way, more characters will be left for the rest of the message.
