==  General information

The family card Hesse was introduced by the government of Hesse in collaboration with partners from the field of economics and other institutions. It is an additional building block towards creating a modern family policy, which deals with the needs of families. In the form of a check card, families in Hesse have been able to use this card since September 11th, 2010 in order to receive a variety of discounts and support in several areas. Further information (in German) can be found here: link:http://www.familienkarte.hessen.de/dynasite.cfm?dsmid=14502[www.familienkarte.hessen.de^].

==  Inserting the template variable and CSS code

Before your customers can select the option *family card Hesse* in the online store, you have to insert the template variable *$FamilienKarteLogin* into your design. Select an appropriate spot, e.g. under the *login* area. Insert the template variable and CSS code into your design as described below.

<!--  End Box Login -->
{% if $CustomerID %} <br /> $FamilienKarteLogin <br /> {% endif %}
<!--  Box Familienkarte -->

.Visibility of the family card box in the online store

The code includes an *if-query*, which ensures that the family card box will only be displayed when the customer has logged into your online store. The box's other elements are the default store's CSS codes.

==  Visibility and login

The family card Hesse login box is only visible once the respective customer has logged into the online store.

During the first successful login, the system will save the family card access data. Afterwards, as soon as the customer in question has logged into the online store, the login with their family card access data will take place automatically.
