== Facebook

*Facebook* is a social networking website with more than 845 million active users. In 2009, a study ranked Facebook as the *most used social networking service* by worldwide monthly active users (Wikipedia). Facebook also allows developers to make their own websites more social with the help of "Facebook Connect". One of the most commonly used features for doing so is the comment function (http://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/198/). For example, users can configure their own Facebook app (e.g. for the online store) and then use this menu to connect the app with plentymarkets.

[TIP]
.Tip: Facebook app
====
If you haven't created your own *Facebook app* yet and you need *information* about doing so, then you can find instructions on link:http://developers.facebook.com/docs/appsonfacebook/tutorial/[http://developers.facebook.com/docs/appsonfacebook/tutorial/^]. +
Further instructions for *integrating* a *Facebook app* into your account are found in online tutorials, blogs and literature. Creating an app takes a good deal of skill and knowledge. You may need to learn about this topic beforehand or have a service provider create an app for you. +
One example of a *Facebook app* is a *sweepstakes*. You can search online to find a wide range of instructions about creating and integrating a sweepstakes app.
