== Language packages

The language packages contain the terms and texts that are used by the system. These are default texts that are automatically inserted into the corresponding area e.g. *select category* or *add to shopping cart*.

== Editing texts in language packages

In this menu, you have the possibility of customising the texts that the system uses in the order process as well as in the my account area. You can make changes to the default translations if you would like to use other terms or rearrange the phrasing.
