==  General information about Elm@r

*Elm@r* (electronic market) is a data standard which was developed in a research project at the University of Mannheim. Since plentymarkets makes use of this standard, item data can easily and automatically be embedded in various product search engines.

==  Setup

Modifications have to be made in two areas. On the one hand, first level categories have to be linked to the Elm@r categories. On the other hand, general information about the store and its owner have to be saved.

===  Linking categories

Category links are carried out for each category in the *Items » Categories » Tab: Settings* menu.

===  Generating the shop file

All of the information that was given in the *System » System settings » Client » Select client » Services » Elmar* menu is necessary for generating an XML file. This shop file will be analyzed by Elm@r and its content will be forwarded to product search engines. This file has the name shopinfo.xml and can be accessed via the shop's URL, e.g. http://www.my-shop.com/shopinfo.xml

The shop file will be automatically updated once a day. If changes are made in the *System » System settings » Markets » Price analysis » Exports* menu, then the update will take place directly.

After all information has been entered, the store still has to be registered with link:http://www.elektronischer-markt.de/[Elm@r^]. The *shop file's URL* is necessary for doing so.
