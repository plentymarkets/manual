== Treepodia

You can use link:http://www.treepodia.de/index.html[Treepodia^] to equip each of your items with a *video* without any preproduction costs. The Treepodia interface offers you the possibility to *automatically create product videos* from item images and to integrate them in the SingleArticle layout of store items. The Treepodia service also includes generating a *video sitemap*, which helps you to get better SEO effects in Google. The effectiveness of the product videos in terms of higher conversion rates can be measured on the basis of daily updated data. +
Different packages can be booked depending on the size of your shop. Size is measured in terms of *visitors per month* and the *number of different items in the catalog*.

== Setting up Treepodia

Please read the information in section 2.1 before setting up the interface in plentymarkets.

=== Closing a contract with Treepodia

You need a *store UUID* in order to set up Treepodia in your plentymarkets system. You will receive this from Treepodia when you *close a contract* with them. Get in contact with Treepodia and close a contract with them. The following link:http://www.treepodia.co.uk/pricing.html[link^] contains pricing information and gives you the possibility to directly register for the Treepodia service.

[WARNING]
.Contract
====
A separate contract has to be closed for each *client (store)*.
====

=== Adding text to videos

There are two possibilities to add text to Treepodia videos.

==== Global slogans

Global slogans are one possibility. If you do not yet - especially at the beginning - have enough individual video text on the item level, then you can use global store slogans. These are general pieces of information about your store and they do not apply to a specific item. For example, "guaranteed quality" or similar (<<image-treepodia-slogans>>). +
If there are not enough individual video texts that have been selected or set up in free text fields, then the global shop slogans will be included in the videos.

==== Setting up free text fields

You can use *free text fields* to create individual texts for your videos. +
If you have entered a short description that is suitable for using in a video, then you can select the corresponding free text field (<<image-treepodia-settings>>).

Create up to 4 *free text fields* and save a *name* for each of them, e.g. Treepodia 1, Treepodia 2 etc. Go to the area for editing items and click on the *Fields* tab. Enter a *slogan* for each item for Treepodia into the desired free text fields. This can be a feature for all items, e.g. a *guarantee period*, or a feature for a specific batch of items, e.g. a *pivoting display* for digital cameras.

[WARNING]
.Activation
====
Please note that free text fields are activated over night and therefore will only be available the next day.
====

[TIP]
.Tip: Group functions
====
If you want to configure many items for Treepodia, you can enter the slogans with the help of a *group function* for all items, selected items or specific batches of items. For the group function you can, for example, also select the items by means of their *flag*.

*Caution:* Please make sure that the button you are using complies with current legal regulations in your country. In Germany e.g. the button *text* of the *place order button* has to be formulated in such a way that it becomes clear that the customer has to *pay*. This means that *place order* is not specific enough. The law requires a formulation that could be literally translated as *Order with liability to pay* or something similar in meaning. The German standard button text in plentymarkets has been changed accordingly. *Make sure that you stay up-to-date on this topic and ask a legal adviser if you have any questions.* +
*Tip:* Information about this *bill* can be found link:http://www.bundestag.de/dokumente/textarchiv/2012/37424023_kw03_pa_recht_verbraucherschutz/index.html[here^] (in German). +

Treepodia and the customers come to an agreement about the polling time.
