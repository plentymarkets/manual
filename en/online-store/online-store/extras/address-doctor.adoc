You can use the following CSS example. However, you should be sure to make changes to it as needed so that it matches the configuration of your online store. The example provides you with a good starting point.

==  Address validation

You can either use this function to validate your customers' addresses while they are being entered or once the customer has saved their data. You must have set up and activated the *AddressDoctor* interface in order for addresses to be validated. Detailed information about AdressDoctor and about the prices for validating addresses can be found directly on the link:http://www.addressdoctor.com/en/adress-management-loesungen/online-shops-e-commerce/online-shops-e-commerce.html[AddressDoctor^] website.

==  Address validation settings

In this menu, you can specify which address should be validated and when this validation should take place.

.*address validation* settings
image::omni-channel/online-store/setting-up-clients/extras/assets/EN-Settings-Client-Standard-External-Services-AddressDoc-02-.png[]

[.instruction]
Setting up the address validation:

.  Go to *System » System settings » Client » Select client » Services » Addressdoctor » Address validation*.
.  Click on the desired tab to select the section that you would like to check.
.  Pay attention to the explanations given in <<table-address-validation-settings>> and carry out the settings as desired.
.  *Save* the settings. +
→ You can set up the validation of other addresses afterwards. To do this, proceed in the same manner.

The following table explains the settings in the *Address validation* submenu:

[[table-address-validation-settings]]
.*address validation* settings
[cols="1,3"]
|====
| Setting | Explanation

|*Address validation when saving*
| Select which service provider should validate the address. Currently, there is only an interface to AddressDoctor. This option validates the customer's address once it has been saved.

|*Address validation when entering text*
| Select which service provider should validate the address. Currently, there is only an interface to AddressDoctor. This option validates the customer's address while it is being entered. +
*Important*: Only select one type of address validation. Either select *Address validation when entering text* or *Address validation when saving*.

|*Force address validation*
| Enter the time period in days after which you want the address validation to be repeated. The address will automatically be validated again once the saved time period has ended. This will be done even if the address was not saved or entered a second time. +
*Tip*: Select a time period that will allow the address to be validated before the first shipment is made. This will ensure that incorrect information or changes are recognized in a timely manner and can still be corrected if necessary.
