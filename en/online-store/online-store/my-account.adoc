[IMPORTANT]
.The new *Ceres* online store
====
As of now, online store projects are based on the new online store plugin  <<omni-channel/online-store/setting-up-ceres#, Ceres>>. The *Ceres* store uses the latest and future-proof <<plugins#, plugin technology>>. Ceres can be customised easily and extended by additional plugins from the link:https://marketplace.plentymarkets.com/en/[plentyMarketplace^]{nbsp}icon:external-link[].

Online stores that have been created on the basis of the old CMS will be maintained during the transition period. However, no new features will be developed for the old CMS. We recommend to use the new *Ceres* online store for all future online store projects.
