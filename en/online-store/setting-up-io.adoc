==Setting up IO in plentymarkets

In order to set up a Ceres online store, the plugins Ceres and IO need to be saved and deployed in a <<plugins#20, plugin set>>.
Furthermore, the plugin IO needs to be assigned the highest position number in the plugin set via the *Set position* action in the *Plugins » Plugin overview* menu.

[WARNING]
.Old online store will be unavailable
====
When deploying the online store plugins *Ceres* and *IO* in <<plugins#70, plugin set>>, the old plentymarkets online store Callisto will be unavailable. *Ceres* and *IO* will use the URL of the online store.
====

After these preparations, go to *Plugins » Plugin overview* and click on the plugin *IO*.

|Setting |Explanation

2+|*Template*

|*Namespace of the used template plugin*
|Enter the name of the template plugin you are using. This is *Ceres* in almost every case. Users who want to replace Ceres with a completely different template plugin need to the enter its name in this field, so that IO can properly interact with the plugin. This setting is directed at advanced users only. If you enter a different name while still using the *Ceres* template plugin, it is likely that issues will arise in the online store.

2+|*Number formats*

|*Number of decimal places*
|Enter the number of decimal places to be used in the online store. The default number of decimal places is two.

|*Decimal separator*
|Enter the decimal separator you want to use in the online store. The default decimal separator is the comma.

|*Thousands separator*
|Enter the thousands separator you want to use in the online store. The defaul thousands separator is the period.

|*Use customer-specific price format*
|Select if prices are to be displayed in the respective price formats of your online store customers.

2+|*Routing*

|*Enable routes*
|Activate the routes used in Ceres. All routes need to be active for using the unmodified version of *Ceres*. If you want to implement the *Ceres checkout* in your Callisto online store, several routes have to be deactivated. Please refer to our <<omni-channel/online-store/best-practices#checkout, Best Practice>> for further information.
