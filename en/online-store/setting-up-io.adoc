|Setting |Explanation

2+| *Template*

| *Namespace of the used template plugin*
|Enter the name of the template plugin you are using. This is *Ceres* in almost every case. Users who want to replace Ceres with a completely different template plugin need to the enter its name in this field, so that IO can properly interact with the plugin. This setting is directed at advanced users only. If you enter a different name while still using the *Ceres* template plugin, it is likely that issues will arise in plentyShop.

2+| *Number formats*

| *Number of decimal places*
|Enter the number of decimal places to be used in plentyShop. The default number of decimal places is two.

| *Decimal separator*
|Enter the decimal separator you want to use in plentyShop. The default decimal separator is the comma.

| *Thousands separator*
|Enter the thousands separator you want to use in plentyShop. The defaul thousands separator is the period.

| *Use customer-specific price format*
|Select if prices are to be displayed in the respective price formats of your plentyShop customers.

2+| *Routing*

| *Enable routes*
|Activate the routes used in Ceres. All routes need to be active for using the unmodified version of *Ceres*.
