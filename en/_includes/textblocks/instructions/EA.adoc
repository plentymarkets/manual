*_Note:_* The data is not transferred in real time when the event procedure is triggered. Instead, the data is registered in a queue. As such, transferring the data can take up to several minutes if a large number of jobs need to processed. On the plus side, this means that several retries will be performed if the target server is throttled or not responding.
