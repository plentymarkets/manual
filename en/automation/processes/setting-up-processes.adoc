== Processes in plentymarkets

Processes allow you to automate many complex tasks in plentymarkets. Find out more about automatically processing orders in our link::https://www.plentymarkets.co.uk/knowledge/video-tutorials/automation/[video tutorials on automation].


The following process elements are available:

* Work steps
* Control elements
* Procedures
* Sub-procedures

[#20]
=== What is a work step?

Each process consists of at least one work step. Work steps are the core of your processes. Work steps are used to define which tasks and sequences are to be automated. Depending on the type of work step, you automate processing of either individual or several orders or of incoming items. You can add an unlimited amount of work steps to each process. The following types of work steps are available:

.Available work steps
[cols="1,3"]
|====
|Work step |Explanation

|**Order group processing work step**
|Specifies which and how many orders should be processed. Filters allow you to limit automatic processing to specific orders. Furthermore, you can specify if and to what extent the work step makes any changes these orders. You can change the status, the owner and/or the flag of orders that were processed in this work step. You also specify the sequence in which orders are processed.

|**Order processing**
|Defines how single orders are dealt with after they are registered, e.g. scanned with a barcode scanner.

|**Incoming items**
|Use the work step to search for and register single incoming items, to search for orders and then book the items contained in the order and to automatically assign reorders.
|====

[#30]
=== What is a procedure?

Procedures are added to a work step. Use procedures to specify which actions are to be performed automatically when a process is run.

For further information about available procedures, refer to the <<automation/processes/procedures#, Procedures/control elements>> page of the manual.

[#40]
=== What is a control element?

Control elements are a special type of procedure. Control elements are used to control how the work steps of a process are executed. As such, you add control elements to a work space to control the way that the procedures of the work step interact with each other. For example, you can repeat procedures, jump to specific points within the work step or specify conditions that need to be met before a procedure is executed.

The following control elements are available and are described in more detail on the <<automation/processes/procedures#_control_elements, Procedures/control elements>> page of the manual.

.Available control elements

[#50]
=== What is a sub-procedure?

Sub-procedures are added to a procedure. As such, you use sub-procedures to specify which actions are to be performed automatically when a procedure is run.

For a list of available sub-procedures, refer to the <<automation/processes/sub-procedures#, Sub-procedures>> page of the manual.

=== Creating a work step

The following work steps are available:

* Order group processing
* Single order processing
* Incoming items

[#80]
==== Creating a work step “Order group processing”

Proceed as described below to create a work step of the type *Order group processing*.

[.instruction]
Creating a work step “Order group processing”:

. Go to *System » Processes » Select folder » Select process*.
. Click on *New work step*. +
→ The window *New work step* opens.
. From the drop-down list select the type *Order group processing*.

=== Managing error handling

It is possible to fix errors so that processes are not aborted due to one or more faulty orders. To do so, you can add one of the combinations of procedures and sub-procedures to certain procedures. These procedures are only run if an error occurs. For example, if you add the troubleshooting procedure *Order* with the two sub-procedures *Change status* and *Add order notes* to a procedure, faulty orders are assigned a new status. In addition, a note is added to the order.

[#160]
==== Available procedures in case of error
