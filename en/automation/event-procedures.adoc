Order processing mostly consists of routine tasks. To a large extent, you can let your plentymarkets system take care of these tasks. In particular, sending emails to your customer is a time-consuming tasks, but nonetheless a vital aspect of a service- and customer-oriented online store.
With the *Event procedures*, plentymarkets provides you with an efficient tool for setting up such automatic processes that are reliably managed by your plentymarkets system.
The basic principle of event procedures is simple: Certain *Events* that occur in the online store trigger specific *Procedures*.

[TIP]
.Example: Sending order confirmations
====
To automatically send an order confirmation to the customer as soon as a new order is placed, you can create an event procedure in which the Event *New order* is followed by the procedure *Send email*. With the help of the *Filter* function, you can define for which of the new orders emails should be sent.
====

Creating an event procedure always consists of the following steps:

. <<#100, Creating an event procedure>>
. <<#110, Selecting an event>>
. <<#120, Adding one or multiple filters>>
. Determining which <<#130, Procedures>> should be carried out by the system once the selected event takes place
. <<#200, Activating>> the event procedure

For practical examples of how to use event procedures effectively, refer to the <<automation/best-practices-automation#, Best Practices: Procedure manager and event procedures>> page of the manual.
