In this chapter, you will be given detailed information about the different options for editing warehouses.
You will learn how to create a new warehouse that replicates your real-life warehouse 1:1 in your plentymarkets system.
Furthermore, you will learn how to set up box storage racks that can be used as interim storage for multi order picking.

You have the ability to replicate your warehouse 1:1 in your plentymarkets system. However, this may require some planning on your side.

* Effectively setting up your warehouse is a crucial step for a well-functioning shipping process and can help save you a lot of time.
So take some time to get to know the settings and to think of optimal picking routes when replicating your warehouse.
* Every storage location should be given a **label** with a barcode. This will ensure that you are able to make use of the **<<basics/automation/plentymarkets-client#, plentymarkets Client>>** tool.

== Planning a warehouse

[IMPORTANT]
.Set up at least one warehouse
====
You need to set up at least one warehouse before you will be able to register stock and to book incoming items later on. Incoming orders will be assigned to a warehouse depending on the item availability.
====

You are provided with various units for arranging your warehouse. Below, you can see a list that starts with the largest unit and then continues with progressively smaller and more detailed units:

.Dividing a warehouse into units
[cols="a,a"]
|====
|Unit
|Explanation

|**Warehouse**
|The entire warehouse

|**Zone**
|The warehouse is divided into different zones. Store items that are not ordered very often or seasonal items, in the zone that is the farthest away from your packing zone. In image 1 zone 3 is farthest away. If no items have to be retrieved or stored in this zone, then it can be omitted from the route through the warehouse. Items that are needed on a regular basis should be located in the zone closest to the packing table.

|**Rack**
|Each zone is comprised of one or more racks. For example, every zone in the illustration is comprised of four different racks (image 1, bottom).

|**Level**
|Every rack is comprised of one or more levels.

|**Shelf**
|Each level is comprised of one or more shelves, depending on how your rack is structured. For example, the rack in the illustration is composed of two shelves per level (image 1, bottom).

|**Storage location**
|Your items are stored at specific storage locations. Every shelf has space for one or more storage locations. For example, each shelf in the illustration is composed of three storage locations (image 1, bottom).
|====

The parameters listed below are used in the given order to create a pick list that follows an optimal route through your warehouse:

* Rack position
* Position of the storage location +
→ starting with the lowest position

You first need to define the number of zones that you divide your warehouse in. A warehouse can be divided into up to 20 zones

You can change the route that is taken through the warehouse without changing any name. You only need to change the positions.

Image 1 shows an example for planning an optimal route through a warehouse. However, you can arrange your warehouse differently.
A rack consists of several shelves. These shelves can be next to each other as well as above one another.
Assign levels to shelves to indicate that they lie above one another.
The upper part of image 1 shows a plan view of a warehouse so you can only see one level.
Further levels would result in additional shelves and storage locations (image 1, bottom).
The name of a rack and the rack's position apply to all levels of a rack.

The storage location positions in image 1, which are displayed with white numbers, are identical to the actual names of the storage locations. Numbers were also used as names here. They were numbered in ascending order of the racks.
In some places, however, the route that should be taken through the warehouse does not conform to these numbers. Where this is the case, the position numbers were adjusted accordingly and differ from the names. The green numbers represent the storage location position numbers that were adjusted for an optimal route.

.Warehouse and route planning

[TIP]
.Plan your configuration with the help of a diagram
====
Configure your warehouse according to this illustration or create your own sketch based on the conditions in your warehouse. Set up the warehouse according to a system that is logical and easy to remember. Assign positions to the racks as well as to the storage locations according to the route that will be taken through the warehouse.

=== Creating a warehouse

[TIP]
.Naming warehouses
====
Warehouse names can be chosen freely and can also be changed after the warehouse has been created. However, keep in mind that warehouse names will also appear in other areas within your plentymarkets system, e.g. in the order overview or on a warehouse pick list.
====

[.instruction]
Creating a new warehouse:

. Go to **System » Stock » Warehouse**.
. Click on the small **triangle** on the right-hand side of the line (see image 2, number 1). +
→ The **New warehouse** button will appear (image 2, number 2).
. Click on **New Warehouse**. +
→ The **New warehouse** window will open.
. Enter the settings in the **New warehouse** window.
. **Save** the settings to create a new warehouse. +
→ The warehouse will now be listed under **System » Stock » Warehouse**. The warehouses are displayed in alphabetical order.

Once you have created the warehouse, click on the small **plus icon** to see the submenus for this warehouse. Configure the remaining warehouse settings in the submenus **Settings**, **Racks**, **Box storage racks** and **Label**.

[#400]
=== Completing and editing warehouse settings

After you have created and named the warehouse complete the warehouse information.

[IMPORTANT]
.Use the warehouse delete functions carefully
====
It is possible to delete previously created warehouses. The stock in this warehouse will also be deleted, if you have already booked stock into the warehouse. It is also possible to just delete the stock from a warehouse. In this case the warehouse will remain, but will be empty. The stock can not be restored in either case. Therefore use these delete functions carefully and beware that the warehouse and the stock may be linked to other menus such as listings etc.
====

[.instruction]
Completing and editing warehouse settings

. Go to **System » Stock » Warehouse » Select warehouse » Settings**.
. Carry out the settings. Pay attention to the information given in table 2.
. **Save** the settings.

.**settings** submenu
[cols="a,a"]
|====
|Setting |Explanation

|**Delete stock completely**
|Deletes all of the stock from a warehouse. Use this function carefully. How to procede best when you want to take stock is described on the **<<stock-management/taking-stock#, Carrying out stocktaking>>** page of this manuel.

|**Save**
|Saves the settings.

|**Delete**
|Deletes the warehouse from the system. When you delete a warehouse, you will be asked to transfer this warehouse's old reorders and orders in status &lt; 7 to another warehouse. If you do not select another warehouse for transfer, the old reorders will be deleted with the warehouse and orders will remain the same. When you do not select a transfer warehouse you will probably no longer be able to find orders and reorders that belong to the deleted warehouse. Reorders of a non-existing warehouse can not really exist either and that is the main problem here. +
**Alternatively**: If you are not sure whether you should really delete a warehouse, you could instead switch warehouses that are no longer needed to the warehouse type **Repair warehouse**.

|**Warehouse ID**
|ID of a warehouse

|**Warehouse name**
|Name of the warehouse

|**Warehouse type**
|Select the type depending on the function of the warehouse:  +
**Sales** = Standard warehouse Warehouse for sales with automatic processes, such as stock reservation and status change for offers.  +
**Repair** = Warehouse for returned items. You can assign this warehouse to a specific **sales** warehouse by using the option **Warehouse assigned for repairs**.  +
**Storage** = Warehouse for items that are kept in reserve.  +
**Transit** = Temporary warehouse for assigning items to the destination address when reloading items from one means of transport to another.  +
**Distribution** = Distribution warehouse  +
**Other** = Special warehouse

|**Logistics type**
|Information about who manages the warehouse.  +
**Own warehouse** = The warehouse is managed by you and you take care of the logistics.  +
**Amazon** = Items are distributed by Amazon FBA Multi-Channel.  +
**DHL Fulfillment** = Items are distributed by DHL Fulfillment.  +
**Rhenus** = Items are distributed by Rhenus.

|**Warehouse assigned for repairs**
|Here you can select one of the **repair** warehouses. The repair warehouse is where you want **returned** items to be sent that are in need of repairs. This will let you avoid defective items being mixed together with the normal stock. As soon as the items have been repaired or exchanged, assign them to the distribution warehouse.  +
The stock of a repair warehouse can not be transmitted to the online store or other platforms. The stock of a repair warehouse provides an overview about whether or not items are still being repaired. Therefore, the stock can not be sold.  +
Create the desired repair warehouse so that it is available in this drop-down menu.

|**Priority**
|Set the priority of the warehouse. From **+** (lowest priority) to **+++++** (highest priority).

|**Split up according to shipping profile**
|Select **Yes** if you are working with **<<order-processing/orders/managing-sales-orders#delivery-order, delivery orders>>**.

|**Location**
|The location of the warehouse.  +
Here, you can select the countries that were set up as countries of delivery under **<<order-processing/fulfilment/preparing-the-shipment#, System » Orders » Shipping » Shipping options » Tab: Countries of delivery>>**.

|**Standard zone**
|The standard zone that you want to have automatically set as default in the warehouse settings, e.g. in the **Warehouse** tab within the item editing window.

|**Standard storage location type**
|The standard storage location type that you want to have automatically set as default in the warehouse settings, e.g. in the **Warehouse** tab within the item editing window.

|**Availability with** and **without stock**
|This option specifies which availability should be displayed when stock is available and when it is not available. This setting takes priority over the **Availablility** symbol selected in the **Settings** tab of a variation.  However the symbols only switch correctly if you activated the **Available, Not available** settings within the variation's **Settings** tab.  +
The stock needs to be recalculated after changes have been made. To recalculate stock go to <<stock-management/managing-stocks#, **Stock » Stocks**>> and click on the **Recalculate stocks** button.  +
The symbols displayed directly depend on the symbols in **System » Item » Availability** menu. Only symbols that you saved an **Online store icon** for will be available here.

|**Note**
|Enter notes about the warehouse. Notes can be anything you wish to save as additional information about a warehouse.

|**Stocktaking mode active**
|The **<<stock-management/setting-up-a-warehouse#3, stocktaking mode>>** will freeze the stock of the warehouse while you are busy taking stock.

=== Creating racks with shelves and storage locations

Racks are divided into shelves and storage locations. The shelves lie on different levels. Your items and variations are actually stored in the storage locations and the storage locations are on shelves. You need to set up all division of a warehouse down to the smallest division - the storage location - to define the exact spot that a variation is at.  To begin with a name is enough to save a rack. You can reopen the rack settings anytime to carry out further settings. However, you need a shelf and a storage location to book variants in and out. Without shelves and storage locations stock bookings are not possible.
