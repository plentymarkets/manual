This chapter provides information about the different options for editing warehouses and other related settings.
Here, you learn how to create a new warehouse that replicates your real-life warehouse 1:1 in your plentymarkets system.
Furthermore, you learn how to set up box storage racks that can be used as interim storage for multi order picking.

* Setting up your warehouse effectively is a crucial step for the shipping process and helps you save a lot of time.
Thus, take some time beforehand to consider how to replicate your warehouse effectively and establish optimal picking routes.
* To make optimal use of all tools, such as link:https://marketplace.plentymarkets.com/en/plugins/externe-tools/plentyBase_5053/[plentyBase^], assign a *label* with a barcode to each storage location.

[IMPORTANT]
.To register stock and book incoming orders, you need at least one warehouse.
====
Your plentymarkets system comes with 2 sample warehouses: one distribution warehouse and one repair warehouse. You can either rename and continue using these warehouses or delete them and set up your own ones. To register stock and book incoming items, your system must have at least one warehouse. Consequently, you cannot manage your stock without a warehouse. Incoming orders are assigned to a warehouse according to item availability.

== Planning a warehouse

Warehouses consist of dimensions. All dimensions together constitute the layout of your warehouse. These dimensions can be freely defined. When defining the dimensions, start with the smallest dimension and continue with all further dimensions in ascending order.

[IMPORTANT]
.Applying sample dimensions
====
The layout of sample warehouses and newly-created warehouses alike always provides 2 sample dimensions. These dimensions are not saved. You can apply, rename or delete dimensions. However, you need at least one dimension to create a storage location.

.Structuring a warehouse
[cols="1,3"]
|====
|Setting|Explanation

|*Dimension*
|Dimensions are the basic structuring units of your warehouse. Later on, the dimensions function as a basis for the actual levels of a warehouse. Levels are the concrete applications of a dimension. For example, if you define a storage building as a dimension in your layout, storage buildings 1, 2 and 3 are its concrete applications. +
*_Note:_* At least one dimension is needed to create storage locations.

|*Storage location*
|In plentymarkets, storage locations are no dimensions. Storage locations are the actual places in which you keep your products. You need at least one dimension to create a storage location. Dimensions are superior to storage locations.
|====

A pick list with optimal picking routes depends on the position of the storage locations. Your settings determine if a dimension influences the position of storage locations. A pick list begins with the lowest position and is sorted in ascending order.

[#200]
== Setting up a warehouse

The process of setting up a warehouse consists of 3 basic steps. First, enter general information such as the name and the purpose of the warehouse. Then add further general information, such as the address of the warehouse. In step 2, you create dimensions that subdivide your warehouse. As a last step, you create storage locations.

[#300]
=== Managing general warehouse data

You have to manage the following data for each warehouse, no matter if you edit and continue working with sample warehouses or if you create new warehouses.

[.instruction]
Creating a new warehouse:

. Go to *System » Stock » Warehouse*.
. Click on *New warehouse*.
. Enter the name.
. Select a *Warehouse type*.
. Select a *Logistics type*.
. *Save* the settings to create a new warehouse. +
→ The settings of the warehouse, in which you manage further general data, are opened.

The new warehouse is added to the warehouse list in alphabetical order.

[.instruction]
Managing general warehouse data:

. Go to *System » Stock » Warehouse*.
. Open a warehouse.
. Click on *Settings*.
. Carry out the settings according to <<table-general-warehouse-settings>>.
. *Save* the settings.

[[table-general-warehouse-settings]]
.General warehouse data
[cols="1,2"]
|====
|Setting |Explanation

|*Warehouse ID*
|ID of the warehouse. Is automatically assigned by the system and cannot be edited.

|*Warehouse name*
|Name of the warehouse.

|*Warehouse type*
|Selecting a warehouse type according to purpose: +
*Sales* = Standard warehouse. Warehouse for sales with automatic processes, such as stock reservation and status change for orders.  +
*Repair* = Warehouse for returned items. This warehouse can be selected as an *Assigned warehouse for repairs* for *Sales* warehouses.  +
*Storage* = Warehouse for items that are in stock. +
*Transit* = Temporary warehouse for assigning items to the destination address when transferring items from one means of transport to another.  +
*Distribution* = Distribution warehouse +
*Other* = Special warehouse

|*Logistics type*
|Information about the party managing the warehouse.  +
*Own warehouse* = Logistics are managed in your own warehouse.  +
*Amazon* = Items are distributed via Amazon FBA Multi-Channel.  +
*DHL Fulfilment* = Items are distributed via DHL Fulfilment.

|*Warehouse assigned for repairs*
|Here, you can select *Repair* warehouses. This selection links a warehouse to a repair warehouse, in which e.g. *returned items* can be stored for repairs. This way, faulty items are not mixed up with regular stock. Once the items have been repaired or replaced, re-assign them to the sales warehouse.  +
The stock of a repair warehouse cannot be transferred to your online store or other platforms. The stock of a repair warehouse provides an overview on items that are currently being repaired. Thus, this stock cannot be sold. +
Create the desired repair warehouse so that it becomes available in this drop-down menu.

|*Priority*
|Determine the priority of the warehouse. From *pass:[+]* (lowest priority) to *pass:[+++++]* (highest priority).

|*Split up according to shipping profile*
|In case you are working with <<order-processing/orders/managing-orders#delivery-order, Delivery orders>>, select *Yes* here.

|*Location*
|Location of the warehouse.  +
This is a selection of countries of delivery as defined in <<order-processing/fulfilment/preparing-the-shipment#100, System » Orders » Shipping » Settings » Countries of delivery>>.

|*Standard storage location type*
|The standard storage location type which should be set as default for warehouse settings, e.g. in the *Warehouse* tab in the item settings.

|*Dynamic reorder level*
|Choose between active and inactive. +
*active* = the difference between the actual order and the reorder level is calculated for variations stored in this warehouse on the basis of the dynamic reorder level. The dynamic reorder level itself is not yet displayed in your system. +
Note: To calculate the difference to the reorder level on the basis of the dynamic reorder level for a variation, the <<stock management/managing-reorders/#500, reorder level of the variation>> must be 0. +
*inactive* = the difference to the reorder level for variations in this warehouse is not calculated based on the dynamic reorder level, but based on the <<stock management/managing-reorders/#500, manually defined reorder level>>. Thus, you can enter a reorder level bigger than 0 for a variation.

|*Average price*
|Choose how the average price for the warehouse is calculated. +
*Purchase price of stock quantities* = the average purchase price for variations in this warehouse is calculated based on the purchase prices of the existing stock quantity. It is recalculated with all incoming items and outgoing items. This calculation method is called live average calculation. +
*Purchase price of variations* = the average purchase price for variations in this warehouse is calculated based on the purchase price saved in the variation data. +
*Moving average price of a variation* = the average purchase price for variations in this warehouse is flexibly calculated. In this case, the average purchase price is calculated with all incoming items, but not with outgoing items. +
The calculation methods are described in depth in the chapter <<stock-management/new-incoming items#250, Identifying the purchase price>>.


|*Availability with stock* and +
 *Availability without stock*
|These options determine which availability is displayed if stock exists or does not exist. This setting takes priority over the symbol selected to represent *Availability* in the *Settings* tab of a variation. However, it is important that the options *Available, Not available* have been selected as well in the *Settings* tab of a variation. +
The stock has to be recalculated after all changes. This recalculation is carried out in the menu <<stock-management/managing-stock#, Stock » Stocks>> by clicking on *Recalculate stocks*. +
The availability symbols are displayed according to the settings made in the section *Online store icon* in the menu *System » Item » Availability*.

|*Note*
|Enter your notes, i.e. all additional information about the warehouse that you wish to save.

|*Stocktaking mode active*
|The <<stock-management/taking-stock#500, stocktaking mode>> freezes the stock quantity of the warehouse while you are taking stock.
|====

[#400]
=== Creating dimensions

Create dimensions in order to separate your warehouse into basic elements. At least one dimension is needed to create storage locations. For example, a dimension can be a storeroom. You can create up to 10 dimensions for each warehouse. The dimensions are the basis for the levels of a warehouse. +
Consider in advance which dimensions you want to create, and start with the smallest one. Create the dimensions in ascending order.

[IMPORTANT]
.Applying or deleting sample dimensions
====
The layout of each warehouse contains 2 sample dimensions. These dimensions are not saved. You can apply, rename or delete them. However, you need at least one dimension to create a storage location.
====

[.instruction]
Creating a dimension:

. Go to *System » Stock » Warehouse*.
. Open a warehouse.
. Click on *Dimensions*.
. Enter a name for the dimension.
. Carry out further optional settings. Pay attention to the information provided in <<table-Settings-Dimensions>>.
. Click on *Add new dimension*. +
→ You can now add another dimension. To do so, repeat steps 4 to 6.
. *Save* the settings in order to create the dimensions.

New dimensions are automatically added as the biggest ones. If you add further dimensions, they take priority, i.e. they are bigger. Thus, you should begin with the smallest dimension.

*_Note:_* As long as there are no storage locations, it is possible to delete all dimensions. If storage locations exist, there has to be at least one dimension.
