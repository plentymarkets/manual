You want to save your stock on a daily basis and thus be able to backup your data?

These Best Practices guide you through the process and show how to add up the stock of two warehouses as well as how to determine the stock at any time. The process is carried out via the export and starts with the processing of the data fields in the FormatDesigner. In a first step the format stock is created and an assignment is selected.

== Step 1: Creating data fields and selecting an assignment

. Go to *Data » FormatDesigner*.
. If not available yet, create the format *Stock*.
. *Save* the settings. +
-> The overview of the data fields opens.
. Select the field *ItemDescription* and in its submenu select the field *name*. +
-> The field is created on the left.
. Create all other data fields below.
. Click in all columns on the arrow *Assignment* (see screenshot of the data fields).
. For the data fields Item.id, Variation.id and ItemDescription.name, select the assignment *VORGABE DURCH EXPORT EN (predefined by export?)*.
. For all other data fields, select the respective warehouse as assignment.
. *Save* the settings.

== Step 2: Calculating the physical stock

In a next step the physical stock is calculated. If both warehouses have a positive stock it is added up. However, if one of the two warehouses has a negative stock it is subtracted. +
Assign the respective warehouse to the warehouses a and b and add up the net stock and the physical stock.

== Step 3: Changing the value

The following example shows how to change the value of the physical stock Variationstock.physicalStock (see screenshot of the data fields).

. In the overview of the data fields, select a data field from the warehouse section (VariationStock). +
-> The assignment of the warehouse is shown.
. On the right, click on *Change value* in order to adapt the value.
. *Save* the settings.

Afterwards you can assign the warehouses as shown in the following example.

== Elastic export

For the Elastic export you can specify a time at that the file is put on the server every day. To do so, go to *Data » Elastic export* and create a new Elastic export. For further information on how to set up an FTP access, see <<basics/admin-tasks/ftp-access#, here>>.

. In the menu *Data » elastic export* click on *New export*.
. In the field *Provisioning* select the option *FTP*.
. Fill in the remaining fields as shown in the following example.
. *Save* the settings.
