In the *Stock » Reorder management » Purchase order*, your plentymarkets system offers you to redistribute items between different warehouses.

A redistribution consists of the following steps:

* <<#600, Creating a redistribution>>
* <<#700, Adding order items>>
* <<#800, Generating a PO delivery note>>
* <<#900, Booking items out>>
* <<#1000, Booking variations in>>
* <<#1100, Finishing a redistribution>>

We recommend carrying out some preparatory settings before working with redistributions.


[#100]
== Preparatory settings
To optimise your workflow using warehouse redistributions, we recommend carrying out some preparatory settings. These settings are described in the following. Create new order statuses especially for reorders and create tags to keep a good overview. Setting up a document template for the *PO delivery note* is required as well.

[#200]
=== Creating order statuses for redistributions
A certain number of statuses is saved in your plentymarkets system by default. Those default order statuses can also be used for redistributions. You can create statuses that are exclusively used for this particular order type. Creating new order statuses is described in detail on the <<orders/managing-orders#1200, Managing orders>> page of the manual.

[TIP]
.Creating own order statuses for redistributions
====
We recommend creating separate order statuses that you only use for working with redistributions. Assign particular names to the order statuses to distinguish between redistributions and other order types. This is particularly important when automating the redistribution with the help of <<#1100, event procedures>>.
====

[#300]
=== Creating tags for redistributions
Tags are keywords that you create centrally before you can use them to mark data in different areas of your plentymarkets system. If you want to use tags with redistributions, you need to create those tags beforehand in the *Setup » Settings » Tags* menu. To do so, follow the instructions on the <<welcome/general-functions/tags#, Tags>> page of the manual.

[#400]
=== Carrying out default settings
You can determine default settings to reduce the workload involved in creating a new redistribution. The default settings are then automatically displayed in the data fields when creating a new redistribution. To do so, proceed as described below.

[.instruction]
Carrying out default settings:

. Go to *Setup » Stock » Reorder management » Redistribution » Settings*.
. Select a *Default status* that should be preselected when creating a redistribution.
. Carry out the desired settings for the *Default owner*. Pay attention to the information provided in <<table-default-owner-redistribution>>.
. *Save* the settings. +
→ The selected default settings are displayed when creating new redistributions.

[[table-default-owner-redistribution]]
.Available settings for the default owner
[cols="1,3"]
|====
|Setting |Explanation

| *Active owner preselected*
|The user creating the redistribution in the plentymarkets back end is preselected in the *Owner* field.

| *No owner preselected*
|The *Owner* field remains empty when creating a new redistribution.

|====

[#500]
=== Setting up a template for the PO delivery note
Working with redistributions requires using the particular document type *PO delivery note* (PO = Purchase order). This delivery note lists all variations included in a redistribution.  Warehouse staff and logistics partners can use this document to keep track of the variations included when booking the order items in in the receiving warehouse.

[IMPORTANT]
.Document template must be set up
====
The document template for the document *PO delivery note* has to be set up before creating the document for the first time. As long as the document template has not been set up, no delivery note can be generated for a redistribution.
====

The following instructions describe how to transfer the default document template saved in your plentymarkets system.

[.instruction]
Setting up a template for the PO delivery note:

. Go to *Setup » Stock » Reorder management » Redistribution » Documents » PO delivery note*.
. Open the *transfer* tab.
. Select the language from the drop-down list above the tab title.
. In the *Apply settings from default document template* area, click on *Accept*. +
→ The default document template is applied to the document.

To set up the document *PO delivery note* according to your individual wishes, proceed as described in the <<orders/order-documents#300, Setting up a document template>> chapter.

[#600]
== Creating a redistribution
After having carried out the preparatory settings, you can proceed with creating an order of the type redistribution.

[.instruction]
Creating a new redistribution:

. Go to *Stock » Reorder management » Purchase order*.
. Move the cursor over the *Plus icon* and click on *New redistribution*. +
→ The menu for creating a new redistribution opens.
. In the *Status* field, select an initial <<#200, status>> that should be assigned to the new redistribution. This status can be changed at a later point in time.
. In the *Sender* field, select the warehouse from which items should be booked out.
. In the *Receiver* field, select the warehouse into which the items should be booked.
. *_Optional:_* Select one or several *Tags* to mark the new redistribution.
. *_Optional:_* Select an *Owner*, meaning the user responsible for the redistribution.

[IMPORTANT]
.Selecting an owner
====
If the desired *Owner* is missing, check if the user has been activated as an owner. Proceed according to the instructions on the <<business-decisions/user-accounts-access#40, Managing user accounts>> page of the manual to activate owners. In addition, check the <<#400, default settings>> for owners described above.
====

[#700]
=== Adding order items
The next step consists of adding the items that should be redistributed from one warehouse to another. Use the *Filter* to search for the desired order items according to the available <<item/managing-items#_filtering_items, item and variation data>>.

[#800]
=== Generating a PO delivery note
After adding the order items to the redistribution, the stock movements are already prepared. The red arrows on the *Stock movements* table represent those prepared stock movements.
We urgently recommend that you check the stock movements as well as the quantities included in this table before proceeding with the redistribution. Afterwards, proceed with generating a *PO delivery note* that lists all order items included in the redistribution.

You can also upload other documents belonging to a redistribution in the *Documents* section.

[#830]

== Automating redistributions
Use event procedures to automate the separate working steps of a redistribution. One possibility of automating the generation of the *PO delivery note* has already been described in the <<#870, Automatically generating a PO delivery note>> chapter. In the *Setup » Orders » Events* menu, the events, filters and procedures available in the groups named *Goods* allow you to automate certain steps of the redistribution. +

For more detailed information on setting up event procedures, refer to the <<automation/event-procedures#, Event procedures>> page of the manual. +
If you are working with event procedures for the first time, pay attention to the information provided on creating event procedures in the chapter <<automation/event-procedures#100, Creating a new event procedure>>.
