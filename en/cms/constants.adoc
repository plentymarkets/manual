Use the text fields of the **CMS » Constants** menu to insert recurring content into several pages of your online store. 25 constants are available. Constants allow you to reuse content. Instead of editing each occurrence of a text, you can edit it in this menu once. The content may contain HTML code or e.g. JavaScript code. In addition, **<<cms/settings/item-gallery#, item galleries  >>** are linked using constants.

== Defining constants

To define a constant, save a value for this constant first. To do so, proceed as follows. If you link a constant to an item gallery, code will automatically be inserted as the constant's **value**. This is why you do not need to enter a value for constants that you want to link with an **<<cms/settings/item-gallery#, item gallery  >>**.

[.instruction]
Defining constants:

. Go to **CMS » Constants**.
. Enter the content into the text field of the constant you want to use.
. **Save** the settings. +
&amp;rarr; The content will be displayed in the online store when the constant is inserted into the design.

[TIP]
.How to include PHP scripts
====
You can not save PHP scripts as constants. Save PHP scripts externally, e.g. on an FTP server. Then save a link to this script as the constant's **Value** to retrieve it.
