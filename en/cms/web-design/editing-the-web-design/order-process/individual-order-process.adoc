The order process refers to the process that a customer goes through when buying something in the online store. It begins the moment a customer puts an item in his or her shopping cart and it continues until the moment that the order is sent. The individual order process is selected by default in **Callisto Light**. The individual order process gives you total control over what the order process looks like, how many functions it includes and how customers are guided through this process. You can define up to ten steps, which determine how customers will be led through the personalized order process. Additionally, you can customize the steps **Login**, **Logout**, **Customer registration**, **Forgot your password** and **Order confirmation**. +
This page of the manual teaches you how the individual order process is structured and which settings can be configured. +
The settings are carried out separately for each design and client (store). The number and content of the individual steps of the order process are also set for each client individually.

Due to technical reasons, you will not be able to switch back to the default order process once you have already implemented the individual order process.

== Components of the individual order process in Callisto Light

The chapters **Categories**, **Order steps**, **The header "Purchase"** and **Additional pages** describe how the individual order process is structured.

=== Categories

The individual order process relies heavily on categories of the type <<item/categories/editing-container-categories#, **Container**  >>. This type of category can access all of the global template variables and functions that are used for the templates under **CMS » Web design » Layout » Checkout**. Conversely, global template variables and functions can be used to grant categories of the type **Container** access to template-specific variables and functions, i.e. non-global variables and functions. As such, the entire order process can be represented with categories. It is no longer absolutely necessary to use templates in the individual order process. The categories for Callisto Light are found in plentymarkets under **Item » Categories**. They are located in the web design's folder. There you can customize the content of the order steps. Use <<cms-syntax/web-design/pagedesign/link#, **link functions**  >> to create links from one category to another. You can use these previously defined functions:

[cols="a,a"]
|====
|Function call |Returned link

|**Link_CustomerRegistration()**
|Customer registration

|**Link_LostPassword()**
|Forgot your password

|**Link_OrderConfirmation()**
|Order confirmation

|**Link_Checkout(1)**
|Log in

|**Link_Checkout(2)**
|Shopping cart

|**Link_Checkout(3)**
|Purchase

|**Link_Checkout(4)**
|Order details

|**Link_Checkout(5)**
|Address

|**Link_Checkout(x)**
|x: order step number in the order process
|====

__Table 1: predefined template functions__

You can use anchor tags to link categories like **Customer registration** and **Order confirmation** anywhere in the order process.

__Code example 1: code for the **Checkout** button__

Code example 1 is located in the **Shopping cart** category in Callisto Light. This code displays the **Checkout** button to customers (image 1). The code also checks whether the customer has already logged into the online store. If the customer is not logged in, then the function **Link_CustomerRegistration()** will be saved for the button's href attribute. The customer will be forwarded to the registration page after clicking on the **Checkout** button. Here, the customer can either log into the online store or create a new customer account. If the customer is already logged into the online store, then the link will lead to the **Order details** step, i.e. the link will lead to the first step of the **Purchase** header. This is because the template function **Link_Checkout(3)** was saved in the code.

__Image 1: the **Checkout** button that is displayed with code example 1__

=== Order steps

Categories are linked to the eight order steps of the individual order process in **Callisto Light**. These links are saved in the **<<cms/web-design/editing-the-web-design#, design settings  >>** (image 2).

Eight steps are saved for the order process in **Callisto Light**:

. Shopping cart
. Log in
. Purchase
. Order details
. Address
. Payment &amp; shipping
. Order overview &amp; transaction
. Order process

These eight steps are displayed with categories of the type **Container**. The categories for Callisto Light are found in plentymarkets under **Item » Categories**. They are located in the web design's folder. Two other order steps are also available (9th order process step and 10th order process step). It is possible to set up a total of ten order steps in the individual order process (image 2). It is also possible to create five additional pages (image 2).

image::cms/web-design/editing-the-web-design/order-process/assets/EN-CMS-Individual-Order-Process-02.png[]

__Image 2: predefined order steps in **Callisto Light**__

The following table lists the ten order steps that can be configured in the individual order process. Furthermore, the table explains the function of these steps in the front end, i.e. in the online store.

[cols="a,a,a"]

__Table 2: order steps in the individual order process__

=== The header "Purchase"

The third order step is the category **Purchase**. This category is a special case as it includes the four order steps described in table 2. The category **Purchase** displays each of these four steps in succession. The purchase category is used to display a header and progress bar in the individual order process of **Callisto Light**. The progress bar shows customers which part of the order process they are currently completing (image 3).

__Table 3: order steps in the header **Purchase**__

**Callisto Light** uses JavaScript to dynamically show and hide steps of the order process. Customers enter data while they complete the four order steps in the "Purchase" header (image 3). REST calls are used in the background to exchange this data with the server and keep it up-to-date. The code for displaying the **Purchase** header is found in plentymarkets under **Item » Categories** when you open the folder for your design and click on the category **Purchase**.

The function **CategoryContentBody($_id)** loads the code for the four order steps in the category **Purchase**. It is easiest to find the order steps by searching for the HTML comments in the category.

[cols="a,a"]
|====
|Order process step |HTML comment

|**Order details**
|STEP 1: Order details

|**Address**
|STEP 2: Addresses

|**Payment &amp; shipping**
|STEP 3: Shipping &amp; Payment

|**Overview &amp; contract closure**
|STEP 4: Overview &amp; Confirmation
|====

__Table 4: order steps in the category **Purchase**__

Code example 2 shows how the content of the header **Purchase** is loaded in **Callisto Light** with the order steps **Order details**, **Address**, **Payment &amp; shipping** and **Overview &amp; contract closure**.

Code example 2 is located in the **Purchase** category and contains the order steps listed above. Line 7 of code example 2 includes the command **$_id= CheckoutStepPageID(4)**. This command saves the ID of the **Order details** step in the variable **$_id**. The number in parentheses after **CheckoutStepPageID** is the order step number that was saved in the design settings (image 2). In this example, the variable **$_id** is given the category ID for the 4th order step. In image 2, this is the ID 17464. In line 8, the attribute **data-plenty-checkout-content** is given the value that is saved in **$_id**. The code **data-plenty-checkout-content="$_id"** changes to **data-plenty-checkout-content="17464"**. The code **CategoryContentBody($_id)** in line 13 is used to access the content that was saved in the **Order details** category.

__Code example 2: order steps of the category Purchase__

=== Additional pages

You can customize the following fives pages of the individual order process in addition to the ten order steps. These pages are also designed with categories:

* Login
* Logout
* Customer registration
* Forgot your password
* Order confirmation

== Content of the order steps

Global template functions load the HTML structure for individual order steps within the individual order process. These template functions provide the basic framework for displaying order data. By using REST calls, you can continuously transmit order data between the Client and the server. This ensures that data is up-to-date and consistent within the order steps.

The template **PageDesignPrepareMainColumn** specifies which elements should be loaded in the order steps.

=== HTML framework

The checkout templates display order data in the order steps. These templates are composed of HTML code, which structures the content of the order steps. The templates are found under **CMS » Web design » Layout » Checkout**. Table 5 lists order steps along with the checkout templates that are used. For example, the order step **Shopping cart** uses the command **Container_CheckoutBasketItemsList()** to load the HTML framework for the item overview in the shopping cart. The template is found under **CMS » Web design » Layout » Checkout » CheckoutBasketItemsList**.

[cols="a,a"]
|====
|Category |Container

|**Shopping cart**
|Container_CheckoutBasketItemsList() +
Container_CheckoutTotals() +
Container_CheckoutCoupon()

|**Order details**
|Container_CheckoutCoupon()

|**Address**
|Container_CheckoutCustomerInvoiceAddress() +
Container_CheckoutCustomerShippingAddress()

|**Payment &amp; shipping**
|Container_CheckoutMethodsOfPaymentList() +
Container_CheckoutShippingProfilesList()

|**Order overview &amp; transaction**
|Container_CheckoutMethodsOfPaymentList() +
Container_CheckoutShippingProfilesList()
|====

__Table 5: available checkout templates__

=== Loading individual elements

Global variables are defined in the template **PageDesignPrepareMainColumn** under **CMS » Web design » Layout » PageDesign**. These global variables are defined with the help of the template function **<<cms-syntax/web-design/pagedesign/setglobal#, setGlobal  >>**. This allows you to influence the visibility of elements, e.g. the entry fields for forms. Use the information under the comment **# CHECKOUT VALIDATION &amp; APPEARANCE** to specify how elements should be displayed in the individual order process (table 6).

[cols="a,a,a"]
|====
|Function |Default value |Explanation

|**SetGlobal("ShowTabDetails", true);**
|true
|Displays the tab **Order details** in the header **Purchase**.

|**SetGlobal("ShowCustomerSign", true);**
|true
|Displays the entry field **Your reference**.

|**SetGlobal("ValidateCustomerSign", false);**
|false
|Validates the entry field **Your reference**.

|**SetGlobal("ShowCustomerNotice", true);**
|true
|Displays the entry field **Your notes &amp; special requests**.

|**SetGlobal("ShowCouponInDetails", true);**
|true
|Displays the entry field **Coupon code**.
|====

__Table 6: template functions for the order details__

=== Displaying the payment methods

The global function **Container_CheckoutMethodsOfPaymentList** is found under **Item » Categories** when you open the folder for your design (e.g. callisto_light_3) and click on the category **Payment &amp; shipping**. This global function accesses the template **CheckoutMethodsOfPaymentList** under **CMS » Web design » Layout » Checkout**, which displays all of the available <<payment/managing-payment-methods#, **payment methods**  >>. It generates an HTML list with radio buttons, which customers can use to select a payment method (code example 3).

__Code example 3: the template **CheckoutMethodsOfPaymentList**__

A change event is triggered when the payment method is selected. This event communicates with the server. The event uses the function call **plenty.CheckoutService.setMethodOfPayment** to transmit the payment method that was selected by the customer. The function is part of the **plentymarketsCMStools** and carries out the REST calls for the change event. The following code is part of the template **CheckoutMethodsOfPayment**. It displays the change event with the function call **plenty.CheckoutService.setMethodOfPayment**.

__Code example 4: change event in the template **CheckoutMethodsOfPayment**__

== Validating the order data

The plentymarkets CMS validators make sure that your customers entered valid information during the order process. The server validates all of the data that customers entered before saving this data in the database. For example, it makes sure that email addresses have the correct format. It also makes sure that entry fields such as the street and house number use meaningful combinations of letters and numbers. The validators are found in your plentymarkets system under **CMS » Web design » Layout » Validator**. The following validators are relevant to the order process:

[cols="a,a"]
|====
|Validator template |Explanation

|**ValidatorCustomerInvoiceAddress**
|Validates the entries for the invoice address.

|**ValidatorCustomerShippingAddress**
|Validates the entries for the delivery address.

|**ValidatorPlaceOrder**
|Validates the entries for the last order step **Overview &amp; contract closure**.
|====

__Table 7: validators for the order process__

The template **ValidatorPlaceOrder** checks whether customers placed check marks next to the general terms and conditions, privacy policy or newsletter. The validator templates can be customized to specify which data should be checked and which messages should be displayed if errors occur. The following code checks whether the customer accepted the general terms and conditions by placing a check mark. If a check mark is placed, then the boolean **$TermsAndConditionsCheck** is set to the value 1. The call **AddError(16)** displays error code 16 if an error occurs, i.e. **$TermsAndConditionsCheck!= 1**.
