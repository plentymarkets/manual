== General information about buttons

You have 3 possibilities to configure your store buttons. The first option is to use the **Button editor** and choose from a wide variety of button backgrounds. A text for the button is already available or you can enter your own text. Another option is to create an **individual button**. If you choose this option, then you will need to upload a button. The third option is to use the **HTML button**. This option allows you to style your button directly in the CSS.

The options **Button editor** and **Individual button** are described in further detail below. If you want to use the option **HTML button**, you will need to select it here and you will need HTML skills to adjust the CSS.

== Configuring buttons with the button editor

In this menu, basic button settings are specified when working with the button editor. Here you configure the characteristics of the text and the background.

[WARNING]
.Button texts and legal aspects
====
Pay attention to __**legal aspects**__ when choosing a name for a button. According to German law e.g. the order button needs to include a text that clearly states that the customer is purchasing something that is subject to charge. The German requirement is met in plentymarkets. Therefore the German default text is **Zahlungspflichtig bestellen**.
====

Make sure you comply with the legal requirements of the country you are based in.

== Template functions and template variables

By default, each plentymarkets system includes the basic buttons that are necessary for an online store. You need to use **template functions** to insert some of the buttons into the design. The template functions (table 2) are found in the **CMS » Web design** menu. General examples and descriptions about **template functions** and **template variables** can be found in the **<<cms-syntax#, CMS syntax  >>** section of the manual.

The following table lists the template functions that are available for **buttons**:

== Individual button

In this section, you can upload the buttons that you created yourself. The file formats **PNG**, **GIF** or **JPG** are accepted. The individual buttons can not be edited further in plentymarkets. The text, colors etc. have to be included in the picture exactly the way you want them to be displayed.

[.instruction]
Uploading individual buttons:

. Create a **button** or have someone create it for you and then save the file on your computer's hard drive.
. Go to **CMS » Web design » Buttons » Tab: Settings**.
. Open the button's submenu.
. Click on the **Individual button** tab.
. Click on **Browse...**.
. Select the saved button **file** from your hard drive.
. Click on **open**.
. Click on the **save** icon to upload the button.

A button preview will be shown when you reload the menu. In addition, the note **Individual button is active!** will be shown in the **Configuration** tab.

== Group functions

Use the **Group functions** menu to apply a particular layout to all of the buttons for a certain language. With this function, for example, you simultaneously change the text alignment, font size, font color, page margins and background graphic for all buttons of an online store design in one specific language. And you can do this with just a few clicks of the mouse.

. Go to **CMS » Web design » Buttons » Tab: Settings » Group functions**.

== Buttons with customized backgrounds

Upload your own **background graphics** for buttons in the **Individual background** tab. These will then be displayed under **Background list**.

Afterwards, select the background in a button's **Configuration** tab.

Make sure that both the background image and the individual button fields have the correct dimensions.

__Image 3: **individual background** menu__

In image 4 shows an example for a background image and has the dimensions 634 x 63 pixels. The graphic's individual **__button fields__** correspond to the possibilities for settings under **Button size** in the editing window (image 1). The arrangement in image 4, however, is exactly the opposite of the selection in the menu. The top line of buttons defines the **__normal color__** of the button. The lower line of buttons defines the **mouseover** color of the button. This is the color that will be shown when you hover your mouse over the button. **PNG** is the data format that is best suited for creating buttons. **JPG** and **GIF** are also possible.

The button fields have the following **dimensions**:

[cols="a,a,a"]
|====
|Button field |Width |Height

|**XL**
|245 pixels
|31 pixels

|**L**
|172 pixels
|31 pixels

|**M**
|134 pixels
|31 pixels

|**S**
