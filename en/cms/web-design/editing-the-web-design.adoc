== How the design is structured

The design in plentymarkets is based on a __**template system**__. The word template is used here to describe an HTML template, which determines the appearance of a particular area. There are templates for displaying items, search results and categories. The content is displayed by using **HTML** and **CSS**, as well as by embedding <<cms-syntax/basics/variables#, **template variables**  >> and **<<cms-syntax/basics/template-functions#, template functions  >>**.

A template can consist of one individual or several HTML fragments. Several HTML fragments are necessary if the content should be displayed in a loop, e.g. in the form of a <<cms/web-design/basic-information-about-syntax/displaying-lists#, **list**  >>. Loops are used, for example, when displaying item lists. In doing so, the same HTML fragment is displayed repeatedly.

== Web design menu

The **CMS » Web design » Layout** menu contains various **templates** for customizing your item and category views, page design and navigation. These templates are sorted into different **folders**. This page teaches you how the templates are structured, where you can find the code and how you can edit it. Furthermore, you will learn how to find available **template variables and template functions** and insert them into the code. You will also find information about working with **__CSS formats__** and will learn how to add <<cms-syntax/basics/if#, **if queries**  >> to your templates.

The word template is used here to describe an HTML template, which determines the appearance of a particular area. For example, there are templates for the item layout and for defining the item search results. +
The template **PageDesignContentMainFrame** is the graphic layout framework of your online store. This template includes template variables and template functions that refer to other templates. The content of the corresponding template will be displayed in place of the variables or function.

__Table 1: assigning the category pages__

For the export and import, a design's category links will be taken into consideration. When importing a design, missing categories will be newly created in a folder with the design's name. This process is carried out automatically. Customize the content of the categories accordingly.

=== Publish design

The **Publish design** function updates a design after it was __**created**__ or __**imported**__. Use this function to publish the design any time you make changes. This will prevent the design from being displayed incorrectly.

=== Creating a new design

New designs are created on the basis of an existing design. This gives you a backup copy of the design as well. You can make changes to the newly created design. If an error occurs, then you will still have the original design and you can use it to create a new design.

[WARNING]
.Backup copy
====
If you want to make comprehensive changes to the design, then it is a good idea to create a new design on the basis of the current design. Then simply edit the new design.
====

Give the new design a name that allows you to tell it apart from the current design.

[TIP]
.Tip: Naming new designs
====
It is a good idea to give your designs names that include ascending __**numbers**__ or a __**date**__. This will help you keep track of your designs, especially if you make changes on a regular basis.

**Example**:

__**StoreDesign_01**__

__**StoreDesign_02**__

or

__**StoreDesign_2014-05-07**__

__**StoreDesign_2014-05-12**__

== Editing templates

For further information about editing templates, refer to the other pages within this chapter. For further information about applying a template to a different language version, refer to the <<cms/web-design/user-interface#3-2, **User interface** >> page of the manual. Specifically, refer to the **Apply template** section.

== CSS

**CSS** (Cascading Style Sheets) denotes a markup language for structured documents. While HTML lets you create the pure content, CSS allows you to influence the __**overall format**__ and structure of this content, as well as to influence the design of a website. One advantage is that you can specify formatting in CSS and it will apply to all areas of the website. Then any necessary changes to the CSS are also made in one central location. This saves you a lot of time, minimizes the risk of errors and gives your website a consistent design. For more information, refer to the <</#, **CSS** >> page of the manual.
