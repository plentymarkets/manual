This area contains all information about incoming orders and how to proceed after receiving orders. Depending on the sales strategy and markets you choose, orders from different <<orders/order-referrer#, referrers>> are transferred to your plentymarkets system. Apart from your own online shop, order referrers are primarily the different <<markets#, markets and price search engines>>.

Among others, plentymarkets offers you an extensive interface to <<markets/amazon/amazon-setup#, Amazon>>. This interface does not only include automatic synchronisation with Seller Central, but also further services offered by Amazon such as for example <<markets/amazon/amazon-fulfilment#, Fulfilment by Amazon>>.

Thanks to the comprehensive <<markets/ebay/ebay-setup#, eBay>> interface integrated in plentymarkets, you can start listings and display eBay shop items on eBay, retrieve orders, automatically post feedback and start dunning procedures for customers ordering via eBay.

Incoming orders are collected in one menu and displayed in a consistent format so that you can easily <<orders/managing-orders#1500, manage these orders>>. Each order receives an individual *order ID*. Additional steps taking place after incoming orders, such as sending the order confirmation, sending emails or generating <<orders/order-documents#, order documents>>, can be automated. In addition to main orders representing orders placed by customers, several other *order types* exist in plentymarkets. Order types represent different business transactions.
