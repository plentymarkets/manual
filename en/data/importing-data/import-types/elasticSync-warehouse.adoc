[IMPORTANT]
.Requirements
====
In order to create or update storage locations via the import, a warehouse has to be created beforehand. +
====

[TIP]
.Practical example: Adjusting storage locations
====
Now and then, the data of storage locations has to be adjusted. How to export warehouse data, adjust the data accordingly and import it back into the system is explained step by step in <<data/importing-data/elasticsync-best-practices/best-practices-elasticsync-storage-locations#, this practical example>>.

== Adjusting storage locations

You can adjust storage locations via ElasticSync and for example change the name or the position of the storage location.

[.instruction]
Adjusting storage locations:

. Go to *Data » Import*.
. Click on the sync in the sync overview. +
→ The settings open.
. Switch to the *Matching* tab.
. Activate the field *Warehouse Location ID*.
. Select one of the *Import options*.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.
. Click on *Mapping*.
. Open the mapping from the overview.
. Expand the area *Warehouse location* on the right-hand side.
. Activate the fields *Storage location name* and *Position*.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

[#2250]
== Creating storage locations

You can use ElasticSync to create new storage locations. Note that the structure of the warehouse has to be defined beforehand which means that at least one storage location already has to exist.

[.instruction]
Creating storage locations:

. Go to *Data » Import*.
. Click on the sync in the sync overview. +
→ The settings open.
. Switch to the *Matching* tab.
. Select the field *Level ID*.
. Select one of the *Import options*.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.
. Click on *Mapping*.
. Open the mapping from the overview.
. Activate the lines in which the values *Storage location name*, *Purpose*, *Position* and *Status* can be found and select the respective source.
. Expand the area *Warehouse location* on the right-hand side and map the fields *Storage location name*, *Purpose*, *Position* and *Status*. The *Storage location ID* is optional - if not selected, the next highest ID is automatically assigned.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

[#2250]
== Deleting storage locations

You can delete storage locations with ElasticSync. This only applies to storage locations without stock.

[.instruction]
Deleting storage locations:

. Go to *Data » Import*.
. Click on the sync in the sync overview. +
→ The settings open.
. Switch to the *Matching* tab.
. Select the field *Warehouse Location ID*.
. Select one of the *Import options*.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.
. Click on *Mapping*.
. Open the mapping from the overview.
. Expand the area *Warehouse location* on the right-hand side.
. Activate the field *Delete storage location*.
. You can either delete all storage locations or only specific ones. Carry out the respective settings. Pay attention to the explanations given in <<table-deleting-storage-locations>>.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

[[table-deleting-storage-locations]]
.Deleting all storage locations or only specific ones
[cols="1,3"]
|====
|Setting |Explanation

|Deleting all storage locations
|All storage location IDs that exist in the CSV file will be deleted. +
 For the Delete storage location value, select *Own value*. +
 Then select *Yes* or *No*.

|Deleting only specific storage locations
|Here, the CSV file contains two values: on the one hand there are the storage location IDs and on the other hand there are the values *Yes* and *No* by which you can determine whether the value should be deleted.
