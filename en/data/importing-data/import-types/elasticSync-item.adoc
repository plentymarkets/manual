This page explains the matching and mapping fields that you can use while importing item and variation data. This page serves purely as a reference and it assumes that you already have a basic understanding of the <<data/importing-data/ElasticSync#, import tool>>.

[IMPORTANT]
.Requirements
====
In order to import item data via the import tool, the following data records must be present in plentymarkets:

* Categories (*Item » Category* menu)
* Sales prices (*Setup » Item » Sales prices* menu)

In order to import variation data with attributes via the import tool, the following data records must be present in plentymarkets:

* Attributes and attribute values (*Setup » Item » Attributes* menu)
====

[TIP]
.Practical example: Importing new items
====
Imagine you’re new to plentymarkets and you want to import all of your items and variations at once. How would that work? Take a look at <<data/importing-data/elasticsync-best-practices/best-practices-elasticsync-creating-variations#, this practical example>>, which guides you through the process step-by-step.

[#1910]
== Fields for item matching

<<table-matching-fields-item>> explains the fields that are available for matching item data. During the import, plentymarkets checks if the imported data record already exists based on the matching field.

[[table-matching-fields-item]]
.Matching fields for importing items
[cols="1,3"]
|====
|Matching field |Explanation

|Variation ID
|

|Variation no.
|

|External variation ID
|

|Barcode
|Select the <<item/settings/barcodes#100, barcode type>> from the second drop-down list.

|Item ID
|For variations with attributes, use this field only in combination with attribute selection combination.


|Attribute selection combination
|For variations with attributes, use this field only in combination with the item ID.
Select the format from the second drop-down list that contains the data of the file.

|Supplier item No.

[#1920]
== Fields for the item mapping

//since there are many different fields, the explainations have been divided into sub-chapters.
This chapter explains the fields that are available for mapping item and variation data.

Many different mapping fields are available for the *Item* import type. As such, the following explanations have been divided into sub-chapters.

[TIP]
.No mapping field? Default value applies!
====
If you don’t include a certain piece of information in your CSV file, i.e. if you _don’t use_ a certain mapping field, then your item or variation will be given the default value.

=== Item
//evtl Tab Global und aaaa und bbbb anstatt die obere Tab-Leiste

<<table-mapping-fields-items>> explains the fields that are available for mapping various _item data_.
These mapping fields correspond, e.g. to the tabs <<item/managing-items#40, Global>>, <<item/managing-items#45, Multi-Channel>> and <<item/managing-items#70, Fields>> within the <<item/introduction/structure#200, upper row of tabs>> in an item data record.

Enter one of the permitted import values into your CSV file. Which value you choose determines how the setting will be configured when it’s imported.

In other words: If you open the item data record once it’s been imported, then you’ll see that the settings in the upper row of tabs were configured as follows.

Applies a price calculation to whichever prices were saved for the variation. In other words, it corresponds to the _third_ drop-down list under: +
<<item/managing-items#240, Tab: Variation ID » Tab: Settings » Area: Sales prices>>

Data is mapped according to the price calculation ID in the menu *Setup » Item » Calculation » Open price calculation*.

|Price calculation UUID
|Alphanumeric
| - n/a -
a|icon:warning[role="red"] [red]#New price calculation#

Enter a price calculation's UUID into the CSV file.
This applies the calculation to the variation's prices.

*_Tip_*: You can copy the price calculation UUID.
Open the menu *Item » Price calculation » [Open price calculation]*.
Click on the UUID in the lower left corner.
The UUID is copied to the clipboard.

*_Import the price calculation UUID last_*:
Imagine your prices are calculated with the following formula: `(PurchasePrice + TransportCosts) * 1.07`.
In this case, import the purchase price and transportation costs first and then the price caluclation second.
Otherwise plentymarkets won't have all of the information it needs to correctly calculate the price.

. <<data/importing-data/ElasticSync#1500, Create a mapping>>, which imports the purchase price and transportation costs.
. <<data/importing-data/ElasticSync#1500, Create another mapping>> in the same import. Use this one to import the price calculation UUID. +
→ The mappings are processed one after the other.

You can find the result of the import in the back end menu: <<item/managing-items#240, Item » Edit item » [Open variation] » Tab: Settings » Area: Sales prices>>

*_Note_*: Only one price calculation can be linked to a variation.
Imagine you've already linked a price calculation to a variation.
Then you link a second price calculation to the same variation.
In this case, the second price calculation would overwrite the first one.
Both price calculations can not simultaneously be linked to the variation.
Nonetheless, it's still possible to calculate prices differently, e.g. in the plentyShop and on Amazon.
This is done by adding <<item/settings/prices#1500, multiple calculation building blocks>> to your price calculation.
