A sync of the type *Note* allows you to import notes. Depending on the matching field you select, the notes are either saved for contacts, variations, orders or categories.

[#10]
== Fields for matching

<<table-matching-fields-notes>> explains the fields that are available for matching notes. During the import, plentymarkets checks if the imported data record already exists based on the matching field. The matching field you select determines the type of data record the note is assigned to during import. As such, you need to create separate syncs for each type of note.
