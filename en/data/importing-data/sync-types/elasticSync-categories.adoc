Example 1: Price and stock synchronisation of a variation.

Create a sync to keep prices and stock of a variation up-to-date. Once the assignment for the sync took place, a mapping has to be created. To do so, select the plentymarkets fields VariationSalesPrice and VariationStock within the Select values area of the mapping. Next, select the sales prices (price, RRP) which should be updated for VariationSalesPrice. It is possible to update several different sales prices with one sync. Now link the filed of the data source. Not only can you select the warehouse for the stock but also the storage location. For VariationStock, select the warehouse for which stock should be booked. Optionally, select the storage location. To use the quantity from the data source, link the plentymarkets field quantity with the field of the data source. A stock correction is always carried out in the process.

Example 2: Importing item descriptions

Name, technical data and meta keywords should be imported for an item. First, select these plentymarkets fields within the Select values area of the mapping. Next, you have to select the language for this item descriptions. You can select more than one option. The fields Name, Technical data and Meta keywords are linked with the desired fields of the data source. This means that the entries listed in the data source will be now imported for the previously selected plentymarkets fields. In addition, use the filter options to further specify the import. For example, import the item descriptions only for items that belong to a specific brand.
