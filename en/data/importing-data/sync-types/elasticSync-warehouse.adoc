== Fields for storage location matching

<<table-matching-fields-storage-locations>> explains the fields that are available for matching storage locations. During the import, plentymarkets checks if the imported data record already exists based on the matching field.

For further information on the terms dimensions, levels and storage locations, refer to the link:https://knowledge.plentymarkets.com/en/stock-management/setting-up-a-warehouse[Setting up a warehouse^] page of the manual.
