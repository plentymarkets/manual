This data is for example the delivery address and invoice address, the date of birth of the contact, the customer type, contact options such as the private or business email address as well as company data.

[TIP]
.Requirements for importing countries of delivery

In order that the newly imported or updated countries of delivery are displayed in a contact data record in the contact overview, these countries of delivery must be activated in the *System » Orders » Shipping » Options » Tab: Countries of delivery* menu.

* Contacts (*CRM » Contacts* menu)
