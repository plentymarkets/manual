With syncs of the type *Contacts, companies and addresses*, you import new contact data or update existing data records. This data is for example the delivery address and invoice address, the date of birth of the contact, the customer type, contact options such as the private or business email address as well as company data.

Requirements:

* In order that the newly imported or updated countries of delivery are displayed in a contact data record in the contact overview, these countries of delivery must be activated in the *System » System settings » Orders » Shipping » Options » Tab: Countries of delivery* menu.

In order to import contact data via ElasticSync, the following data records must be present in plentymarkets:

* Contacts (*CRM » Contacts* menu)
* contact options such as telephone number and email address, if necessary
* address data (invoice address, delivery address), if necessary
* company data such as VAT number and payment due date, if necessary
