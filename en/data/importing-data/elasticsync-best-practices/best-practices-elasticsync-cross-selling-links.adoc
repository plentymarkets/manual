== Exporting and importing cross-selling links

This chapter describes how to export and import cross-selling links.

NOTE: To benefit from this best practice, you should be familiar the basic functionality of ElasticSync. Check the <<data/importing-data/ElasticSync#, Importing data with ElasticSync>> page of the manual for general information about how the plugin works.

[#export_CrossSelling]
=== Exporting cross-selling links

==== Creating the format in the FormatDesigner

The currently linked cross-selling items can be exported using the FormatDesigner.

To do so, go to *Data » FormatDesigner* and create a new format of the type *Item*.

After that, select the data fields:

* To allow mapping during import, from the *Item* area select the *ID* of the item or from the *Variation* area select the *ID* or the *Number* of the variation.

* The actual cross-selling links are added in the *ItemCrossSelling* area. The field *all* returns all linked cross-selling items in the format *ItemID:Type:IsDynamic*.

After you have saved the format, you can set up the export in the elastic export.

==== Setting up the export in the elastic export

Go to *Data » Elastic export* to set up the export of the format you created.

To do so, click on *New export* and save a name, the type *Item*, the format you created, a limit and a file name.

[TIP]
.Exporting the file in CSV format
====
If you want to download the file in CSV format, specify the suffix *.csv* as part of the file name.
====

Once you save the format, you are done setting it up.

==== Exporting data

There are several ways of exporting the data:

* In the export, click *Download*.
* Open the URL in a browser.
* In the export overview, click *Download*.

[#Import_CrossSelling]
=== Importing cross-selling links

==== Creating the format in ElasticSync

To import the cross-selling links, you can go to *Data » ElasticSync* and create a sync of the type *Item*. Alternatively, you can add the fields to an existing sync.

* The synchronisation can be based on a variation-specific field, for example the *Variation number*, or based on the item ID if the links are imported using a separate sync.

* In the sync’s mapping, in the *Cross-selling* are, link the field *Add cross-selling links* and assign the corresponding column in the CSV file.

* You can save more than one cross-selling link per row. The structure will be as follows:

*ItemID:Type;ItemID2:Type2*

* Use the field *Delete all cross-selling links* to delete all links of an item. Specify 1 for yes, 0 for no. This is a good idea if, for example, you want to update your cross-selling items.

* Using the field *Delete cross-selling links*, you can delete one or more item IDs. The format should look like this:

*itemID;itemID;etc*

That is all you need for the link. The sync is now ready to go and you can start linking or unlinking cross-selling items.
