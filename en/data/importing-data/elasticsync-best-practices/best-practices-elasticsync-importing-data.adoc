These Best Practices will demonstrate how to import data with the new ElasticSync. Before using these Best Practices to transfer data, familiarise yourself with the functions of the link:https://knowledge.plentymarkets.com/en/data/exporting-data/FormatDesigner[FormatDesigner] and the link:https://knowledge.plentymarkets.com/en/data/exporting-data/elastic-export[Elastic Export] and read the corresponding manual pages. +

In the following section we will show you how to import data with ElasticSync. +

== Processing data

The CSV file that has been created via Elastic Export can be opened in a spreadsheet programme.

The data fields level, label, purpose, status, position, type and notes can be imported. +

In this example the values of the position and of the notes have been changed.

== Importing data with the new ElasticSync

In the following section we will exemplarily create a Sync of the type Warehouse.

. Go to *Data » ElasticSync New*. +
→ The overview opens.
. Click on *Add Sync*. +
→ The overview opens.
. Carry out the settings. Pay attention to the information given in <<table-settings-elasticsync>>.
*Save* the settings. +
→ The Sync has been saved.

.Add Sync
[cols="2,2"]
|====
|Settings |Explanation

|*Name*
|Name of the Sync

|*Type*
|Select which data fields can be assigned to the import data. In this example we use the type Warehouse.

|*Data type*
|So far, CSV is the only available data type.

|*Separator*
|The separator separates the different data types. Here, we use the separator semicolon.

|*Source*
|The CSV file is deposited in the source.
In this example we use the data upload, which will soon be available as own option field.

We use a local CSV file for the data upload. In this case, we select HTTP as source and data upload as HTTP option.
In order to open the file manager click on *Select file*.

=== Matching

For the matching, the data have to be determined and assigned. This enables to find out which data of the file correspond to which data in plentymarkets.

[[image-importing-data]]
.Matching
image::basics/data-exchange/ElasticSync/assets/matching.png[]

With the matching you determine by which data it is examined whether a data set already exists.
In this example we use the Warehouse Location ID for the matching.

=== Import options

Here is specified whether only new data, only existing data or both data types should be imported.

. Click on the field *Mapping*. +
→ The overview opens.
. Click on the plus *Add mapping.*
. Select a name.
. *Save* the settings. +
→ The mapping has been created.

=== Assigning data fields

The data to be imported have to be assigned to the plentymarkets data fields.

. Click on *+Field*. +
→ The overview of the import data and of the plentymarkets data fields opens.
. Click in the field *Target* and select the corresponding data field.
. Click on *Activate row* to activate the import data.
. *Save* the settings.
