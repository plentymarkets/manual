== Best Practice: Importing package numbers from fulfilment service providers

This chapter describes how you can use *ElasticSync* to import package numbers for orders that are processed by your fulfilment service providers into your plentymarkets system.

It makes sense to use a CSV file containing the order ID as well as the respective package number as a source file. Your fulfilment service provider usually provides you with such a file.

=== Creating the sync in ElasticSync

To import the package numbers, go to *Data » ElasticSync* and create a new sync of the type *Order*.

[TIP]
.Creating a new sync
====
To ensure effective cooperation with your fulfilment service provider, we recommend that you create a separate sync for importing package numbers and only use this sync for this purpose. If the fields described below are added to an existing sync, wrong matching and malfunctions are likely to occur.
====

* It is mandatory that the matching is carried out via the *Order ID*. It is not necessary to add further matching fields.

* Add a new *Mapping* for the package number. Select the mapping field *Package number* as well as the option *Standard package*.

* Use the *Edit* function within the *Standard package* mapping to select the name of the column whose values should be imported from the source file.

* *Save* the settings.

After carrying out and saving the settings, go to *Sync » Mapping* and test the sync. Once the *package number* has been successfully imported, it is displayed in the *Settings* tab of the respective order.
