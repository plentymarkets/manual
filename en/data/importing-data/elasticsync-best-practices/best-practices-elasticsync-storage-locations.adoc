This page offers Best Practices for importing and exporting data. Before you use these Best Practices in order to exchange data, familiarise yourself with the functions of the FormatDesigner, the Elastic Export and ElasticSync. To do so, read the pages link:https://knowledge.plentymarkets.com/en/data/exporting-data/FormatDesigner[Creating data formats with FormatDesigner], link:https://knowledge.plentymarkets.com/en/data/exporting-data/elastic-export[Elastic Export] and link:https://knowledge.plentymarkets.com/en/data/importing-data/ElasticSync[Importing data with ElasticSync].

== Exporting data
In the first section of the Best Practices we will focus on the data export. First, we will show you how to create and assign data fields by using the FormatDesigner.

=== Creating and assigning data fields with the FormatDesigner

In the menu under *Data » FormatDesigner* you can create data formats for the export. In order to use it, the ElasticSync plugin has to be installed. In the following section we exemplarily create a template for storage location and thus for the data format WarehouseLocation. It contains all data fields that directly concern the storage location.

[[table-settings-data-fields]]
.Data fields WarehouseLocation
[cols=”1,3”]
|====
|Setting |Explanation

|*ID*
|The ID of a storage location is unique, as a new one is assigned to every storage location.

|*LevelID*
|ID of the level on which the storage location is located.

|*Label*
|Here you can enter a name for the storage location label.

|*Purpose*
|Purpose of the storage location, e.g. removal from storage

|*Status*
|Status of the storage location, e.g. active, inactive

|*Position*
|Position of the storage location (pick path)

|*Fullabel*
|Name of the storage location

|*Type*
|Type of the storage location, e.g. small, medium, large

|*Notes*
|Here you can make notes regarding the storage location
|====

In our example we use the FormatDesigner to create a sync of the type Warehouse and name it warehouseLocation.

.Data fields WarehouseLocation

By clicking on the data fields they are added to the template. +
*Save* the settings.

This leads to the following assignment in the FormatDesigner.

=== Exporting data with the Elastic Export

The Elastic Export allows you to export the templates that have been created in the FormatDesigner into the CSV format. If no Elastic Export can be created the plugin on plentyMarketplace has to be installed first.

==== Creating a new export

In the menu under *Data » ElasticSync* you can create a new export.

. Open the menu *Data » ElasticSync*. +
→ The overview opens.
. Click on *New export*.
. Carry out the settings. Pay attention to the information given in <<table-settings-new-export>>.
. *Save* the settings.
. Refresh the token once again.
. Click on *Download file*. +
→ The created CSV file can be edited in a spreadsheet programme.
. Once the data have been edited the file has to be saved under a new name.

|====
|Setting |Explanation

|*Name*
|Insert a name. Under this name the export format appears in the overview of the *Exports* tab.

|*Type*
|From the drop-down list, select the data type that you want to export. Here we select the type warehouse.

|*Format*
|From the drop-down list, select the format for the export. Only formats that have been installed from the plentyMarketplace are available.

|*Limit*
|Enter a number. It is limited to 10,000 data records.

|*Provisioning*
|Select *URL*, *FTP* or *Admin area*. Different settings appear depending on which option is selected. Here we select the option *URL*.

|*Token*
|If you have selected the option *URL* under *Provisioning*, then click on *Generate token*. The token is entered automatically.

|*Filter*
|For the filter we select the option warehouse.

== Processing data

In a next step the data are processed. The CSV file that has been created per Elastic Export can be opened in a spreadsheet programme.

[[image-importing-data]]
.CSV file data unprocessed
image::data/assets/csv-file-data-unprocessed.png[]

The data fields level, label, purpose, status, position, type and notes can be imported. +
In the given example we changed the values of the position and of the notes.

== Importing data with ElasticSync

In the next section we will deal with importing data with ElasticSync. We will exemplarily create a sync of the type Warehouse.

. Go to *Data » ElasticSync*. +
→ The overview opens.
. Click on *Add sync*. +
→ The overview opens.
. Carry out the settings. Pay attention to the information given in <<table-create-sync>>.
. *Save* the settings. +
→ The sync has been saved.

[[table-create-sync]]
.Creating a sync
[cols="1,3"]
|====
|Setting |Explanation

|*Name*
|Name of the sync

|*Type*
|Select which data fields can be assigned to the import data. In this example we select the type warehouse.

|*Data type*
|So far the only available data type is CSV.

|*Separator*
|The separator separates the different data types. In this example we use the separator semicolon.

|*Source*
|The CSV file is deposited in the source. In this example we use the data upload which will soon be available as own option field.

The data upload is next, for which we use a local CSV file. In this case we select HTTP as source and data upload as HTTP option.

. Click on *Select file* to open the *file manager*.
. Click on *Update file* to provide a new file.
. Select the CSV file from the file manager.
. Click on *Open*. +
→ The file is saved in the list under My files.
. Tick the box and select the file. +
→ The file is loaded into the source directory.
. *Save* the settings.

=== Matching

For the matching it is necessary to determine and assign the data in order to figure out which data of the file correspond to which data in plentymarkets.

[[image-importing-data]]
.Matching
image::data/assets/matching.png[]

With the matching you determine by which data it is examined whether a data record already exists. +
In this example the WarehouseLocation ID is used for the matching.

[[image-importing-data]]
.Select matching

=== Import options

Here it is determined whether only new data, only existing data or new as well as existing data should be imported.

*Save* the settings.

=== Creating a mapping

In the mapping the imported data are assigned to the plentymarkets data fields.

At first a mapping needs to be created.

. Click on the field *Mapping* +
→ The overview opens.
. Click on the plus *Add mapping*.
