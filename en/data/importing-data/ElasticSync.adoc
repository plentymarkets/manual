This page of the manual describes how to import data using ElasticSync. Importing data is recommended if you want to add new items, customer data or stock etc. to your plentymarkets system and you already have this data available in digital format. ElasticSync allows to carry out data imports by creating so-called syncs. You can import your data manually or automatically. Watch this video and learn about the basics for importing data with ElasticSync.

== Assigning user rights for back end users

Users of the type *Back end* can only access limited areas and menus in the plentymarkets back end. Thus, their access to the system is limited. If users of this type should be able to work with syncs and mappings, a user of the type *Admin* has to assign the rights listed in <<table-user-rights-elasticsync>> to those users.

[.instruction]
Assigning user rights for back end users:

. Go to *Setup » Settings » User » Rights » User*.
. Use the search function (icon:search[role="blue"]) and open the user account that should be edited.
. In the *Authorisations* section, activate the rights as listed in <<table-user-rights-elasticsync>>.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

== Creating a sync

The steps for creating and importing syncs are identical for all sync types. As such, the steps described in the following apply to all sync types.

Go to **Data » ElasticSync** to create, edit and manage syncs. Here, you can see an overview of all syncs. With a sync, you can assign the data of a file that is accessible via FTP or HTTPS to the data in plentymarkets and import them. When creating a sync, you save information about the data source. Furthermore, it is important that you determine data for the matching and that you assign which data of your file corresponds to the data in plentymarkets. Use the matching to set what data is to be used to try to identify, if a data record already exists or not. Use the mapping to set which column in your file corresponds to which data field in plentymarkets. In the end, set an import interval. Proceed as described below to create a sync.

[NOTE]
.Set the import interval in the end to avoid that a sync is carried out too early
====
It is recommended to set the import interval in the end. By doing so, you avoid that a sync is already carried out while you still carry out matching and mapping settings.
====

[.instruction]
Creating a sync:

. Go to *Data » ElasticSync*. +
→ The sync overview opens.
. Click on *Add sync* (icon:plus-square[role="green"]). +
→ The editing area *New sync* is displayed.
. Carry out the settings. Pay attention to the explanations given in <<table-create-sync>>.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings. +
→ The sync is created. +
→ The matching settings of the sync open.

== Setting the import options

The import options can be found in the *Matching* area. They apply both for the matching and for the mapping.

Before we get to the specific settings of the import options you now have the opportunity to learn more about the data import by watching the following videos.
As already mentioned, data can be imported manually or automatically. If you are new to plentymarkets and you want to manually import your data one time, watch this video and learn how to initially transfer product or customer data into your system.

.Manually import you data one time

|Import option |Explanation

|*Select an import option*
a|

* *Import new data, update existing* = If data can be found by means of the matching fields, a new data record, e.g. a new item or a new order, is added. At the same time, existing data is updated.
* *Only update existing data* = Existing data is updated. If no data can be found by means of the matching fields, the data record is not imported.
* *Only import new data* = Only new data records are imported, i.e. any data for which no matching data is found based on the synchronisation fields.

|*Decimal number*
a|Select *German spelling* or *English spelling*.

* *German spelling* = Decimal numbers are separated by a comma and a full stop serves as thousands separator.
* *English spelling* = Decimal numbers are separated by a full stop and a comma serves as thousands separator.

|*Date format*
|Enter the date format. If the date in the file corresponds to the standard format Y-m-d H:i:s, it is not necessary to enter another format. Other formats, however, must be entered here. All link:http://php.net/manual/de/function.date.php[php-compliant date formats^] are allowed.

|====

[#1400]
== Setting the matching

After creating a sync, open it to carry out further settings. First, select the fields that should be used for matching the data. Determine what should happen if no existing data can be found during the matching process.

[NOTE]
.Matching is optional
====
Matching fields are optional settings. If you do not select a matching field, the data in your file cannot be assigned to existing data in your system. You can determine one, multiple or all matching fields. The displayed matching fields are different for each sync type.
====

[.instruction]
Setting the matching:

. Go to *Data » ElasticSync*. +
→ The sync overview opens.
. Click on the sync in the sync overview. +
→ The settings open.
. Switch to the *Matching* tab.
. Carry out the settings.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

[#1500]
== Creating a mapping

With a mapping, you specify which column of your file corresponds to which data field in your system. Without this mapping, no data can be imported.

[.instruction]
Determining the mapping:

. Go to *Data » ElasticSync*. +
→ The sync overview opens.
. Click on the sync in the sync overview. +
→ The settings open.
. Switch to the *Matching* tab.
. Click on *Add mapping* (icon:plus-square[role="green"]).
. Enter a name for the mapping.
. Enter a position for the mapping (optional).
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings. +
→ The available mapping fields differ according to the sync type.
. Select the data fields for the mapping by placing a checkmark in the fields. +
→ The selected data fields are added to the mapping.
. Select a column from your file for each data field or select the option *Own value*.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.


You want to import a file into plentymarkets, but it's missing a few key pieces of information? No need to modify the file by hand! This video shows you how to use ElasticSync’s "Own Value" function to add missing information to your sync.

.Use the Own value to add missing information to your file
video::329761403[vimeo]

[NOTE]
.Own value
====
The option *Own value* allows to import a fix value for the data field. This fixed value is thus identical for each data record that is imported via this sync.
====

[NOTE]
.Mathematical calculations
====
In the mapping overview, select the option *Mathematical calculations* in order to adjust values in a CSV or TXT file during the import. The options addition (+++), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/) and the adaptation of percentages (+)/(-) are available. The value that is being adapted in the CSV or TXT column must be a number.
====

[#1510]
=== Activating lines of a mapping for the import

In the *Mapping* section, you can activate all lines for the import with just one click. Alternatively, you can decide individually for each line whether you want it to be active or inactive, thus, whether it should be considered in the import or not.

[.instruction]
Activating lines for the import:

. Go to *Data » ElasticSync*. +
→ The sync overview opens.
. Click on a sync. +
→ The settings open.
. Switch to the *Matching* tab.
. Click on a mapping. +
→ The mapping opens.
. On the left, click on *Activate all* in order to consider all lines in the import.
. Alternatively, select a line and click on *Activate line* in order to just consider this line in the import.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

[NOTE]
.View of the mapping
====
On the left side of the mapping you can see the import data of the CSV or TXT file that have to be mapped on the plentymarkets page. The plentymarkets data fields are shown on the right. The preview (icon:eye[role="blue"]) displays the first 6 values of the file.
====

[#1520]
=== Replacing values with the RegEx function

In order to consider a CSV or TXT file during the import as desired, the so-called RegEx function (Regular Expression) can be applied. Thanks to this function, data is manipulated during the import by using commands, so that the CSV or TXT file does not need to be changed anymore. Watch this video to learn more about the RegEx function.

.Modify your data with the RegEx function
video::329761682[vimeo]

The following two examples will give an overview of the process.

*Example 1*: +
*Input*: “24.12.2017” +
*Search pattern*\: /^(\\d+).(\\d+).(\\d+)$/ +
*Replace pattern*\: $3﹣$2﹣$1 +
*Result*: “2017-12-24”

*Example 2*: +
*Input*: “Doe, John” +
*Search pattern*\: /^(\\w+), (\\w+)$/ ++), (\\w+)$/ +
*Replace pattern*\: $2 $1 + +
*Result*: “John Doe” +

*Explanation of the examples*: +
Right at the beginning, there is the input. In a first step, the pattern to be searched for is inserted as search pattern. Afterwards, it is changed accordingly in the replace pattern, so that it is output during the import as required. Finally, the result is output as desired and will be considered in the CSV or TXT file.

[.instruction]
Replacing values:

. Go to *Data » ElasticSync*. +
→ The sync overview opens.
. Click on a sync. +
→ The settings open.
. Switch to the *Matching* tab.
. Click on a mapping. +
→ The mapping opens.
. In the field *Source*, select the value *Regular expression*. +
→ The options for *Regular expression* open.
. In the field *Value*, enter the column name of the CSV or TXT file (e.g. Package number, Order ID etc.).
. In the field *Search*, enter the Search pattern.
. In the field *Replace*, enter the Replace pattern.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings. +
→ The data fields are updated.

[NOTE]
.Info about RegEx
====
For further information on RegEx see link:http://php.net/manual/en/reference.pcre.pattern.syntax.php[this^] page or have a look link:https://regexr.com/[here^].
On the latter page, the RegEx engine setting has to be changed to PCRE. This can be done in the dropdown menu on the top right where Javascript is preset.
====

[#1520]
=== Own assignment

With the own assignment you can assign existing values of a CSV or TXT file to other values in the system. This enables to define, which value is supposed to be imported for which ID. In addition, for values in the CSV or TXT file that are not assigned, you can specify a default value. If no default value is specified, the original value is imported.

[.instruction]
Defining an own assignment:

. Go to *Data » ElasticSync*. +
→ The sync overview opens.
. Click on a sync. +
→ The settings open.
. Switch to the *Matching* tab.
. Click on a mapping. +
→ The mapping opens.
. In the dropdown menu of the *Source* field, select the option *Own assignment*.
. Fill in the fields. Pay attention to the explanations given in <<table-own-assignment>>.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

[[table-own-assignment]]
.Own assignment
[cols="1,3"]
|====
|*Field* |*Setting*

|*Type*
|Name of the CSV or TXT column (e.g. Delivery country)

|*Default value*
|Value, in case no assignment was found (e.g. 1)

|*From*
|Original value in the CSV or TXT file (e.g. DE for Germany)

|*To*
|Value, to which the original value shall be mapped (e.g. 1 for DE, 10 for GB etc.)
|====

[#1530]
=== Manipulating an import file via the own assignment

In the following section we will demonstrate the usage of the own assignment shown by the example of *Activating a shipping profile*. +
To do so, an item/a variation as well as a shipping profile has to exist. The following video gives you an introduction on how the Own assignment works.

.Use the Own assignment to trade one piece of information for another
video::329761532[vimeo]

[[image-importing-data]]
.Shipping profile
image::data/importing-data/assets/en-elasticsync-shipping-profile.png[]

In order to link an item/a variation to a shipping profile, the ID is required. Just the name of the shipping profile shown in the import file is not sufficient to create a link.

[[image-importing-data]]
.Item ID
image::data/importing-data/assets/en-elasticsync-item-id.png[]

Use the own assignment in ElasticSync, which manipulates the data during the import. As source for the import data, select the value *Own assignment*.

[[image-importing-data]]
.Own assignment
image::data/importing-data/assets/en-elasticsync-own-assignment.png[]

For *type*, select the column from the import file. In this case, it is the column *Shipping profile*.

[[image-importing-data]]
.Select the file format of the import file
image::data/importing-data/assets/en-elasticsync-type.png[]

Determine which value in the import file shall be changed to which value in order to successfully carry out the import. In this case, DPD shall be changed to the ID of the shipping profile (here ID 7). You can also do this for several shipping profiles by adding further own assignments.
Afterwards, carry out the import. The shipping profile is linked.

[[image-importing-data]]
.Determining a value
image::data/importing-data/assets/en-elasticsync-determine-value.png[]

The own assignment can be used for many other cases. This applies in particular where internal IDs of plentymarkets play a role (e.g. characteristic names, item flags, payment methods, country ISO codes etc.).

[#1600]
== Filtering import data

You can use filters to limit the imported data. You find the filters in the *Mapping* area.

[NOTE]
.Multiple filters are linked with an AND condition
====
If you use multiple filters, only those data records that apply to all filters are imported. Thus, the filters are linked with an AND condition.
====

[.instruction]
Adding a filter:

. Go to *Data » ElasticSync*. +
→ The sync overview opens.
. Click on the sync in the sync overview. +
→ The settings open.
. Switch to the *Matching* tab.
. Click on a mapping. +
→ The mapping opens.
. Click on *Filter* (icon:filter[role="yellow"]) in the toolbar.
. Select the column from your file that you want to filter.
. Select an operator.
. Enter a value.
. Click on *Add filter* (icon:plus-square[role="green"]). +
→ The filter is saved.
. Add additional filters as necessary. +
→ Only data that meets all filter criteria is imported.


//[#1620]
//== Report of sync import

//A report is available in the overview of a sync. This report shows all imported rows including the success and error messages, which can be opened by clicking on the *Message* column. Use the filter in order to retrieve specific sync data.

[#1625]
== Viewing success and error messages of syncs

In the *Data » Log* menu you can see success and error messages of syncs. To find messages of specific syncs, select the reference type *elasticSyncId* or *elasticSyncName* and enter the respective reference value. The specific success or error messages can be found in the *Message* column.

[NOTE]
.Successful import
====
If a sync has been imported successfully, the entry in the *Processing status/Last import* column is displayed in green. If errors occurred during the import, the entry is displayed in red.
====

[#1630]
== Copying syncs

You can copy one sync or multiple syncs at the same time. That way, you can use syncs that you have already configured in order to quickly create a new sync.

[.instruction]
Copying syncs:

. Go to *Data » ElasticSync*. +
→ The sync overview opens.
. Select one or multiple syncs.
. Click on *Copy sync*. +
→ The sync is copied. *(copy)* is added behind a copied sync.

[#1640]
== Importing and exporting a sync

You can import and export syncs. Furthermore, you can save syncs locally and import syncs from other users.
This video shows how to use preconfigured syncs in order to safe time when importing data.

.Import and export your syncs
video::336295238[vimeo]
[.instruction]

→ The sync has been imported successfully.

[NOTE]
.Importing syncs from another plentymarkets system
====
If you would like to import syncs from another plentymarkets system, you have to adjust the matching and mapping settings. It is only possible to import *.json* files.
====

[NOTE]
.Importing and updating syncs
====
If you want to import and update a sync, a mapping and a matching are required. Otherwise, it is not possible to test or run a sync. In order to save the sync, a data field has to be activated in the mapping overview. +
If you just want to import a sync, a mapping alone is sufficient.
====

[#1650]
== Uploading files quickly and easily

In order to quickly and easily upload files, you can use the upload button in the *File name* column.

[.instruction]
Uploading files quickly and easily:

. Go to *Data » ElasticSync*. +
→ The sync overview opens.
. In the *File Name* column, click on the button *Upload file* (icon:upload[role="purple"]). +
→ Your files open.
. Select a file and click on *Open*. +
→ The file is uploaded and the file name is displayed in the column. After running the sync, the file name disappears.

[#1700]
== Testing the sync and importing data

It is possible to test and carry out syncs. Testing allows you to quickly know whether your file can be imported correctly.

[NOTE]
.Testing the sync
====
If you select *Test sync*, only the first ten lines of the import file are imported.
====

[#1710]
== Processing jobs in the queue

The queue enables the import of large amounts of data. Before being imported, the import file is broken down into packages and processed in so-called jobs. A job consists of 750 lines of a CSV or TXT file. However, import files with less than 750 lines also make a job. Whenever a sync is started, the file is split up into the respective jobs and is put into the queue. In the queue, new jobs are permanently retrieved and the syncs are processed. There are two different statuses. The status *Open jobs* means that there are jobs in the queue waiting to be processed. *Completed* jobs on the contrary have already been processed and the data have been imported.

[#1720]
== Activating/deactivating mappings

If you manage several mappings in the same sync, you can deactivate or activate specific mappings of the sync in the mapping overview by clicking on the toggle button in the column *Active/Inactive*. New mappings are active by default.

[#1730]
== Restoring backups of syncs

If you want to reset sync data to a previous state or restore deleted sync data, you can do so by using the backup function.

[.instruction]
Restoring backups of syncs:

. Go to *Setup » Settings » Data » Backup*. +
→ The backup overview opens.
. In the line of the backup that you want to import, click on *Restore backup* (icon:upload[role="purple"]) on the right.
. At the top, select *Partially import data base* and tick the box *ElasticSync*.
. Click on *Restore backup*. +
→ The backup is restored.
