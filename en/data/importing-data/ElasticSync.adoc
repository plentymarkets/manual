:description: Find out how to import data in plentymarkets using ElasticSync.
:position: 10

This page of the manual describes how to import data using ElasticSync. Importing data is recommended if you want to add new items, customer data or stock etc. to your plentymarkets system and you already have this data available in digital format. ElasticSync allows to carry out data imports by creating so-called syncs. You can import your data manually or automatically.

[#1210]
== Creating a sync

The steps for creating and importing syncs are identical for all sync types. As such, the steps described in the following apply to all sync types.

Go to **Data » ElasticSync** to create, edit and manage syncs. Here, you can see an overview of all syncs. With a sync, you can assign the data of a file that is accessible via FTP or HTTP to the data in plentymarkets and import them. When creating a sync, you save information about the data source. Furthermore, it is important that you determine data for the matching and that you assign which data of your file corresponds to the data in plentymarkets. Use the matching to set what data is to be used to try to identify if a data record already exists or not. Use the mapping to set which column in your file corresponds to which data field in plentymarkets. In the end, set an import interval. Proceed as described below to create a sync.

[NOTE]
.Set the import interval in the end to avoid that a sync is carried out too early
====
It is recommended to set the import interval in the end. By doing so, you avoid that a sync is already carried out while you still carry out matching and mapping settings.
====

== Setting the import options

The import options can be found in the *Matching* area. The import options apply both for the matching and for the mapping.

[.instruction]
Setting the import options:

. Go to *Data » ElasticSync*.
. Click on the sync within the sync overview.
. Click on *Matching*.
. Determine the import options. Pay attention to the information given in <<table-sync-import-options>>.
. *Save* the settings.

[[table-sync-import-options]]
.Import options for syncs
[cols="1,2"]
|====
|Import option |Explanation

|*Select an import option*
a|

* *Import new data, update existing* = If data can be found by means of the matching fields, a new data record, e.g. a new item or a new order, is added. At the same time, existing data is updated.
* *Only update existing data* = Existing data is updated. If no data can be found by means of the matching fields, the data record is not imported.
* *Only import new data* = Only new data records are imported, i.e. any data for which no matching data is found based on the synchronisation fields.

|*Decimal number*
a|Select *German spelling* or *English spelling*.

* *German spelling* = Decimal numbers are separated by a comma and a full stop serves as thousands separator.
* *English spelling* = Decimal numbers are separated by a full stop and a comma serves as thousands separator.

|*Data format*
|Enter the date format. If the date in the file corresponds to the standard format Y-m-d H:i:s, it is not necessary to enter another format. Other formats, however, must be entered here. All link:http://php.net/manual/en/function.date.php[php-compliant date formats^] are allowed.

|====

[#1400]
== Setting the matching

After you created a sync, open it to carry out further settings. First, you select the fields that should be used for matching the data. Determine what should happen if no existing data can be found during the matching process.

[NOTE]
.Matching is optional
====
Matching fields are optional settings. If you do not select a matching field, the data in your file cannot be assigned to existing data in your system. You can determine one, multiple or all matching fields. The displayed matching fields are different for each sync type.
====

[.instruction]
Setting the matching:

. Go to *Data » ElasticSync*.
. Click on the sync within the sync overview.
. Click on *Matching*.
. Carry out the settings.
. *Save* the settings.

[#1500]
== Creating the mapping

With a mapping, you specify which column of your file corresponds to which data field in your system. Without this mapping, no data can be imported.

[.instruction]
Determining the mapping:

. Go to *Data » ElasticSync*.
. Click on the sync within the sync overview.
. Click on *Mapping*.
. Click on *Add mapping*.
. Enter a name for the mapping.
. Enter a position for the mapping (optional).
. *Save* the settings. +
→ The available mapping fields differ according to the sync type.
. Select the data fields for the mapping by placing a checkmark in the fields. +
→ The selected data fields are added to the mapping.
. Select a column from your file for each data field or select the option *Own value*.
. *Save* the settings.

[NOTE]
.Limitation for mappings
====
The maximum number of possible characters for mappings is 65535.
====

[NOTE]
.Own value
====
The option *Own value* allows to import a fix value for the data field. This fix value is thus identical for each data record that is imported via this sync.
====

[#1510]
=== Activating lines of a mapping for the import

In the *Mapping* section, you can activate all lines for the import with just one click. Alternatively, you can decide individually for each line whether you want it to be active or inactive, thus, whether it should be considered in the import or not.

[.instruction]
Activating lines for the import:

. Go to *Data » ElasticSync*. +
→ The overview opens.
. Click on a sync. +
→ The *Mapping* overview opens.
. Click on a mapping. +
→ The mapping opens.
. On the left, click on *Activate all*, in order to consider all lines in the import.
. Alternatively, in a line, click on *Activate line* in order to just consider this line in the import.
. *Save* the settings.

[NOTE]
.View of the mapping
====
On the left side of the mapping you can see the import data of the CSV file that have to be mapped on the plentymarkets page. The plentymarkets data fields are shown on the right. The preview displays the first 6 values of the CSV file.
====

[#1520]
=== Replacing values with the RegEx function

In order to consider a CSV file during the import as desired, the so-called RegEx function can be applied. Thanks to this function, data is manipulated during the import through commands. Thus, no changes need to be made to the CSV file anymore.

The following two examples will give an overview of the process.

*Example 1*: +
*Input*: “24.12.2017” +
Search pattern*: /^(\d+)\.(\d+)\.(\d+)$/ +
*Replace pattern*: $3﹣$2﹣$1 +
*Result*: “2017-12-24”

*Example 2*: +
*Input*: “Doe, John” +
*Search pattern*: /^(\w+), (\w+)$/ +
*Replace pattern*: $2 $1 +
*Result*: “John Doe” +

*Explanation of the examples*: +
Right at the beginning, there is the input. In a first step, the pattern to be searched for is inserted as search pattern. Afterwards, in the replace pattern, it is changed in such a way that it is output during the import as required. Finally, the result is output in the desired pattern which will be considered in the CSV file.

[.instruction]
Replacing values:

. Go to *Data » ElasticSync*.
. Click on a sync. +
→ The mapping opens.
. In the field *Source*, select the value *Regular expression*. +
→ The options for *Regular expression* open.
. In the field *Value*, enter the column name of the CSV file (e.g. Package number, Order ID etc.).
. In the field *Search*, enter the Search pattern.
. In the field *Replace*, enter the Replace pattern.
. *Save* the settings. +
→ The data fields are updated.

[NOTE]
.Info about RegEx
====
For further information on the RegEx function, see link:http://php.net/manual/en/reference.pcre.pattern.syntax.php[this^] page or link:https://regexr.com/[this^] page.
On the latter, the RegEx engine setting has to be changed to PCRE. This can be done in the dropdown menu on the top right where Javascript is preset.
====

[#1520]
=== Own assignment

With the own assignment you can assign existing values in a CSV file to other values in the system. This enables to define, which value is supposed to be imported for which ID. In addition, if there is no assignment defined for a value in the CSV file, you can specify a default value. If no default value is specified, the original value is imported.

[.instruction]
Defining an own assignment:

. Go to *Data » ElasticSync*. +
→ The overview opens.
. Click on a sync. +
→ The overview of the mapping opens.
. Click on a mapping. +
→ The mapping opens.
. In the dropdown menu of the field *Source*, select the option *Own assignment*.
. Fill in the fields. Pay attention to the information given in <<table-own-assignment>>.
. *Save* the settings.

[[table-own-assignment]]
Own assignment
[cols="1,3"]
|====
|Field |Setting

|Type
|Name of the CSV column (e.g. Delivery country)

|Default value
|Value, if no assignment was found (e.g. 1)

|From
|Original value in the CSV file (e.g. DE for Germany)

|To
|Value, to which the original value shall be mapped (e.g. 1 for DE, 10 for GB etc.)
|====

[#1530]
=== Manipulating an import file via the own assignment

In the following section we will demonstrate the usage of the own assignment shown by the example of *activating the shipping profile*. +
For this procedure, an item/a variant as well as a shipping profile has to exist.

[[image-importing-data]]
.Shipping profile
image::data/importing-data/assets/en-elasticsync-shipping-profile.png[]

In order to link an item/a variant to a shipping profile, the ID is needed. Only with the name of the shipping profile that is shown in the import file, no link can be created.

[[image-importing-data]]
.Item ID
image::data/importing-data/assets/en-elasticsync-item-id.png[]

Use the own assignment in ElasticSync, which manipulates the data during the import. As source for the import data, select the value *Own assignment*.

[[image-importing-data]]
.Own assignment
image::data/importing-data/assets/en-elasticsync-own-assignment.png[]

For *type*, select the column from the import file. In this case, it is the column *Shipping profile*.

[[image-importing-data]]
.Select column from import file
image::data/importing-data/assets/en-elasticsync-type.png[]

Determine, which value in the import file is to be changed to which value, in order to successfully carry out the import. In this case, DPD shall be changed to the ID of the shipping profile (here ID 7). You can also do this for several shipping profiles by adding further own assignments. Afterwards, carry out the import. The shipping profile is linked.

[[image-importing-data]]
.Determining a value
image::data/importing-data/assets/en-elasticsync-determine-value.png[]

The own assignment can be used for many other cases. This applies in particular where internal IDs of plentymarkets play a role (e.g. characteristic names, item flags, payment methods, country ISO codes etc.).

[#1600]
== Filtering import data

You can use filters to limit the data to be imported. You find the filters in the *Mapping* area.

[NOTE]
.Multiple filters are linked with an AND condition
====
If you use multiple filters, only those data records are imported that correspond with all filters. Thus, the filters are linked with an AND condition.
====

[.instruction]
Adding the filter:

. Go to *Data » ElasticSync*.
. Click on the sync within the sync overview. +
. Click on *Mapping*. +
→ An overview of the mapping is displayed.
. Open the mapping.
. Click on *Filter* in the toolbar.
. Select the column from your file that you would like to filter.
. Select an operator.
. Enter a value.
. Click on *Add filter*. +
→ The filter is saved.
. Add additional filters as necessary. +
→ Only data that meets all filter criteria is imported.


[#1620]
== Report of sync import

A report is available in the overview of a sync. This report shows all imported rows including the success and error messages, which can be opened by clicking on the *Message* column. Use the filter in order to retrieve specific sync data.

[#1630]
== Copying syncs

It is possible to copy one sync or multiple syncs at the same time. In this way, you can use syncs that you have already configured in order to quickly create a new sync.

[.instruction]
Copying syncs:

. Go to *Data » ElasticSync*.
. Activate one or multiple syncs.
. Click on *Copy sync*. +
→ The sync is copied. *(copy)* is added behind a copied sync.

[#1640]
== Exporting and importing a sync

You can import and export syncs. Furthermore, you can save syncs locally and import syncs from other users.

[.instruction]
Exporting and importing a sync:

. Go to *Data » ElasticSync*.
. Activate one or multiple syncs.
. Click on *Export sync*. +
→ The sync is automatically downloaded.
. Click on *Import sync*. +
→ The option *Import sync* is expanded below the menu.
. Click on *Select file*. +
→ The file browser opens.
. Click on *Upload file* and select the file.
. Place a checkmark next to the file that you would like to upload and click on *Select*. +
→ The file is added.
. Click on *Import*. +
→ The sync is imported.

[NOTE]
.Importing syncs from another plentymarkets system
====
If you would like to import syncs from another plentymarkets system, you have to adjust the matching and mapping settings. It is only possible to import *.json* files.
====

[#1700]
== Testing the sync and importing data

It is possible to test and carry out syncs. Testing allows you to quickly know whether your file can be imported correctly.

[NOTE]
.Testing the sync
====
If you select *Test sync*, only the first ten lines of the import file are imported.
====

[#1710]
== Processing jobs in the queue

The queue enables the import of large amounts of data. Before being imported, the import file is broken down into packages and processed in so-called jobs. A job consists of 750 lines of a CSV file. However, import files with less than 750 lines also make a job. Whenever a sync is started, the CSV file is split up into the respective jobs and is put into the queue. In the queue, new jobs are permanently retrieved and the syncs are processed. There are two different statuses. The status *Open jobs* means that there are jobs in the queue waiting to be processed. *Completed jobs* on the contrary have already been processed and the data have been imported.

[#1720]
== Activating/deactivating mappings

If you manage several mappings in the same sync, you can deactivate or activate specific mappings of the sync in the mapping overview by clicking on the button in the column *Active/Inactive*. New mappings are active by default.
