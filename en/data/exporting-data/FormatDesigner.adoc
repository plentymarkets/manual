The FormatDesigner is part of the ElasticSync plugin and allows you to create formats for exporting using the ElasticExport. All formats created with FormatDesigner are available in the *Data » Elastic export* menu. Using the FormatDesigner, you can not only set CSV options and select data fields, but also manipulate numeric data values during export.

[TIP]
.Plugin updated?
====
The FormatDesigner is part of the ElasticSync plugin. ElasticSync is constantly updated and improved. As such, go to *Plugins » Plugin overview » Open plugin set* and check that you use the latest version of ElasticSync before creating syncs or exporting formats.

= General settings

[#100]
== Create format

. Go to *Data » FormatDesigner*.
. Click on *Add format*.
. Enter a unique name.
. Select the desired format and field separator.
. *Save* the settings.

[#110]
== Editing the format

As soon as a format is created or opened, the editing window for the format opens. There you will find all available data fields. By clicking on a field, this field is added to the left side of the screen. Once a data field has been created, it can be further edited. Once the data field was saved it is added to the export.

|Setting |Explanation

|Name
|Enter a name for the data format. The name is displayed in the column header of the CSV file.

|Move
|Left of the data field name is a section marked with dots where you can move and position the data fields. You specify the order of the columns of the CSV file by moving the data fields.

|Mapping
|Data fields, e.g. VariationSalesPrice.price, require additional mapping because more than one price may exist for every variation. The mapping allows you to export a specific sales price. To export more than one sales price, you can add the data field to the export format several times and map these fields to different sales prices. For data fields that do not require any additional mapping, the button is deactivated.

|Change value
|Data fields with numeric values can be changed with procedures during the export. As many procedures can be added as desired. These procedures are carried out sequentially and manipulate the value based on the setting selected.

|Remove data field
|The data field will be removed from the format.
