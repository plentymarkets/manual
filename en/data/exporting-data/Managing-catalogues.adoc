Catalogues are used to ideally prepare data for the export. Here, a distinction is made between catalogues with marketplace formats and catalogues with standard formats.

You want to prepare variation data for the export to a sales channel?
Use <<data/exporting-data/managing-catalogues#40, catalogues with marketplace formats>> to export variation data to markets and other sales channels. Currently, you can use catalogues to transfer data to the markets REWE, Etsy, Metro, OTTO Market and Amazon.

You want to export specific data such as order or item data from your plentymarkets system? Use <<data/exporting-data/managing-catalogues#110, catalogues with a standard format>> to export such data. +
*_Note_*: The standard formats will be transferred to the catalogue step by step. For now, there is only a demo format available.

On this manual page, you will find information on creating and managing catalogues. At first, the focus will be put on the marketplace formats.

=== Assigning user rights for back end users

Users of the type *Back end* can only access limited areas and menus in the plentymarkets back end. Thus, their access to the system is limited. If users of the type *Back end* should be able to see catalogues, a user of the type *Admin* has to assign the right listed in the following to users of the type *Back end*.

[.instruction]
Assigning user rights for back end users:

. Go to *Setup » Settings » User » Rights » User*.
. Use the search function (icon:search[role="blue"]) and open the account that should be edited.
. In the *Authorisations* section, activate the option *Data > Data exchange > Export > Catalog > Show*.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

== What is a catalogue?

Each sales channel requires different product data. Often, different product information have to be sent to the same sales channel for different product categories (pet food, household items, food, etc.).

Catalogues with marketplace formats allow you to customise information regarding your product portfolio to meet the requirements of each sales channel and target audience. You achieve this by mapping the individual data fields of a sales channel to a suitable plentymarkets data source. When your variation data is transferred to the sales channel, the sales channel’s data fields are then filled with the correct plentymarkets data.

Catalogues with marketplace formats offer the following advantages:

* The sales channel provides the data structure. As such, you know exactly which variation data is necessary to sell your products on this sales channel.
* You select which variation data you want to publish on each sales channel and for each format. For example, you can use properties to transfer different variation names and descriptions to different sales channels.

[#20]
== What is a marketplace format?

A marketplace format provides a framework of the data a sales channel can accept. As such, marketplace formats tell you what data can be transmitted to the sales channel.

A sales channel can offer more than one marketplace format, for example for different product categories (pet food, food, non-food, etc.) or for different languages. Check the documentation of the respective sales channel to find out which marketplace formats are available.

[TIP]
.Could not find a marketplace format?
====
The marketplace formats of some sales channel are only loaded into the *Data » Catalogues* menu when you deploy the sales channel’s plugin.
====

[#30]
== Managing variation data using properties

<<item/managing-items#3000, Properties of the Item area>> allow you to save data for variations for which no default data fields are available in the plentymarkets back end. In the following, you will find some examples on how to use properties.

==== Example 1: Diameter information

*Use case:* +
A sales channel allows you to send the *diameter* and the *diameter unit* of your products. By default, you cannot save diameter data in the plentymarkets back end.

*Recommended:* +
<<table-diameter>> shows the recommended settings for sending diameter data to sales channels.

====

[#80]
=== Mapping and linking data fields

In the *Mapping* tab of a catalogue you can map the sales channel’s data sources to your plentymarkets data fields. Depending on the product data you want to transfer, you either map a data field or a value. For example, you select which data field in plentymarkets contains the weight of variations. In the lower section you can map values. For example, you map the sales channel’s category “Pet food” to your plentymarkets category “Animal food”.

For the export of a data field you can map as many sources as you like. To do so, add further sources and select a separator for each combination. Moreover, you can add so-called fallback data fields. In case a value does not exist, you can define here which value should be exported instead.

[TIP]
====
.Additional mapping for specific data fields
Data fields such as VariationSalesPrice.price require an additional mapping, because more than one price may exist for each variation. The mapping allows you to export a specific sales price. To export more than one sales price, you can add the data field several times. Data fields that require additional mapping have a drop-down list. The default value is always preselected.
====

[NOTE]
.No free text fields or characteristics
====
Free text fields and characteristics have been replaced by properties. Thus, you cannot transfer free text fields and characteristics to sales channels anymore. Use the properties instead.
====

Proceed as described below to map the data fields of the sales channel to a plentymarkets data source.

[.instruction]
Mapping and linking data fields:

. Go to *Data » Catalogues*. +
→ The catalogue overview opens.
. Open a catalogue. +
→ The *Mapping* tab with the sales channel’s data fields opens. +
*_Tip_*: Mandatory fields are marked with an asterisk.
. Click on *Add data field*. +
→ The available plentymarkets data fields are displayed on the left.

. If you selected *Own value*, enter a value into the input field below.
. Click on *Add data field* (icon:link[rotate=90]) on the right in order to map another plentymarkets data source to a data field. +
→ The editing mode opens.
. Select any amount of data fields or *Own value*. If you selected *Own value*, enter a value into the input field below.
. Close the editing mode via the X or by clicking outside the window.
. On the right in the data row, click on *Settings* (icon:cog[]) to select a separator. +
→ The window *Data column settings* opens.
. Select a separator from the drop-down list or add an own separator. +
. *Save* the settings. +
→ The data fields are linked and will be exported with the respectively selected separator. +
*_Note_*: If a data field in a combination does not exist, only the remaining data fields will be exported. +
*_Optional_*: Click on *Add fallback data field* to select a data field that is exported in case another one is not available. For this, you can also select several data fields.
. Map the desired data fields.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings. +
→ The mappings are saved.

[TIP]
.Replacing data fields
====
Do you want to replace a data field in a specific position without having to delete linked data fields and to select new ones again? To do so, click on the further actions (icon:ellipsis-v[]) on the right of the data field you want to replace and select a new one.
====

[#90]
=== Deleting data fields

In the *Mapping* tab of a catalogue with a marketplace format you can delete individual or several data fields at once. When using marketplace formats, you can also remove the selected fallback data fields.

[.instruction]
