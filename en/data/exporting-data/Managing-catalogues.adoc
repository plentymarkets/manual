[IMPORTANT]
.Catalogues are a new feature!
====
Catalogues are a new feature for exporting variation data to markets and other sales channels. In the pilot phase, you can create catalogues for the German market REWE. Additional markets will follow soon.
====

Catalogues are used to prepare variation data for exporting them to a sales channel. On this manual page, you will find information on creating and managing catalogues.

[#10]
== What is a catalogue?

Each sales channel requires different product data. Often, different product information must be sent to the same sales channel for different product categories (pet food, household items, food, etc.).

Catalogues allow you to customise information regarding your product portfolio to meet the requirements of each sales channel and target audience. You achieve this by mapping the individual data fields of a sales channel to a suitable plentymarkets data source. When your variation data is transferred to the sales channel, the sales channel’s data fields are then filled with the correct plentymarkets data.

Catalogues offer the following advantages:

* The sales channel provides the data structure. As such, you know exactly which variation data is necessary to sell your products on this sales channel.
* You select which variation data you want to publish on each sales channel and for each template. For example, you can use properties to transfer different variation names and descriptions to different sales channels.

[TIP]
.Exporting data? FormatDesigner
====
Catalogues are used to transmit data to sales channels. Catalogue data cannot be exported to a file or any other readable format. Use the <<data/exporting-data/FormatDesigner#, FormatDesigner>> to export data.
====

[#20]
== What is a catalogue template?

A catalogue template provides a framework of the data a sales channel can accept. As such, catalogue templates tell you what data can be transmitted to the sales channel.

A sales channel can offer more than one catalogue template, for example for different product categories (pet food, food, non-food, etc.) and/or for different languages. Catalogue templates are loaded into the plentymarkets back end by deploying the plugin for the sales channel. Check the plugin documentation to find out which catalogue templates are available for the different sales channels.

[NOTE]
.No catalogue template without plugin
====
The catalogue templates of a sales channel are loaded into the *Data » Catalogues* menu when you deploy the sales channel’s plugin.

== Managing variation data using properties

<<item/managing-items#3000, Properties of the Item area>> allow you to save data for variations for which no default data fields are available in the plentymarkets back end.

==== Example 1: Diameter information

*Use case:* +
A sales channel allows you to send the *diameter* and the *diameter unit* of your products. By default, you cannot save diameter data in the plentymarkets back end.

*Recommended:* +
<<table-diameter>> shows the recommended settings for sending diameter data to sales channels.

==== Example 2: Brand names

*Use case:* +
The sales channel allows you to transfer the brand name of products. By default, you can save manufacturers but not brand names in the plentymarkets back end.

*Recommended:* +
If the manufacturer names saved in your system are not identical to the products’ brand names, you can manage brand names using properties. <<table-brands>> shows the recommended settings for managing brands to send to sales channels.

== Managing catalogues

The *Data » Catalogues* menu becomes visible in the plentymarkets back end once you deploy a plugin that makes catalogue templates available. Use this menu to create, edit or delete catalogues.

[#50]
=== Creating a catalogue

Proceed as described below to create a catalogue.

[.instruction]
Creating a catalogue:

. Go to *Data » Catalogues*. +
→ The catalogue overview opens.
. Click on *Create catalogue*.
. Enter a name for the catalogue.
. Select a catalogue template from the drop-down list.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings. +
→ The catalogue is created. +
→ The catalogue is opened for editing.

[#60]
=== Mapping data sources

Once you created a catalogue, the catalogue opens. On the left, the sales channel’s data is shown. Fields with an asterisk are mandatory. Further on the right of each data field is a drop-down list. Use these drop-down lists to map one or more plentymarkets data sources to the data fields of the sales channel.

Depending on the product data you want to transfer, you either map a data field or a value. In the upper area, you can map data fields. For example, you select which data field in plentymarkets contains the weight of variations. In the lower section, you can map values. For example, you map the sales channel’s category “Pet food” to your plentymarkets category “Animal food”.

Proceed as described below to map the data fields of the sales channel to a plentymarkets data source.

[.instruction]
Mapping data sources:

. Go to *Data » Catalogues*. +
→ The catalogue overview opens.
. Click on the catalogue. +
→ The catalogue opens. +
→ On the left, the sales channel’s data fields are displayed. +
*_Tip:_* Fields with an asterisk are mandatory. +
→ In the middle, drop-down lists with plentymarkets data sources are displayed. +
. From the drop-down list, select a plentymarkets source for the data fields of the sales channel. +
*_Note:_* Check the information in the user guide of the sales channel’s plugin for details on the target data fields. <<table-catalogue-fields>> contains information regarding the plentymarkets data sources and how to map these data sources. +
. To map another plentymarkets source to a data field, click on *Add source* on the right. +
→ A new line is added. +
*_Note:_* Even if you map more than one data source to a data field, only one value is transferred to the sales channel. The data is checked in the order in which they were mapped. So if the first data field does not contain a value, the second data field is transmitted, etc.
. Map all data you want to send to the sales channel.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings. +
→ The mappings are saved.
