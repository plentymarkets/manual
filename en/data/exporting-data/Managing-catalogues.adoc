Catalogues are used to ideally prepare data for the export. Here, a distinction is made between catalogues with marketplace formats and catalogues with standard formats.

You want to prepare variation data for the export to a sales channel?
Use <<data/exporting-data/managing-catalogues#40, catalogues with marketplace formats>> to export variation data to markets and other sales channels. Currently, you can use catalogues to transfer data to the markets REWE, Etsy, Metro, OTTO Market and Amazon.

You want to export specific data such as order or item data from your plentymarkets system? Use <<data/exporting-data/managing-catalogues#110, catalogues with a standard format>> to export such data. +
*_Note_*: The standard formats will be transferred to the catalogue step by step. At the moment, only the format *Manufacturer* is available.

On this manual page, you will find information on creating and managing catalogues. At first, the focus will be put on the marketplace formats.


[discrete]
=== Assigning user rights for back end users

Users of the type *Back end* can only access limited areas and menus in the plentymarkets back end. Thus, their access to the system is limited. If users of the type *Back end* should be able to see catalogues, a user of the type *Admin* has to assign the right listed in the following to users of the type *Back end*.

[.instruction]
Assigning user rights for back end users:

. Go to *Setup » Settings » User » Rights » User*.
. Use the search function (icon:search[role="blue"]) and open the account that should be edited.
. In the *Authorisations* section, activate the option *Data > Data exchange > Export > Catalog > Show*.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

== What is a catalogue?

Each sales channel requires different product data. Often, different product information have to be sent to the same sales channel for different product categories (pet food, household items, food, etc.).

Catalogues with marketplace formats allow you to customise information regarding your product portfolio to meet the requirements of each sales channel and target audience. You achieve this by mapping the individual data fields of a sales channel to a suitable plentymarkets data source. When your variation data is transferred to the sales channel, the sales channel’s data fields are then filled with the correct plentymarkets data.

Catalogues with marketplace formats offer the following advantages:

* The sales channel provides the data structure. As such, you know exactly which variation data is necessary to sell your products on this sales channel.
* You select which variation data you want to publish on each sales channel and for each format. For example, you can use properties to transfer different variation names and descriptions to different sales channels.

[#15]
=== Customising the table in the catalogue overview

The table in the catalogue overview is customisable. This means that you can decide which information is displayed in the table columns. To do so, proceed as follows:

[.instruction]
Customising the table in the catalogue overview:

. Go to *Data » Catalogues*. +
→ The catalogue overview opens.
. At the top right, click on *Configure columns* (icon:cog[]). +
→ The window *Configure columns* opens.
. Select which columns you want to be displayed.
. Move (icon:drag_sort_handle[set=plenty]) the columns so they are displayed in the desired order.
. Click on *Confirm* to save your settings.

[#20]
== What is a marketplace format?

A marketplace format provides a framework of the data a sales channel can accept. As such, marketplace formats tell you what data can be transmitted to the sales channel.

A sales channel can offer more than one marketplace format, for example for different product categories (pet food, food, non-food, etc.) or for different languages. Check the documentation of the respective sales channel to find out which marketplace formats are available.

[TIP]
.Could not find a marketplace format?
====
The marketplace formats of some sales channel are only loaded into the *Data » Catalogues* menu when you deploy the sales channel’s plugin.
====

[#30]
== Managing variation data using properties

<<item/managing-items#3000, Properties of the Item area>> allow you to save data for variations for which no default data fields are available in the plentymarkets back end. In the following, you will find some examples on how to use properties.

==== Example 1: Diameter information

*Use case:* +
A sales channel allows you to send the *diameter* and the *diameter unit* of your products. By default, you cannot save diameter data in the plentymarkets back end.

*Recommended:* +
<<table-diameter>> shows the recommended settings for sending diameter data to sales channels.

[#80]
=== Mapping and linking data fields

In the *Mapping* tab of a catalogue you can map the sales channel’s data sources to your plentymarkets data fields. Depending on the product data you want to transfer, you either map a data field or a value. For example, you select which data field in plentymarkets contains the weight of variations. In the lower section you can map values. For example, you map the sales channel’s category “Pet food” to your plentymarkets category “Animal food”.

For the export of a data field you can map as many sources as you like. To do so, add further sources and select a separator for each combination. Moreover, you can add so-called fallback data fields. In case a value does not exist, you can define here which value should be exported instead.

[TIP]
====
.Additional assignment for specific data fields
Data fields such as VariationSalesPrice.price require an additional assignment, because more than one price may exist for each variation. The assignment allows you to export a specific sales price. To export more than one sales price, you can add the data field several times. Data fields that require an additional assignment have a drop-down list. The default value is always preselected.
====

[NOTE]
.No free text fields or characteristics
====
Free text fields and characteristics have been replaced by properties. Thus, you cannot transfer free text fields and characteristics to sales channels anymore. Use the properties instead.
====

[TIP]
.Adding all data fields of a group at once
====
If you want to add all data fields of a group to a catalogue at once, click on the plus on the right of the group.
====

Proceed as described below to map the data fields of the sales channel to a plentymarkets data source.

[.instruction]
Mapping and linking data fields:

. Go to *Data » Catalogues*. +
→ The catalogue overview opens.
. Click on a catalogue. +
→ The *Mapping* tab (icon:order_return_create_edit[set=plenty[) with the marketplace data fields opens. +
*_Tip_*: Mandatory fields are marked with an asterisk.
. To the right of the first marketplace data field, click on *Add data field*. +
→ The editing mode opens and the available plentymarkets data fields are displayed as groups on the left.
. Click on a group to expand the associated data fields. +
→ The data fields are shown.
. Next to the data field you want to select, click on the plus. +
→ The data field is added to the view. +
icon:map-signs[] *_Or:_* Enter the name of the data field into the search field and navigate to the desired entry. Afterwards, press Enter to add it to the view. +
*_Tip_*: Do you want to export a fixed value for every variation for one of the marketplace data fields? Click on the plus next to *Own value*. +
→ The field for the own value is added to the view.
. If you selected *Own value*, enter a value into the input field below.
. Close the editing mode via the X or by clicking outside the window. +
*_Optional_*: Click on *Add fallback data field* to select a data field that is exported in case another one is not available. You can also add more than one fallback data field. +
*_Optional_*: To map another data field to an existing one, click on *Add data field* (icon:link[rotate=90]) on the right. +
→ The editing mode opens.
. Next to the data field you want to select, click on the plus or select *Own value*. +
→ The data field is added to the view.
. Close the editing mode via the X or by clicking outside the window.
. On the right in the data row, click on *Settings* (icon:cog[]) to select a separator for linking the data fields. +
→ The window *Data column settings* opens.
. Select a separator from the drop-down list or add an own separator. +
. *Save* the settings. +
→ The data fields are linked and will be exported with the respectively selected separator. +
*_Note_*: If a data field in a combination does not exist, only the remaining data fields will be exported.
. Map the desired data fields.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings. +
→ The mappings are saved.

[TIP]
.Own value
====
The option *Own value* allows you to export a fixed value for a data field. This fixed value is thus identical for each data record that is exported via this catalogue.
====

[TIP]
.Replacing data fields
====
Do you want to replace a data field in a specific position without having to delete linked data fields and to select new ones again? To do so, click on the further actions (icon:ellipsis-v[]) on the right of the data field you want to replace and select a new one.
====

[TIP]
.Moving data fields in a mapping
====
When mapping data fields, you can move each data field as desired. To do so, go to the respective data field and drag and drop it to the desired position.
====

[#85]
=== Transferring combined mappings to a marketplace

Combined mappings allow you to transfer data fields that have a dependency to a marketplace. +
_Example_ (see image below): You want to transfer the data field *Barcode* and additionally need the Barcode type *ASIN*. Therefore, you specify the Barcode type *ASIN* as additional information and define that this will be transferred, if the data field *Barcode* can be filled with the value from the plentymarkets data field *Amazon Germany*. +
If this is not possible, because no value can be found, the next possibility is checked. Thus, the Barcode type *GTIN* will be transferred to the marketplace, if the data field *Barcode* can be filled with the value from the plentymarkets data field *GTIN 13* _or_ *GTIN 128*. +
*_Note:_* In case none of the defined possibilities applies, neither *Barcode* nor *Barcode type* will be transferred.

image::data/exporting-data/assets/combined-mappings.png[]

[#90]
=== Deleting data fields

In the *Mapping* tab of a catalogue with a marketplace format you can delete individual or several data fields at once. You can also remove the selected fallback data fields.

[.instruction]
Deleting data fields:

. Go to *Data » Catalogues*. +
→ The catalogue overview opens.
. Open a catalogue with marketplace format. +
→ The *Mapping* tab (icon:order_return_create_edit[set=plenty[) with all available data fields opens.
. Click on the further actions (icon:ellipsis-v[]) on the right of the data field that you want to delete.
. Click on *Delete data field* (icon:trash-o[]). +
→ The data field is deleted. +
icon:map-signs[] *_Or_*: On the right side in the data row, click on *Reset* (icon:undo[]). +
→ All data fields that have been added to the data row are deleted. *_Note_*: This only works for data fields that have just been added, but have not been saved yet.

=== Adding and linking data fields

In catalogues with standard formats, you can also add and link several data fields for the export from your plentymarkets system. Moreover, you can add so-called fallback data fields. In case a value does not exist, you can define here which value should be exported instead.

[TIP]
.Determining an export key for added data fields
====
To the left of newly added data fields, you can enter an export key. All values of the respective row will then be exported under the key name. Make sure that the key is unique and do not use any special characters such as spaces . / etc.
====

.Own value
====
The option *Own value* allows you to export a fixed value for a data field. This fixed value is thus identical for each data record that is exported via this catalogue.
====

[TIP]
.Determining the order of CSV columns
====
You can move single data fields or whole columns as desired and thus determine the order in which the data fields are exported. If you want to move a single data field, go to the data field and drag and drop it to the desired position. However, if you want to move a whole column, click on the symbol (icon:ellipsis-v[] icon:ellipsis-v[]) on the left side and drag and drop it to the desired position.
