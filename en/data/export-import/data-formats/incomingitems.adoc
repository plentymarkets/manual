The **IncomingItems** special format is used to import incoming items. This data format is available as a special format in the **Data Â» Dynamic import** menu. You may want to import the current stock if you are using an external stock management system and you simply want to compare the stock with plentymarkets.

With the **IncomingItems** data format, you only import certain incoming items data records and not the entire stock. If you want to import the entire stock, refer to the <<data/export-import/importing-data#120, Importing stock>> chapter on the <<data/export-import/importing-data#, Importing data>> page of the manual.

Pay close attention to the exact spelling of the data fields. The data cannot be processed if the data fields are spelled incorrectly.
